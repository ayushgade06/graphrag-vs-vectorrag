    "Passage 1:\nGrown Ups (film)\nGrown Ups is a 2010 American comedy film directed by Dennis Dugan, written by Adam Sandler and Fred Wolf, produced by Sandler and Jack Giarraputo, and starring Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Rob Schneider, Salma Hayek, Maria Bello, and Maya Rudolph. The film tells a story of five lifelong friends who won their junior high school basketball championship in 1978. They reunite three decades later for a 4th of July weekend after learning about the sudden death of their basketball coach.\nProduced by Sandler's Happy Madison Productions in association with Relativity Media, Grown Ups was released in the United States on June 25, 2010, by Columbia Pictures. Despite receiving unfavorable reviews from critics, it grossed $272 million and led to a sequel, Grown Ups 2, in 2013.\n\nPlot\nIn 1978, childhood friends Lenny Feder, Eric Lamonsoff, Kurt McKenzie, Marcus Higgins, and Rob Hilliard win their junior high basketball championship. They celebrate at a lake house with their coach Robert \"Buzzer\" Ferdinando.\nThirty years later in 2008, Lenny is a wealthy and successful Hollywood talent agent, married to fashion designer Roxanne and has three children: Greg, Keith, and Becky. Eric claims to co-own a lawn furniture company and has two children: Donna and Bean; his wife Sally still breastfeeds Bean. Kurt is a stay-at-home father, and has two children: Andre and Charlotte, his wife Deanne is pregnant with their third child, and her mother Ronzoni lives with them. Marcus is a slacker and lothario. Rob is married to his much older fourth wife Gloria.\nWhen Buzzer dies, the five friends reunite for his funeral in their hometown with their families. Lenny rents the Earnshaw family's lake house for everyone to stay over Fourth of July weekend, though his family is leaving early to attend Roxanne's fashion show in Milan. He pushes his boys to play outside and runs into his childhood opponent Dickie, who claims Lenny's foot was out of bounds when he made the winning shot.\nAs the friends spread Buzzer's ashes, Rob breaks down over his failed marriages and reveals that he has invited his estranged daughters Jasmine, Amber, and Bridget to visit. The men play \u201carrow roulette\u201d, shooting an arrow straight into the air, and Rob wins by not running for cover, but the arrow impales his left foot, causing him to 'snap' at Gloria from the pain. \nLenny is thrilled to find the kids playing with cup-and-string telephones. Realizing the positive impact the weekend is having on their children, Roxanne tells Lenny to cancel their Milan trip and stay at the lake instead.\nEveryone visits Water Wizz where Marcus flirts with Jasmine and Amber after buying them skimpy bikinis, and Eric teaches Bean to drink cow's milk. The families cause chaos throughout the park: the wives attract a bodybuilder, then jeer at his high-pitched Canadian accent; Rob assaults a slide attendant when he insults Bridget, and Eric ignores Donna's warning about a chemical in the pool that turns urine blue. At the zipline attraction, Lenny's group meets up with Dickie, accompanied by his former teammates. One of them, Wiley, is severely injured after crashing into a shed while sliding down the zipline using his feet.\nThe next day, Rob attacks Marcus, mistakenly believing that he slept with Jasmine, and Marcus admits to feeling insecure compared to his happily married friends. Everyone comes clean about the state of their lives: Roxanne confronts Lenny for canceling their flight to Milan before they left home, and he explains he wanted their family to have a normal vacation and to rein in his children's respectful attitudes; Deanne confronts Kurt for spending time with the Feders' nanny Rita, but Kurt retaliates by pointing out how she under-appreciates him; Eric reveals that he was laid off from his job, and was showing off the whole time so the others wouldn't humiliate him; Rob admits what everybody already knows \u2013 that he wears a toupee. Gloria helps everyone reconcile, and Lenny and Kurt offer to help Eric start a new business.\nOn their last day at the lake house, Lenny and his friends agree to a rematch against Dickie, Robideaux, Muzby, Tardio, and Malcolm. The game culminates in Lenny and Greg facing Dickie and his son, but Lenny misses the game-deciding shot. As the families watch the Fourth of July fireworks, Lenny tells Roxanne that he let Dickie's family win to get him off his case, and felt that his own family needed to know what losing feels like. A drunken Marcus plays another game of arrow roulette, and the crowd flees in panic. Trapped in a full-body cast, Wiley is struck in the foot by the arrow.\n\nCast\nProduction\nSandler, Rock, Schneider, and Spade met when they all joined the cast of Saturday Night Live in the 1990\u20131991 season; supporting cast members Colin Quinn, Rudolph, Tim Meadows, and Norm Macdonald have also been SNL cast members.\nFilming commenced in Essex County, Massachusetts, in August 2009.

The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK on 19 June 2010.\n\nPlot\nIsabel Green is driven to her wit's end by her hectic life while her husband Rory fights in World War II. Between trying to keep the family farm up and running and her job in the village shop, run by the slightly mad Mrs. Docherty, she also has three boisterous children to look after, Norman, Megsie and Vincent. When her children's two wealthy, but pompous and snobby city cousins, Cyril and Celia, are evacuated to live with them in the countryside, they start fighting with them, only adding to Isabel's problems.\nWhen the magical Nanny McPhee arrives to help, the children at first do not listen and carry on fighting, which she soon puts a stop to with her magic. Meanwhile, Isabel's brother-in-law Phil has gambled away his half of the farm, and is being chased by two hired female assassins working for casino owner Mrs. Biggles. He desperately attempts to make Isabel sell her half of the farm, using mean and spiteful schemes to leave her no choice; one of the schemes, setting loose a litter of piglets to be sold to a neighbouring farmer, is discovered by the children, leading them to bond as they work together to fix it. Isabel takes everyone on a picnic as a show of thanks, during which Mrs. Docherty's ARP Warden husband warns them about bombs and relates how he imagines a pilot might accidentally release one, and Phil subsequently delivers a telegram saying Rory was killed in action. Everyone believes the news except Norman, who is sure his father is alive because he \"can feel it in [his] bones\". He tells this to Cyril, who at first thinks he is just upset, but then agrees that Norman might be right; the two convince Nanny McPhee to take them to the War Office in London, where Cyril and Celia's father Lord Gray holds an important position, believing he will know the truth.\nAt first Lord Gray sneers at Norman's disbelief at his father's death, but after Cyril reveals that he knows he is divorcing their mother and blasts him for his neglect as a parent, Lord Gray investigates what has happened. While he is gone, Norman asks Cyril where he will live following the divorce; upon learning he rarely sees either of his parents, he says that he and Celia are welcome to live permanently with the Greens. Lord Gray returns and tells Norman that his father is merely missing in action, and that there is no record of a telegram being sent to his mother. After the boys leave, Norman deduces that Phil forged the telegram.\nWhile the older boys are at the War Office, Megsie, Celia and Vincent try to stop Isabel from signing Phil's papers and selling the farm by creating distractions such as pretending that a mouse was in the kitchen. Just as she is about to finally do so, a German pilot accidentally drops a huge bomb on the Greens' barley field; it does not explode, but the fallout is strong enough to cover Phil's papers with ink. When Nanny McPhee, Norman and Cyril return, Phil admits to Norman's accusation of forgery and is handcuffed to the stove by Isabel. The children go out to watch Mr. Docherty defuse the bomb, but when he faints, Megsie takes over, succeeding with the help of the other children and Nanny McPhee's jackdaw friend Mr. Edelweiss. Nanny McPhee helps to harvest the barley with a little magic, saving Phil from Mrs. Biggles' hitwomen in the process. While everyone celebrates, Mrs. Docherty is revealed to be baby Agatha from the first film and to remember Nanny McPhee, who has been staying with her. As Nanny McPhee walks away from the now-happy Isabel and the children, they chase after her, only to see Rory, with an injured arm, making his way back to them. He runs to his family and they embrace.\nIn a mid-credits scene, Ellie, an elephant conjured by Nanny McPhee to share Vincent's bed, is seen enjoying the magically operated Scratch-o-matic invented for the piglets.\n\nCast\nEmma Thompson as Nanny McPhee, the  nanny who changes the lives of the Green and Gray children.\nMaggie Gyllenhaal as Isabel Green (n\u00e9e Carrington), the frazzled mother of Norman, Megsie and Vincent.\nRhys Ifans as Phil Green, Norman, Megsie and Vincent's uncle, Rory's brother and Isabel's brother-in-law, who tries to sell the farm because he gambled it away at a casino.\nAsa Butterfield as Norman Green, the eldest of the Green children.\nLil Woods as Megan \u201cMegsie\u201d Green, the middle and only girl of the Green children.\nOscar Steer as Vincent Green, the youngest of the Green children.\nEros Vlahos as Cyril Gray, the spoiled cousin of Norman, Megsie and Vincent.

It was also written by Allan Loeb with music by Rupert Gregson-Williams. The film co-stars Henry Winkler and Salma Hayek. It was produced by Happy Madison Productions. The film was released in the United States on October 12, 2012, by Columbia Pictures. The film's title is taken from the song \"Boom\" by Christian nu-metal band P.O.D.\n\nPlot\nFormer Division I collegiate wrestler Scott Voss is a 42-year-old bored and disillusioned biology teacher at the failing Wilkinson High School. Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty Streb, being laid off. Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the $48,000 necessary to keep the music program. He moonlights as a night instructor for an adult citizenship class, where student Niko requests outside tutoring. When Scott arrives at Niko's apartment, he learns that Niko is a former MMA fighter. While watching the UFC at Niko's apartment, Scott learns that the loser of a fight receives $10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting and losing in MMA.\nScott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only $750 to the loser. Niko begins training him in defense, later adding trainer Mark to teach offense, after Scott knocks out opponent \"Lucky\" Patrick Murray and realizes that wins give larger payouts, needing fewer fights to achieve his goal. While Marty trains with Scott, Malia De La Cruz, one of Scott's students and a band member, helps Niko study for his citizenship test by putting the information into songs. Scott then begins fighting in small MMA fights and gradually gains greater amounts of money for the school.\nScott has been pursuing the school nurse, Bella Flores, and they share moments flirting with each other, while also rekindling Scott's passion for teaching. He begins to engage the class and earns the respect of his students. Scott is within $6,000 of his goal when Mark tells him that Niko turned down a sanctioned UFC fight offered by Joe Rogan, with the certainty of earning $10,000 for a loss. Scott confronts Niko, who apologizes and admits he turned it down because he was jealous as he was once asked to fight at the UFC but suffered a neck injury while training, ending his career. Scott and Niko accept the offer, and they travel to the MGM Grand Las Vegas for the fight. The night he arrives, Bella calls Scott to tell him that the school's vice principal Robert Elkins has been arrested for embezzling from the school, including Scott's winnings. All Scott's efforts have been in vain, and he decides he must win the fight and the $50,000.\nThe publicity of Scott's rise to fame has grown, and the school's band appears in the stands to play his theme song, \"Holly Holy\" by Neil Diamond, thanks to Bella contacting Rogan. During the fight, Marty reminds the losing Scott that even if he does not win, he has inspired the students, which is their real purpose as teachers. Scott has no answer to his dangerous opponent Ken Dietrich, who is angered that his original opponent canceled and that he is stuck with a man that \"does not deserve\" to be fighting at the UFC. Scott struggles to survive the first two rounds, but after finding inspiration from the students, he manages to win in the third and final round of the fight, earning $50,000 and Dietrich's respect. Scott and Bella kiss through the chain link fence of the ring.\nIn the closing scene, the music program is saved, the school is operating on a normal budget thanks to Scott's donation and Niko and all of the students in Scott's citizenship class attend their American citizenship ceremony.\n\nCast\nProduction\nFilming began on March 28, 2011, in and around the Boston, Massachusetts, area.

The website's consensus reads, \"Here Comes the Boom benefits from Kevin James's genial presence, but the film doesn't deliver enough laughs to live up to its title \u2013 or enough satisfying plot to make up the difference.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 40 out of 100, based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.USA Today's Scott Bowles says the film \"telegraphs every punch ... but when the comedy connects, it can deliver with funny force\". He says, \"The film suffers from too many side stories, but it does a nice job capturing the heavyweight battles of everyday folk.\" \nMichael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune writes: \"Once it gets going and commits to its time-worn inspirational formula, it's not half-bad.\" Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote: \"If you can choke down the implausible notion that the doughy Kevin James would last more than five seconds in a mixed martial arts ring, Here Comes the Boom is a moderately enjoyable, nontaxing sort of comedy.\"John Anderson of Variety magazine wrote: \"Hands of stone meet heads of air in Here Comes the Boom, a sports story so daffy it may as well star Kevin James.\" He called the film \"a triumph of recycling\" comparing it to Rocky. Anderson is critical of the different clashing tones of the film, but calls the characters likable, and writes the \"violence adds a frisson of tension to the pic\u2019s mix of grappling, romance and anemic social critique.\"Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum called it \"A cloddish, harmlessly drecky comedy from the Sandler factory of crude mush.\"\nNathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote: \"Here Comes The Boom seems to have made it from the pitch stage - Kevin James does MMA to save his school or something! - to the big screen without an iota of inspiration, ambition, or personality seeping in at any juncture.\"\nMarc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle wrote: \"\"Here Comes the Bomb\" would've been a more fitting title, but props to Henry Winkler for rising to the occasion and turning in a sweet, idealistic performance in a film that otherwise feels like a tawdry commercial for the UFC and MMA.\"\n\nAwards and nominations\nHere Comes the Boom was chosen as one of ten best films for family audiences by the 21st Annual Movieguide Awards on February 15, 2013.\nPassage 4:\nSau Crore\nSau Crore (lit.\u2009'Hundred crores') is a 1991 Indian film starring, produced and directed by Dev Anand.

Singh Babu Stadium after a practice session.

The role of Syed Modi was played by Raman Kapoor and the politician was played by (Naseeruddin Shah).\n\nPlot\nAfter her husband Raj (Raman Kapoor) is murdered, Kamlesh (Fatima Sheikh) receives a shock and doesn't speak for days. The cause of this is that she indeed witnessed her husband's murder. But who did murder Raj? Was it really the politician Somnath (Naseeruddin Shah) who fell in love with Kamlesh and wanted to marry her? Was it a plot created by Somnath's rival candidate Mohanbhai (Anupam Kher) to win the elections? Or was it Kamlesh herself who wanted to leave Raj and run off with Somnath? It's up to CBI Inspector Kumar (Dev Anand) to find out.\n\nMusic\nLyrics: Suraj Sanim\n\nExternal links\nSau Crore at IMDb\nPassage 5:\nGalate Samsara\nGalate Samsara (transl.\u2009Chaotic family) is a 1977 Indian Kannada language comedy film directed by C.

The movie has played over 60 festivals, winning over 20 awards. It had its American theatrical release on September 12, 2008, on a limited basis.The film is set (and was shot) on the New Jersey shore, mainly in Lavallette.\n\nPlot\nStill reeling from the death of her father, a young girl spends one last summer at the Jersey Shore before heading off to college. But when her plans fall apart, the girl stumbles into a mysterious world of Russian sailors, high-stakes gambling, and unexpected love.\n\nCast\nKim Shaw as Jenny Chambers\nPaul Sorvino as Catch Turner\nDavid Fumero as Benicio Aceveda\nJay O.

That\u2019s the effect Paul Sorvino has in Greetings From the Shore, a watchable-enough summer-at-the-beach tale billed as Gabrielle Berberich\u2019s first feature as writer and producer...until Mr. Sorvino, a real actor and a good one, shows up. He plays a down-on-his-luck fisherman who takes the girl under his wing, and he makes Ms. Shaw and some of the other cast members look like amateurs. The director, Greg Chwerchak (who also gets a writing credit), doesn\u2019t help; he allows several secondary characters to become thudding clich\u00e9s, trampling the delicate story.\"Film critics Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of the web based Spirituality & Practice, discussed the basic theme of the film, \"Jenny's summer teaches her to go with the flow when her life plan is upset. She also learns that the universe is set up in such a felicitous way that when a door closes, a window opens.\"Critic David Hiltbrand liked the film, writing, \"It's a formulaic and familiar plot, the Jersey girl version of The Flamingo Kid. But it unfolds smoothly, thanks to Greg Chwerchak's focused direction. And the water down on Barnegat Inlet Island looks oddly idyllic on film. Greetings From the Shore is well-acted, including by newcomer Shaw, who has an appealing, wide-eyed innocence reminiscent of a young Meg Ryan. This is a two-hankie weeper that doesn't really earn its tears.

Many of her compositions and productions were performed by her husband, comedian Danny Kaye. Fine was a Peabody Award-winner and was nominated for two Academy Awards and two Emmys during her career. She won an Emmy award in 1976 for children's special.\n\nEarly life\nSylvia Fine was born in Brooklyn, New York, the youngest of three children of a Jewish dentist, and raised in East New York. She attended Thomas Jefferson High School and studied music at Brooklyn College, where she wrote the music for the school's alma mater, with lyrics from the poet Robert Friend.\n\nCareer and Danny Kaye\nShe was working as an audition pianist when she met Danny Kaye; both were working on a short-lived Broadway show, The Straw Hat Revue. Fine wrote the lyrics and music for the show. Although the pair had never met before, they discovered some things in common.  They were both born in Brooklyn, and Kaye had once worked for Fine's father, watching his office while the dentist went to lunch. Dr. Fine had fired his future son-in-law for doing woodworking with his dental drills.He proposed on the telephone while working in Florida; Fine was in New York. She made the trip to Fort Lauderdale where they were married on January 3, 1940.She took a direct role in managing her husband's career and wrote many of his songs for him, both in film and recordings.  Those for the film The Court Jester were co-written with Sammy Cahn. She was an associate producer of some of the films. Fine received a Peabody Award in 1980, and during her career she was also nominated for two Oscars and two Emmys. She began working in television production with her husband's 1960s television shows.The New York Times reported, \"In the 1970s, [Fine] embarked on a separate career as a television producer and teacher. She began teaching musical comedy at the University of Southern California in 1971 and at Yale in 1975. She produced and narrated the course as a 90-minute PBS program Musical Comedy Tonight (eventually a three-part series), earning her a Peabody Award in 1979.In 1975 she was executive producer for the television special \"Danny Kaye: Look in at the Metropolitan opera.\"She produced and edited Assignment Children, a UNICEF film that starred her husband. In the last three years of her life, she had been writing a book about her life with Kaye, Fine and Danny, for Knopf Books.\n\nPersonal life\nFine and Kaye had a daughter, Dena (born December 17, 1946). They separated in September 1947, attributing the separation to \"two people working very hard.\" They reunited seven months later, and remained married until his death in 1987.\nIn 1992, her daughter Dena Kaye was quoted in a newspaper article, recalling Fine's advice to her and the influence it had in her life. Both Fine and Kaye were determined not to influence their daughter's choices as she grew up. In a 1954 interview, Kaye stated that \"Whatever she (Dena) wants to be she will be without interference from her mother nor from me.\" Dena grew up to become a journalist.\n\nDeath\nSylvia Fine Kaye died of emphysema at the age of 78 in her Manhattan apartment in 1991. She is buried with her husband at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York.\n\nLegacy\nThe careers of Fine and Kaye are documented in The Danny Kaye and Sylvia Fine Collection at the Library of Congress. The materials preserved in the collection include manuscripts, scores, scripts, photographs, sound recordings, and video clips.\n\nSelected list of Sylvia Fine songs\n\"Anatole of Paris\" from The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947)\n\"The Inspector General\" and \"Happy Times\" (Johnny Green, Sylvia Fine) from The Inspector General (1949)\n\"The Moon Is Blue\" (Herschel Burke Gilbert, Sylvia Fine) from The Moon Is Blue (1953) - Oscar nominee, Best Original Song\n\"Knock on Wood\" from Knock on Wood (1954)\n\"(You'll Never) Outfox the Fox\" (Sammy Cahn, Sylvia Fine) from The Court Jester (1956)\n\"The Five Pennies\" from The Five Pennies (1959) - Oscar nominee, Best Original Song \n\"Lullaby in Ragtime,\" also from The Five Pennies\nPassage 8:\nMarius Weyers\nMarius Weyers (born 3 February 1945, in Johannesburg) is a South African actor.

Although it became a blues standard, music critic Charles Shaar Murray calls it \"the greatest pop song he ever wrote\". \"Boom Boom\" was both an American R&B and pop chart success in 1962 and a UK top-twenty hit in 1992.\nThe song is one of Hooker's most identifiable and enduring songs and \"among the tunes that every band on the [early 1960s UK] R&B circuit simply had to play\".  It has been recorded by numerous blues and other artists, including a 1965 North American hit by the Animals.\n\nRecording and composition\nPrior to recording for Vee-Jay Records, John Lee Hooker was primarily a solo performer or  accompanied by a second guitarist, such as early collaborators Eddie Burns or Eddie Kirkland. However, with Vee-Jay, he usually recorded with a small backing band, as heard on the singles \"Dimples\", \"I Love You Honey\", and \"No Shoes\". Detroit keyboardist Joe Hunter, who had previously worked with Hooker, was again enlisted for the recording session. Hunter brought with him \"the cream of the Motown label's session men, later known as the Funk Brothers\": bassist James Jamerson, drummer Benny Benjamin, plus guitarist Larry Veeder, tenor saxophonist Hank Cosby, and baritone saxophonist Andrew \"Mike\" Terry. They have been described as \"just the right band\" for \"Boom Boom\". Hooker had a unique sense of timing, which demanded \"big-eared sidemen\".The original \"Boom Boom\" is an uptempo (168 beats per minute) blues song, which has been notated in 2/2 time in the key of F.  It has been described as \"about the tightest musical structure of any Hooker composition: its verses sedulously adhere to the twelve-bar format over which Hooker generally rides so roughshod\". The song uses \"a stop-time hook that opens up for one of the genre's most memorable guitar riffs\" and incorporates a middle instrumental section Hooker-style boogie.According to Hooker, he wrote the song during an extended engagement at the Apex Bar in Detroit.\n\nI would never be on time [for the gig]; I always would be late comin' in.  And she [the bartender Willa] kept saying, \"Boom boom \u2013 you late again\".  Every night: \"Boom, boom \u2013 you late again\".  I said \"Hmm, that's a song!\" ... I got it together, the lyrics, rehearsed it, and I played it at the place, and the people went wild.\nAlso included are several wordless phrases, \"how-how-how-how\" and \"hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm\".  \"Boom Boom\" became the Hooker song that is \"the most memorable, the most instantly appealing, and the one which has proved the most adaptable to the needs of other performers\". ZZ Top later used similar lines (\"how-how-how-how\") for their popular \"La Grange\".\n\nReleases and charts\nWhen \"Boom Boom\" was released as a single in April or May 1962, the song became a hit.  It entered the Billboard Hot R&B Sides chart on June 16, 1962, where it spent eight weeks and reached number 16. The song also appeared the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 60, making it one of only two Hooker singles to enter the broader chart. It was included on the 1962 Vee-Jay album Burnin'  as well as many Hooker compilations, including John Lee Hooker: The Ultimate Collection. \nTwo years later, in 1964, the song made a brief appearance on the chart in Walloon Belgium, which at the time did not rank positions.  In 1992, after being featured in a Lee Jeans commercial, the \"Boom Boom\" reached number 16 on the UK Singles Chart. It also appeared on charts in New Zealand (number 24 in 1992) and France (numbers 45 in 1993 and 87 in 2013).Hooker recorded several later versions. Following the success of the Animals' version, Hooker re-recorded the song in 1968 for Stateside Records as the B-side of \"Cry Before I Go\" under the longer title \"Boom Boom Boom\".  He reworked the song as \"Bang Bang Bang Bang\" for his Live at Soledad Prison album, as a South Side Chicago street musician in the film The Blues Brothers (but the song itself is not included in the film soundtrack), and as the title track for his 1992 album Boom Boom with Jimmie Vaughan.\n\nThe Animals version\nEnglish rock band the Animals recorded \"Boom Boom\" for their 1964 UK debut album The Animals.  Their blues-rock rendition generally follows John Lee Hooker's original, although they add \"shake it baby\" as a response to the \"come on and shake\" refrain in the middle section, taken from Hooker's \"Shake It Baby\" (recorded during the 1962 American Folk Blues Festival tour in Europe, where it became a hit in 1963).The Animals' version was released as a single in North America in November 1964 and is included on the Animals' second American album, The Animals on Tour. It reached number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 14 on the Canadian RPM Top 40&5 singles chart. The song also appeared on the unranked chart in Wallonia.Cash Box described it as \"a rousing salute to the apple of a guy's eye\" that's \"exciting, funky-styled\" and \"a great swinger.\"Over the years, several versions of \"Boom Boom\" have been recorded by various Animals reunion lineups as well as by former members Eric Burdon and Alan Price. In 2012, the original 1964 version was used in the film Skyfall.\n\nBig Head Todd and the Monsters version\nAmerican rock group Big Head Todd and the Monsters recorded \"Boom Boom\" for their album Beautiful World (1997). Group bassist Rob Squires described the recording session: \"Hooker has just this incredible presence. He walked into the room and literally everyone was intimidated including our producer and the people who work in the studio.\"  Beginning with the television series debut of NCIS: New Orleans in 2014, a portion of Big Head Todd's version has been used as the opening theme.\n\nRecognition and legacy\nIn 1995, John Lee Hooker's \"Boom Boom\" was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of \"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\".  It was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 2009 in the \"Classics of Blues Recording\" category. A Detroit Free Press poll in 2016 ranked the song at number 37 in \"Detroit's 100 Greatest Songs\". Rolling Stone magazine ranked Hooker's version at number 463 on its 2021 list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", down from number 220 on its 2004 list.\nPassage 11:\nBeethoven (TV series)\nBeethoven is a 1994  American Saturday morning cartoon television series loosely based on the 1992 motion picture of the same name.  The series was produced by Northern Lights Entertainment and Universal Cartoon Studios, and aired for one season on CBS Saturday Mornings, with 13 episodes with two 10 minute segments produced. Dean Jones, who played Dr. Varnick in the film, voiced the role of George Newton; Nicholle Tom, who played teenage daughter Ryce in the film and Beethoven's 2nd, was the only cast member from the films to reprise her role in the series.\n\nPremise\nThe Newton family love Beethoven, their St. Bernard dog. But the father, George, has his moments with Beethoven, who gets in different mishaps time after time. When not with the Newton family, Beethoven spends time with three other dogs, Sparky (the stray from the first film), Ginger, and Caesar.\nUnlike the film, Beethoven has a speaking voice, at least among the other animals. The same plot was used in another animated series, Free Willy, where the main character also could talk.\n\nCast\nAdditional voices\nCrew\nPaul Germain - Producer, Story Editor and Voice Director\n\nEpisodes\nHome release\nUniversal and Goodtimes released episodes of the show on VHS. In July 2020, the series became available on the Peacock streaming service.\nPassage 12:\nSonny & Cher\nSonny & Cher were an American pop and entertainment duo in the 1960s and 1970s, made up of spouses Sonny Bono and Cher. The couple started their career in the mid-1960s as R&B backing singers for record producer Phil Spector.\nThe pair first achieved fame with two hit songs in 1965, \"Baby Don't Go\" and \"I Got You Babe\". Signing with Atco/Atlantic Records, they released three studio albums in the late 1960s, as well as the soundtrack recordings for two unsuccessful movies, Good Times and Chastity, with Cher contributing vocals to one cut, \"Chastity's Song (Band of Thieves)\". In 1972, after three years of silence, the couple returned to the studio and released two other albums under the MCA/Kapp Records label.\nIn the 1970s, they also positioned themselves as media personalities with two top ten TV shows in the US, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour and The Sonny & Cher Show. The couple's career as a duo ended in 1975 following their divorce. In the decade they spent together, Sonny and Cher were nominated for two Grammy Awards and sold over 40 million records worldwide. Rolling Stone ranked them No. 18 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.Performing under her first name, Cher went on to a highly successful career as a solo singer and actress, while Sonny Bono was eventually elected to Congress as a Republican U.S. Representative from California. The two performers were inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1998, following Sonny's death in a skiing accident.\n\nCareer\n1962\u20131964: The origin\nCherilyn Sarkisian first met Salvatore Bono in a Los Angeles coffee shop in November 1962, when she was sixteen. Eleven years her senior, Bono was working for record producer Phil Spector at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood. The two became best friends, eventual lovers, and were supposedly married in 1964, but Bono says in his autobiography that it was not an official marriage. They were legally wed after their only child, Chaz, was born. Through Bono, Cher started as a session singer, and sang backup on several of Spector's classic recordings, including \"Be My Baby\" by the Ronettes, \"You've Lost That Loving Feeling\" by The Righteous Brothers and Darlene Love's \"A Fine, Fine Boy\". In Darlene Love's recording, the listener can clearly hear Cher and Sonny close to the mic (along with Love, who recorded her own backing vocals).\n\n1965\u20131966: Career development\nWith Bono continuing to write, arrange and produce the songs, the couple's first incarnation was as the duo \"Caesar and Cleo\". They released some singles in 1964, including \"The Letter\", with Vault Records, and \"The Letter\", \"Do You Wanna Dance\" and \"Love Is Strange\", with Reprise Records.In September 1964, they released \"Baby Don't Go\" under the name of Sonny & Cher, which became their first regional hit. The song was later included on the 1965 Reprise compilation Baby Don't Go \u2013 Sonny & Cher and Friends, which also included songs from artists such as Bill Medley, The Lettermen and The Blendells.The duo released their first album Look at Us in the summer of 1965. The album contained the number one single \"I Got You Babe\". Look at Us peaked at number two on the Billboard chart for eight weeks in the later part of 1965.Sonny & Cher made their first promotional tour of Britain in the first two weeks of August 1965. The tour was organized and overseen by Larry Page, co-manager of the English rock band the Kinks, who met Cher a month earlier while she finished recording her debut album and while the Kinks toured America. Page and the Kinks' publicist Brian Sommerville quickly signed to be Sonny & Cher's European business manager and British publicist, respectively. During their two weeks in Britain, the duo primarily appeared on British television and radio, but they also performed at the 100 Club in central London on August 5.The couple appeared on many of the top television shows of the era including The Ed Sullivan Show, American Bandstand, Where The Action Is, Hollywood A Go-Go, Hollywood Palace, Hullabaloo, Beat Club, Shindig!, Ready Steady Go! and Top of the Pops. They also appeared as themselves in the film Wild on the Beach, singing \"It's Gonna Rain\". On their first album Bono also displayed his political interest long before running for Congress in the lyrics of the song, \"The Revolution Kind\".\nAs the followup to the success of Look at Us, they released their second studio album in April 1966, The Wondrous World of Sonny & Ch\u00e9r, which peaked at number 34. The two dressed in animal skins with Bono wearing knee high caveman boots and Cher going barefoot.During 1965, five of their songs were in US Billboard Top 20, a record passed only by Elvis Presley and behind famous artists like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and others. Periodic solo releases by Cher continued during this period, including major successes with \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\", and Burt Bacharach & Hal David's theme from \"Alfie\" (as heard in the motion picture Alfie, as well as a single release), both in 1966. Because they sided with the young people being harassed on the Sunset Strip during the Sunset Strip curfew riots; they were removed from their promised position of honor in the Tournament of Roses Parade in January 1967.\n\n1967\u20131969: Career woes\nIn 1967, Sonny and Cher released their third album, In Case You're In Love. It peaked at number 45 in the U.S. charts. It contained two hit singles, both written by Bono, \"The Beat Goes On\" (No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100) and \"Little Man\" (No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100).\nIn an attempt to capitalize on the duo's initial success, Bono speedily arranged a film project for the duo to star in, but the 1967 feature, Good Times, was a major bomb, despite the efforts of fledgling director William Friedkin and co-star George Sanders. After Good Times flopped in 1968, Columbia Pictures immediately sold rights to their intended follow-up film Speedway to MGM. The couple were replaced by Elvis Presley and Nancy Sinatra. In 1969, another film, Chastity, starring Cher, written and produced by Sonny, was also a commercial bomb.Sonny and Cher's career had stalled by 1968 as album sales quickly dried up. Their gentle, easy-listening pop sound and drug-free life had become unpopular in an era increasingly consumed with the psychedelic rock of the evolving landscape of American pop culture during the late 1960s.\nBono decided to forge ahead, carving a new career for the duo in Las Vegas resorts, where they sharpened their public persona with Cher as the wise-cracking, glamorous singer, and Bono as the good-natured recipient of her insults. In reality, Bono controlled every aspect of their act, from the musical arrangements to the joke-writing. While success was slow to come, their luck improved when network TV talent scouts attended a show, noting their potential appeal for a variety series.\nSonny and Cher also welcomed their first child, Chastity (named after Cher's movie), born on March 4, 1969.\n\n1970\u20131977: TV success and divorce\nIn 1970, Sonny and Cher starred in their first television special, The Nitty Gritty Hour, a mixture of slapstick comedy, skits, and live music. The appearance was a critical success, which led to numerous guest spots on other television shows. They also appeared in The New Scooby-Doo Movies as guest stars.\nSonny and Cher caught the eye of CBS head of programming Fred Silverman while guest-hosting The Merv Griffin Show, and Silverman offered the duo their own variety show. The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour debuted in 1971 as a summer replacement series. The show returned to prime time later that year and was an immediate hit, quickly reaching the Top 10. The show received 15 Emmy Award nominations during its run, winning one for direction, throughout its initial four seasons on CBS. The duo also revived their recording career, releasing the album All I Ever Need Is You, and charting two more top ten hits: \"All I Ever Need Is You\", and \"A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done\" in 1972.Sonny and Cher's dialogues were patterned after the successful nightclub routines of Louis Prima and Keely Smith: the happy-go-lucky husband squelched by a tart remark from the unamused wife. The show featured a stock company of zany comedians, including Teri Garr, Freeman King, Ted Ziegler, Billy Van and Murray Langston (later The Unknown Comic on The Gong Show). One sketch satirizing CBS's detective show Cannon and its portly star William Conrad was so successful that Sonny and Cher staged several follow-ups, with Tony Curtis as \"Detective Fat\". Everybody in these sketches wore wide-waisted \"fat suits\" (similar to hoop skirts), so Detective Fat and his clients and his suspects would spend most of the time bumping each other and bouncing across the crowded room.\nBy the third season of the Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour (1974), the marriage of Sonny and Cher was falling apart; the duo separated later that year. The show imploded, while still rating in the top 10. What followed was a very public divorce (finalized on June 26, 1975). Cher won a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance By an Actress in a Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy for The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour in 1974.\n\nBono launched his own show, The Sonny Comedy Revue, in the fall of 1974, retaining the \"Sonny and Cher\" troupe of comedians and writers. Cher also announced plans to star in a new variety series of her own. Critics predicted that Bono would be the big winner with a solo comedy vehicle, and held little hope for Cher's more musical showcase. After only six weeks, however, Bono's show was abruptly canceled.The Cher show debuted as an elaborate, all-star television special on February 16, 1975, featuring Flip Wilson, Bette Midler, and special guest Elton John. Cloris Leachman and Jack Albertson both won Emmy Awards for their appearances as guest-stars a few weeks later, and the series received four additional Emmy nominations that year. The first season ranked in the Top 25 of the year-end ratings.\nAs a result of the divorce, Sonny and Cher went their separate ways until Cher attended the opening of one of Bono's restaurants in something of a reconciliation. The Sonny & Cher Show returned in 1976, even though they were no longer married (the duo \"reunited\" with a humorous handshake). After struggling with low ratings through 1977, Sonny and Cher finally parted ways for good. In 1976, Mego Toys also released a line of toys and dolls, in the likeness of Sonny & Cher. The release of these fashion dolls coincided with the popularity of The Sonny & Cher Show.\n\n1978\u20131999: After Sonny and Cher\nSonny Bono went on to an acting career and later entered politics, eventually becoming a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Cher went on to become a Grammy Award-winning solo singer and an Academy Award-winning actress.\nThe couple made two surprise impromptu reunion performances: the first on The Mike Douglas Show in the spring of 1979, singing a medley of \"United We Stand\" and \"Without You\", and the second on November 13, 1987, on Late Night with David Letterman where they performed their hit song \"I Got You Babe\"; it turned out to be the last time the two would perform together.In early 1999, And the Beat Goes On: The Sonny and Cher Story, directed by David Burton Morris and starring Jay Underwood and Renee Faia, was broadcast on ABC. The TV movie was based on the autobiography of Bono, and focuses on the relationship between the couple during the early 1960s to their divorce in the mid 1970s. This movie was also nominated for two Emmy Awards.\n\nBono's death, music copyright\nOn January 5, 1998, Bono died of injuries from hitting a tree while skiing at Heavenly Ski Resort in Lake Tahoe. He was 62 years old. Bono's death came just days after Michael Kennedy died in a similar accident. Bono's widow, Mary, was selected to fill the remainder of his congressional term, and was re-elected in her own right, serving until she was defeated for re-election in 2012. She continues to champion many of her late husband's causes, including the ongoing fight as how to best save the Salton Sea.\nThe funeral, unbeknownst to Cher, was broadcast live on CNN. She gave a tearful eulogy, after which the attendees sang the song \"The Beat Goes On\". In front of millions, Cher tearfully and effusively praised Bono, calling him \"the most unforgettable character I've ever met\". His final resting place is Desert Memorial Park in nearby Cathedral City, California, the same cemetery in which Frank Sinatra was laid to rest later that same year. The epitaph on Bono's headstone reads: \"And The Beat Goes On\".In 1998, Sonny and Cher received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television. Cher appeared at the event with Mary Bono, who accepted the award on behalf of her late husband. Cher paid tribute to Bono in the CBS special Sonny and Me: Cher Remembers, calling her grief \"something I never plan to get over\". During the same year, Cher also released her twenty-second album Believe that was highly influenced by Bono's death, and in the booklet Cher wrote \"In memory of Son\".When Cher and Bono divorced, they agreed to split revenue from the songs recorded together. When Bono died, one-third of his interest passed to wife Mary Bono, and one-sixth interests were split amongst his children. Cher sued UMG in 2009, claiming she and Bono's heirs were owed $5,000,000 in \"hidden\" royalties.\n\nLegacy and achievements\nAuthor Joseph Murrells described Sonny & Cher as \"part of the leading exponents of the rock-folk-message type of song, a hybrid combining the beat and instrumentation of rock music with folk lyrics and often lyrics of protest.\"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour received numerous Emmy nominations; Director Art Fisher won for Outstanding Directing for a Variety Series in 1972.

The film stars Bobby Deol, Upen Patel, Celina Jaitly and Kangana Ranaut in the lead. It released on April 6, 2007.\nShakalaka Boom Boom is based on conflicts and the power game involved in the functioning of the music industry. The film is loosely based on the Academy Award winning film Amadeus. The film was partly shot in South Africa.\n\nPlot\nShakalaka Boom Boom follows the tale of a jealous, selfish and greedy music artist, Ayan Joshi aka AJ (Bobby Deol). AJ is one of the finest music artists in the industry and is currently under a stop since he can't think of a new project. AJ is in love with the hot and sexy Ruhi (Kangana Ranaut) and hopes to tell her how he feels. However, a wannabe singer, Reggie (Upen Patel) appears who falls in love with Ruhi and woos her before AJ can. \nTherefore, AJ swears to destroy Reggie's career and hence comes into Reggie's life as his friend. Getting him drunk, getting him smoking, is all that AJ has been doing to Reggie, and Reggie even loses control and passes out. One day, AJ finds out all Reggie's secrets and gets him so drunk that he has liver-fail. While Reggie was in the state of dying, AJ takes all his music-notes and beats and flees from the place. Then Ruhi shows up and takes him to the hospital. He is placed into the operation section due to liver failure, and then Ruhi plans to destroy AJ's career just like he did to Reggie.\nThough Ruhi does not know that AJ isn't alone, he also has his hidden agenda with Reggie's ex-girlfriend Sheena (Celina Jaitly) who is now a bigshot due to AJ. AJ and Sheena together publish Reggie's music as their own, and it goes onto becoming a big hit. At the music-signing, Ruhi gets her gun out, though it doesn't seem to work. She seems that's it, though Karma has a different plan in mind. Due to her gun not working, she leaves and as she leaves, a disco ball randomly falls on top of AJ's head. He is placed into the hospital, and the doctors declare him \"deaf\". The ending shows him going to hell, and Reggie waking up to a better life, as he and Ruhi have now proved that the music is really his.\n\nCast\nBobby Deol as A.J.\nUpen Patel as Reggie\nCelina Jaitly as Sheena\nKangana Ranaut as Ruhi\nAsrani as Yogra\nDalip Tahil as Kumar\nAnupam Kher as Reggie's Father\nGovind Namdev as Guru\nVivek Vaswani as Vidyacharan Shukla\nSeema Rahmani as Seema\n\nSoundtrack\nAll songs  are composed by Himesh Reshammiya and lyrics are penned by Sameer.\n\nReception\nCritical reception\nShakalaka Boom Boom attracted negative reviews from top critics of India.

    "Passage 1:\nJames Chadwick\nSir James Chadwick,  (20 October 1891 \u2013 24 July 1974) was a British physicist who was awarded the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the neutron in 1932. In 1941, he wrote the final draft of the MAUD Report, which inspired the U.S. government to begin serious atom bomb research efforts. He was the head of the British team that worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. He was knighted in Britain in 1945 for his achievements in physics.\nChadwick graduated from the Victoria University of Manchester in 1911, where he studied under Ernest Rutherford (known as the \"father of nuclear physics\"). At Manchester, he continued to study under Rutherford until he was awarded his MSc in 1913. The same year, Chadwick was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851. He elected to study beta radiation under Hans Geiger in Berlin. Using Geiger's recently developed Geiger counter, Chadwick was able to demonstrate that beta radiation produced a continuous spectrum, and not discrete lines as had been thought. Still in Germany when World War I broke out in Europe, he spent the next four years in the Ruhleben internment camp.\nAfter the war, Chadwick followed Rutherford to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where Chadwick earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree under Rutherford's supervision from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in June 1921. He was Rutherford's assistant director of research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. Chadwick followed his discovery of the neutron by measuring its mass. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a cyclotron, made it an important centre for the study of nuclear physics.\nDuring the Second World War, Chadwick carried out research as part of the Tube Alloys project to build an atom bomb, while his Manchester lab and environs were harassed by Luftwaffe bombing. When the Quebec Agreement merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became part of the British Mission, and worked at the Los Alamos Laboratory and in Washington, D.C. He surprised everyone by earning the almost-complete trust of project director Leslie R. Groves, Jr. For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. In July 1945, he viewed the Trinity nuclear test. After this, he served as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Uncomfortable with the trend toward Big Science, he became the Master of Gonville and Caius College in 1948. He retired in 1959.\n\nEducation and early life\nJames Chadwick was born in Bollington, Cheshire, on 20 October 1891, the first child of John Joseph Chadwick, a cotton spinner, and Anne Mary Knowles, a domestic servant. He was named James after his paternal grandfather. In 1895, his parents moved to Manchester, leaving him in the care of his maternal grandparents. He went to Bollington Cross Primary School, and was offered a scholarship to Manchester Grammar School, which his family had to turn down as they could not afford the small fees that still had to be paid. Instead he attended the Central Grammar School for Boys in Manchester, rejoining his parents there. He now had two younger brothers, Harry and Hubert; a sister had died in infancy. At the age of 16, he sat two examinations for university scholarships, and won both of them.Chadwick chose to attend Victoria University of Manchester, which he entered in 1908. He meant to study mathematics, but enrolled in physics by mistake. Like most students, he lived at home, walking the 4 miles (6.4 km) to the university and back each day. At the end of his first year, he was awarded a Heginbottom Scholarship to study physics. The physics department was headed by Ernest Rutherford, who assigned research projects to final-year students, and he instructed Chadwick to devise a means of comparing the amount of radioactive energy of two different sources. The idea was that they could be measured in terms of the activity of 1 gram (0.035 oz) of radium, a unit of measurement which would become known as the curie. Rutherford's suggested approach was unworkable\u2014something Chadwick knew but was afraid to tell Rutherford\u2014so Chadwick pressed on, and eventually devised the required method. The results became Chadwick's first paper, which, co-authored with Rutherford, was published in 1912. He graduated with first class honours in 1911.Having devised a means of measuring gamma radiation, Chadwick proceeded to measure the absorption of gamma rays by various gases and liquids. This time the resulting paper was published under his name alone. He was awarded his Master of Science (MSc) degree in 1912, and was appointed a Beyer Fellow. The following year he was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship, which allowed him to study and research at a university in continental Europe. He elected to go to the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt in Berlin in 1913, to study beta radiation under Hans Geiger. Using Geiger's recently developed Geiger counter, which provided more accuracy than the earlier photographic techniques, he was able to demonstrate that beta radiation did not produce discrete lines, as has been previously thought, but rather a continuous spectrum with peaks in certain regions. On a visit to Geiger's laboratory, Albert Einstein told Chadwick that: \"I can explain either of these things, but I can't explain them both at the same time.\" The continuous spectrum would remain an unexplained phenomenon for many years.Chadwick was still in Germany at the start of the First World War, and was interned in the Ruhleben internment camp near Berlin, where he was allowed to set up a laboratory in the stables and conduct scientific experiments using improvised materials such as radioactive toothpaste. With the help of Charles Drummond Ellis, he worked on the ionisation of phosphorus, and the photochemical reaction of carbon monoxide and chlorine. He was released after the Armistice with Germany came into effect in November 1918, and returned to his parents' home in Manchester, where he wrote up his findings over the previous four years for the 1851 Exhibition commissioners.Rutherford gave Chadwick a part-time teaching position at Manchester, allowing him to continue research. He looked at the nuclear charge of platinum, silver, and copper, and experimentally found that this was the same as the atomic number within an error of less than 1.5 per cent. In April 1919, Rutherford became director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and Chadwick joined him there a few months later. Chadwick was awarded a Clerk-Maxwell studentship in 1920, and enrolled as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The first half of his thesis was his work with atomic numbers. In the second, he looked at the forces inside the nucleus. His degree was awarded in June 1921. In November, he became a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College.\n\nResearcher\nCambridge\nChadwick's Clerk-Maxwell studentship expired in 1923, and he was succeeded by the Russian physicist Pyotr Kapitza. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir William McCormick arranged for Chadwick to become Rutherford's assistant director of research. In this role, Chadwick helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over the next few years these would include John Cockcroft, Norman Feather and Mark Oliphant, who would become firm friends with Chadwick. As many students had no idea what they wanted to research, Rutherford and Chadwick would suggest topics. Chadwick edited all the papers produced by the laboratory.\n\nIn 1925, Chadwick met Aileen Stewart-Brown, the daughter of a Liverpool stockbroker. The two were married in August 1925, with Kapitza as Best Man. The couple had twin daughters, Joanna and Judith, who were born in February 1927.In his research, Chadwick continued to probe the nucleus. In 1925, the concept of spin had allowed physicists to explain the Zeeman effect, but it also created unexplained anomalies. At the time it was believed that the nucleus consisted of protons and electrons, so nitrogen's nucleus, for example, with a mass number of 14, was assumed to contain 14 protons and 7 electrons. This gave it the right mass and charge, but the wrong spin.At a conference at Cambridge on beta particles and gamma rays in 1928, Chadwick met Geiger again. Geiger had brought with him a new model of his Geiger counter, which had been improved by his post-doctoral student Walther M\u00fcller. Chadwick had not used one since the war, and the new Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller counter was potentially a major improvement over the scintillation techniques then in use at Cambridge, which relied on the human eye for observation. The major drawback with it was that it detected alpha, beta and gamma radiation, and radium, which the Cavendish laboratory normally used in its experiments, emitted all three, and was therefore unsuitable for what Chadwick had in mind. However, polonium is an alpha emitter, and Lise Meitner sent Chadwick about 2 millicuries (about 0.5 \u03bcg) from Germany.In Germany, Walther Bothe and his student Herbert Becker had used polonium to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this was evidence of something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from paraffin wax using polonium and beryllium as a source for what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.\n\nChadwick dropped all his other responsibilities to concentrate on proving the existence of the neutron, assisted by Feather and frequently working late at night. He devised a simple apparatus that consisted of a cylinder containing a polonium source and beryllium target. The resulting radiation could then be directed at a material such as paraffin wax; the displaced particles, which were protons, would go into a small ionisation chamber where they could be detected with an oscilloscope.\nIn February 1932, after only about two weeks of experimentation with neutrons, Chadwick sent a letter to Nature titled \"Possible Existence of a Neutron\". He communicated his findings in detail in an article sent to Proceedings of the Royal Society A titled \"The Existence of a Neutron\" in May. His discovery of the neutron was a milestone in understanding the nucleus. Reading Chadwick's paper, Robert Bacher and Edward Condon realised that anomalies in the then-current theory, like the spin of nitrogen, would be resolved if the neutron has a spin of 1/2 and that a nitrogen nucleus consisted of seven protons and seven neutrons.The theoretical physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg considered whether the neutron could be a fundamental nuclear particle like the proton and electron, rather than a proton\u2013electron pair.  Heisenberg showed that the neutron was best described as a new nuclear particle, but its exact nature remained unclear.  In his 1933 Bakerian Lecture, Chadwick estimated that a neutron had a mass of about 1.0067 u. Since a proton and an electron had a combined mass of 1.0078 u, this implied the neutron as a proton\u2013electron composite had a binding energy of about 2 MeV, which sounded reasonable, although it was hard to understand how a particle with so little binding energy could be stable.  Estimating such a small mass difference required challenging precise measurements, however, and several conflicting results were obtained in 1933\u20134.  By bombarding boron with alpha particles, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie obtained a large value for the mass of a neutron, but Ernest Lawrence's team at the University of California produced a small one.  Then Maurice Goldhaber, a refugee from Nazi Germany and a graduate student at the Cavendish Laboratory, suggested to Chadwick that deuterons could be photodisintegrated by the 2.6 MeV gamma rays of 208Tl (then known as thorium C\"):\n\nAn accurate value for the mass of the neutron could be determined from this process. Chadwick and Goldhaber tried this and found that it worked.  They measured the kinetic energy of the proton produced as 1.05 MeV, leaving the mass of the neutron as the unknown in the equation.  Chadwick and Goldhaber calculated that it was either 1.0084 or 1.0090 atomic units, depending on the values used for the masses of the proton and deuteron.  (The modern accepted value for the mass of the neutron is 1.00866 u.) The mass of the neutron was too large to be a proton\u2013electron pair.For his discovery of the neutron, Chadwick was awarded the Hughes Medal by the Royal Society in 1932, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935, the Copley Medal in 1950 and the Franklin Medal in 1951. His discovery of the neutron made it possible to produce elements heavier than uranium in the laboratory by the capture of slow neutrons followed by beta decay. Unlike the positively charged alpha particles, which are repelled by the electrical forces present in the nuclei of other atoms, neutrons do not need to overcome any Coulomb barrier, and can therefore penetrate and enter the nuclei of even the heaviest elements such as uranium. This inspired Enrico Fermi to investigate the nuclear reactions brought about by collisions of nuclei with slow neutrons, work for which Fermi would receive the Nobel Prize in 1938.Wolfgang Pauli proposed another kind of particle on 4 December 1930 in order to explain the continuous spectrum of beta radiation that Chadwick had reported in 1914. Since not all of the energy of beta radiation could be accounted for, the law of conservation of energy appeared to be violated, but Pauli argued that this could be redressed if another, undiscovered, particle was involved. Pauli also called this particle a neutron, but it was clearly not the same particle as Chadwick's neutron. Fermi renamed it the neutrino, Italian for \"little neutron\". In 1934, Fermi proposed his theory of beta decay which explained that the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton, an electron, and a neutrino.  The neutrino could account for the missing energy, but a particle with little mass and no electric charge was difficult to observe. Rudolf Peierls and Hans Bethe calculated that neutrinos could easily pass through the Earth, so the chances of detecting them were slim. Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan would confirm the neutrino on 14 June 1956 by placing a detector within a large antineutrino flux from a nearby nuclear reactor.\n\nLiverpool\nWith the onset of the Great Depression in the United Kingdom, the government became more parsimonious with funding for science. At the same time, Lawrence's recent invention, the cyclotron, promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics, and Chadwick felt that the Cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one. He therefore chafed under Rutherford, who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large, expensive equipment, and turned down the request for a cyclotron.\n\nChadwick was himself a critic of Big Science in general, and Lawrence in particular, whose approach he considered careless and focused on technology at the expense of science. When Lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the Solvay Conference in 1933, Chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment. While Lawrence rechecked his results at Berkeley only to find that Chadwick was correct, Rutherford and Oliphant conducted an investigation at the Cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, thereby causing the effect that Lawrence had observed. This was another major discovery, but the Oliphant-Rutherford particle accelerator was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment.In March 1935, Chadwick received an offer of the Lyon Jones Chair of physics at the University of Liverpool, in his wife's home town, to succeed Lionel Wilberforce. The laboratory was so antiquated that it still ran on direct current electricity, but Chadwick seized the opportunity, assuming the chair on 1 October 1935. The university's prestige was soon bolstered by Chadwick's Nobel Prize, which was announced in November 1935. His medal was sold at auction in 2014 for $329,000.Chadwick set about acquiring a cyclotron for Liverpool. He started by spending \u00a3700 to refurbish the antiquated laboratories at Liverpool, so some components could be made in-house. He was able to persuade the university to provide \u00a32,000 and obtained a grant for another \u00a32,000 from the Royal Society. To build his cyclotron, Chadwick brought in two young experts, Bernard Kinsey and Harold Walke, who had worked with Lawrence at the University of California. A local cable manufacturer donated the copper conductor for the coils. The cyclotron's 50-ton magnet was manufactured in Trafford Park by Metropolitan-Vickers, which also made the vacuum chamber. The cyclotron was completely installed and running in July 1939. The total cost of \u00a35,184 was more than Chadwick had received from the University and the Royal Society, so Chadwick paid the rest from his 159,917 kr (\u00a38,243) Nobel Prize money.At Liverpool the Medicine and Science faculties worked together closely. Chadwick was automatically a committee member of both faculties, and in 1938 he was appointed to a commission headed by Lord Derby to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in Liverpool. Chadwick anticipated that neutrons and radioactive isotopes produced with the 37-inch cyclotron could be used to study biochemical processes, and might become a weapon in the fight against cancer.\n\nSecond World War\nTube Alloys and the MAUD Report\nIn Germany, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann bombarded uranium with neutrons, and noted that barium, a lighter element, was among the products produced. Hitherto, only the same or heavier elements had been produced by the process. In January 1939, Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch astounded the physics community with a paper that explained this result. They theorised that uranium atoms bombarded with neutrons can break into two roughly equal fragments, a process they called fission. They calculated that this would result in the release of about 200 MeV, implying an energy release orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions, and Frisch confirmed their theory experimentally. It was soon noted by Hahn that if neutrons were released during fission, then a chain reaction was possible. French scientists, Pierre Joliot, Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski, soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission. In a paper co-authored with the American physicist John Wheeler, Bohr theorised that fission was more likely to occur in the uranium-235 isotope, which made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium.\n\nChadwick did not believe that there was any likelihood of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.In October 1939, Chadwick received a letter from Sir Edward Appleton, the Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, asking for his opinion on the feasibility of an atom bomb. Chadwick responded cautiously. He did not dismiss the possibility, but carefully went over the many theoretical and practical difficulties involved. Chadwick decided to investigate the properties of uranium oxide further with Rotblat. In March 1940, Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls at the University of Birmingham re-examined the theoretical issues involved in a paper that became known as the Frisch\u2013Peierls memorandum. Instead of looking at unenriched uranium oxide, they considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that not only could a chain reaction occur, but that it might require as little as 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235, and unleash the energy of tons of dynamite.\n\nA special subcommittee of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW), known as the MAUD Committee, was created to investigate the matter further. It was chaired by Sir George Thomson and its original membership included Chadwick, along with Mark Oliphant, John Cockcroft and Philip Moon. While other teams investigated uranium enrichment techniques, Chadwick's team at Liverpool concentrated on determining the nuclear cross section of uranium-235. By April 1941, it had been experimentally confirmed that the critical mass of uranium-235 might be 8 kilograms (18 lb) or less. His research into such matters was complicated by all-but-incessant Luftwaffe bombings of the environs of his Liverpool lab; the windows were blown out so often that they were replaced by cardboard.In July 1941, Chadwick was chosen to write the final draft of the MAUD Report, which, when presented by Vannevar Bush to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in October 1941, inspired the U.S. government to pour millions of dollars into the pursuit of an atom bomb. When George B. Pegram and Harold Urey visited Britain to see how the project, now known as Tube Alloys, was going, Chadwick was able to tell them: \"I wish I could tell you that the bomb is not going to work, but I am 90 per cent sure that it will.\"In a recent book about the Bomb project, Graham Farmelo wrote that \"Chadwick did more than any other scientist to give Churchill the Bomb. ... Chadwick was tested almost to the breaking point.\" So worried that he could not sleep, Chadwick resorted to sleeping pills, which he continued to take for most of his remaining years. Chadwick later said that he realised that \"a nuclear bomb was not only possible\u2014it was inevitable. Sooner or later these ideas could not be peculiar to us. Everybody would think about them before long, and some country would put them into action\". Sir Hermann Bondi suggested that it was fortunate that Chadwick, not Rutherford, was the doyen of UK physics at the time, as the latter's prestige might otherwise have overpowered Chadwick's interest in \"looking forward\" to the Bomb's prospects.\n\nManhattan Project\nOwing to the danger from aerial bombardment, the Chadwicks sent their twins to Canada as part of a government evacuation scheme. Chadwick was reluctant to move Tube Alloys there, believing that the United Kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant. The enormous scope of the effort became more apparent in 1942: even a pilot separation plant would cost over \u00a31 million and strain Britain's resources, to say nothing of a full-scale plant, which was estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of \u00a325 million. It would have to be built in America. At the same time that the British became convinced that a joint project was necessary, the progress of the American Manhattan Project was such that British cooperation seemed less essential, although the Americans were still eager to utilise Chadwick's talents.The matter of cooperation had to be taken up at the highest level. In September 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and President Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which reinstated cooperation between Britain, the United States and Canada. Chadwick, Oliphant, Peierls and Simon were summoned to the United States by the director of Tube Alloys, Sir Wallace Akers, to work with the Manhattan Project. The Quebec Agreement established a new Combined Policy Committee to direct the joint project. The Americans disliked Akers, so Chadwick was appointed technical advisor to the Combined Policy Committee, and the head of the British Mission.Leaving Rotblat in charge in Liverpool, Chadwick began a tour of the Manhattan Project facilities in November 1943, except for the Hanford Site where plutonium was produced, which he was not allowed to see. He became the only man apart from Groves and his second in command to have access to all the American research and production facilities for the uranium bomb. Observing the work on the K-25 gaseous diffusion facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Chadwick realised how wrong he had been about building the plant in wartime Britain. The enormous structure could never have been concealed from the Luftwaffe. In early 1944, he moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico, with his wife and their twins, who now spoke with Canadian accents. For security reasons, he was given the cover name of James Chaffee.\n\nChadwick accepted that the Americans did not need British help, but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with the director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., he attempted to do everything he could to support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project's success.Although he had more knowledge of the project than anyone else from Britain, Chadwick had no access to the Hanford site. Lord Portal was offered a tour of Hanford in 1946. \"This was the only plant to which Chadwick had been denied access in wartime, and now he asked Groves if he could accompany Portal. Groves replied that he could, but if he did then 'Portal will not see very much'.\" For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. He considered this to be a recognition of the work of the whole Tube Alloys project.By early 1945, Chadwick was spending most of his time in Washington, D.C., and his family relocated from Los Alamos to a house on Washington's Dupont Circle in April 1945. He was present at the meeting of the Combined Policy Committee on 4 July when Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson gave Britain's agreement to use the atom bomb against Japan, and at the Trinity nuclear test on 16 July, when the first atom bomb was detonated. Inside its pit was a polonium-beryllium modulated neutron initiator, a development of the technique that Chadwick had used to discover the neutron over a decade before. William L. Laurence, The New York Times reporter attached to the Manhattan Project, wrote that \"never before in history had any man lived to see his own discovery materialize itself with such telling effect on the destiny of man.\"\n\nLater life\nShortly after the war ended, Chadwick was appointed to the Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy (ACAE). He was also appointed as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. He clashed with fellow ACAE member Patrick Blackett, who disagreed with Chadwick's conviction that Britain needed to acquire its own nuclear weapons; but it was Chadwick's position that was ultimately adopted. He returned to Britain in 1946, to find a country still beset by wartime rationing and shortages.At this time, Sir James Mountford, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Liverpool, wrote in his diary \"he had never seen a man 'so physically, mentally and spiritually tired\" as Chadwick, for he \"had plumbed such depths of moral decision as more fortunate men are never called upon even to peer into ... [and suffered] ... almost insupportable agonies of responsibility arising from his scientific work'.\"In 1948, Chadwick accepted an offer to become the Master of Gonville and Caius College. The job was prestigious but ill-defined; the Master was the titular head of the College, but authority actually resided in a council of 13 fellows, of whom one was the Master. As Master, Chadwick strove to improve the academic reputation of the college. He increased the number of research fellowships from 31 to 49, and sought to bring talent into the college. This involved controversial decisions, such as hiring in 1951 the Chinese biochemist Tien-chin Tsao and the Hungarian-born economist Peter Bauer. In what became known as the Peasants' Revolt, fellows led by Patrick Hadley voted an old friend of Chadwick's off the council and replaced him with Bauer. More friends of Chadwick's were removed over the following years, and he retired in November 1958. It was during his mastership that Francis Crick, a PhD student at Gonville and Caius College, and James Watson discovered the structure of DNA.Over the years, Chadwick received many honours, including the Medal for Merit from the United States, and the Pour le M\u00e9rite from Germany. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1927. He became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1946 and an International member of the American Philosophical Society in 1948. He was made a Companion of Honour in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1970 for \"services to science\", and went to Buckingham Palace for the investiture ceremony. He became more frail, and seldom left his flat, although he travelled to Liverpool for celebrations of his eightieth birthday.  A lifelong atheist, he saw no reason to adopt religious faith in later life. He died in his sleep on 24 July 1974.His papers are held at the Churchill Archives Centre in Cambridge, and are accessible to the public. The Chadwick Laboratory at the University of Liverpool is named after him, as is its Sir James Chadwick Chair of Experimental Physics, which was named after him in 1991 as part of celebrations of the centenary of his birth. A crater on the moon is also named after him. The James Chadwick Building, which houses part of the School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Sciences, University of Manchester is named in his honour. He was described by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority official historian Lorna Arnold as \"a physicist, a scientist-diplomat, and a good, wise, and humane man.\"\n\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nNeutron temperature\nThe neutron detection temperature, also called the neutron energy, indicates a free neutron's kinetic energy, usually given in electron volts. The term temperature is used, since hot, thermal and cold neutrons are moderated in a medium with a certain temperature. The neutron energy distribution is then adapted to the Maxwell distribution known for thermal motion. Qualitatively, the higher the temperature, the higher the kinetic energy of the free neutrons. The momentum and wavelength of the neutron are related through the de Broglie relation. The large wavelength of slow neutrons allows for the large cross section.\n\nNeutron energy distribution ranges\nBut different ranges with different names are observed in other sources.The following is a detailed classification:\n\nThermal\nA thermal neutron is a free neutron with a kinetic energy of about 0.025 eV (about 4.0\u00d710\u221221 J or 2.4 MJ/kg, hence a speed of 2.19 km/s), which is the energy corresponding to the most probable speed at a temperature of 290 K (17 \u00b0C or 62 \u00b0F), the mode of the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution for this temperature, Epeak = 1/2 k T.\nAfter a number of collisions with nuclei (scattering) in a medium (neutron moderator) at this temperature, those neutrons which are not absorbed reach about this energy level.\nThermal neutrons have a different and sometimes much larger effective neutron absorption cross-section for a given nuclide than fast neutrons, and can therefore often be absorbed more easily by an atomic nucleus, creating a heavier, often unstable isotope of the chemical element as a result. This event is called neutron activation.\n\nEpithermalNeutrons of energy greater than thermal\nGreater than 0.025 eV\n\nCadmiumNeutrons which are strongly absorbed by cadmium\nLess than 0.5 eV.\n\nEpicadmiumNeutrons which are not strongly absorbed by cadmium\nGreater than 0.5 eV.\n\nCold (slow) neutronsNeutrons of lower (much lower) energy than thermal neutrons.\nLess than 5 meV.\nCold (slow) neutrons are subclassified into cold (CN), very cold (VCN), and ultra-cold (UCN) neutrons, each having particular characteristics in terms of their optical interactions with matter. As the wavelength is made (chosen to be) longer,  lower values of the momentum exchange become accessible. Therefore, it is possible to study larger scales and slower dynamics. Gravity also plays a very significant role in the case of UCN. Nevertheless, UCN reflect at all angles of incidence. This is because their momentum is comparable to the optical potential of materials. This effect is used to store them in bottles and study their fundamental properties e.g. lifetime, neutron electrical-dipole moment etc... The main limitations of the use of slow neutrons is the low flux and the lack of efficient optical devices (in the case of CN and VCN). Efficient neutron optical components are being developed and optimized to remedy this lack.\n\nResonanceRefers to neutrons which are strongly susceptible to non-fission capture by U-238.\n1 eV to 300 eV\n\nIntermediateNeutrons that are between slow and fast\nFew hundred eV to 0.5 MeV.\n\nFast\nA fast neutron is a free neutron with a kinetic energy level close to 1 MeV (100 TJ/kg), hence a speed of 14,000 km/s or higher. They are named fast neutrons to distinguish them from lower-energy thermal neutrons, and high-energy neutrons produced in cosmic showers or accelerators.Fast neutrons are produced by nuclear processes:\n\nNuclear fission produces neutrons with a mean energy of 2 MeV (200 TJ/kg, i.e. 20,000 km/s), which qualifies as \"fast\". However the range of neutrons from fission follows a Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution from 0 to about 14 MeV in the center of momentum frame of the disintegration, and the mode of the energy is only 0.75 MeV, meaning that fewer than half of fission neutrons qualify as \"fast\" even by the 1 MeV criterion.\nSpontaneous fission is a mode of radioactive decay for some heavy nuclides. Examples include plutonium-240 and californium-252.\nNuclear fusion: deuterium\u2013tritium fusion produces neutrons of 14.1 MeV (1400 TJ/kg, i.e. 52,000 km/s, 17.3% of the speed of light) that can easily fission uranium-238 and other non-fissile actinides.\nNeutron emission occurs in situations in which a nucleus contains enough excess neutrons that the separation energy of one or more neutrons becomes negative (i.e. excess neutrons \"drip\" out of the nucleus). Unstable nuclei of this sort will often decay in less than one second.Fast neutrons are usually undesirable in a steady-state nuclear reactor because most fissile fuel has a higher reaction rate with thermal neutrons. Fast neutrons can be rapidly changed into thermal neutrons via a process called moderation. This is done through numerous collisions with (in general) slower-moving and thus lower-temperature particles like atomic nuclei and other neutrons. These collisions will generally speed up the other particle and slow down the neutron and scatter it. Ideally, a room temperature neutron moderator is used for this process. In reactors, heavy water, light water, or graphite are typically used to moderate neutrons.\n\nUltrafastRelativistic\nGreater than 20 MeV\n\nOther classifications\nPile\n\nNeutrons of all energies present in nuclear reactors\n0.001 eV to 15 MeV.Ultracold\n\nNeutrons with sufficiently low energy to be reflected and trapped\nUpper bound of 335 neV\n\nFast-neutron reactor and thermal-neutron reactor compared\nMost fission reactors are thermal-neutron reactors that use a neutron moderator to slow down (\"thermalize\") the neutrons produced by nuclear fission. Moderation substantially increases the fission cross section for fissile nuclei such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239. In addition, uranium-238 has a much lower capture cross section for thermal neutrons, allowing more neutrons to cause fission of fissile nuclei and propagate the chain reaction, rather than being captured by 238U. The combination of these effects allows light water reactors to use low-enriched uranium. Heavy water reactors and graphite-moderated reactors can even use natural uranium as these moderators have much lower neutron capture cross sections than light water.An increase in fuel temperature also raises uranium-238's thermal neutron absorption by Doppler broadening, providing negative feedback to help control the reactor. When the coolant is a liquid that also contributes to moderation and absorption (light water or heavy water), boiling of the coolant will reduce the moderator density, which can provide positive or negative feedback (a positive or negative void coefficient), depending on whether the reactor is under- or over-moderated.\nIntermediate-energy neutrons have poorer fission/capture ratios than either fast or thermal neutrons for most fuels. An exception is the uranium-233 of the thorium cycle, which has a good fission/capture ratio at all neutron energies.\nFast-neutron reactors use unmoderated fast neutrons to sustain the reaction, and require the fuel to contain a higher concentration of fissile material relative to fertile material (uranium-238). However, fast neutrons have a better fission/capture ratio for many nuclides, and each fast fission releases a larger number of neutrons, so a fast breeder reactor can potentially \"breed\" more fissile fuel than it consumes.\nFast reactor control cannot depend solely on Doppler broadening or on negative void coefficient from a moderator. However, thermal expansion of the fuel itself can provide quick negative feedback. Perennially expected to be the wave of the future, fast reactor development has been nearly dormant with only a handful of reactors built in the decades since the Chernobyl accident due to low prices in the uranium market, although there is now a revival with several Asian countries planning to complete larger prototype fast reactors in the next few years.\n\nSee also\nPassage 3:\nDiscovery of the neutron\nThe discovery of the neutron and its properties was central to the extraordinary developments in atomic physics in the first half of the 20th century. Early in the century, Ernest Rutherford developed a crude model of the atom,:\u200a188\u200a based on the gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. In this model, atoms had their mass and positive electric charge concentrated in a very small nucleus. By 1920, isotopes of chemical elements had been discovered, the atomic masses had been determined to be (approximately) integer multiples of the mass of the hydrogen atom, and the atomic number had been identified as the charge on the nucleus.:\u200a\u00a71.1.2\u200a Throughout the 1920s, the nucleus was viewed as composed of combinations of protons and electrons, the two elementary particles known at the time, but that model presented several experimental and theoretical contradictions.:\u200a298\u200aThe essential nature of the atomic nucleus was established with the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 and the determination that it was a new elementary particle, distinct from the proton.:\u200a55\u200aThe uncharged neutron was immediately exploited as a new means to probe nuclear structure, leading to such discoveries as the creation of new radioactive elements by neutron irradiation (1934) and the fission of uranium atoms by neutrons (1938). The discovery of fission led to the creation of both nuclear power and nuclear weapons by the end of World War II. Both the proton and the neutron were presumed to be elementary particles until the 1960s, when they were determined to be composite particles built from quarks.\n\nDiscovery of radioactivity\nAt the start of the 20th century, the vigorous debate as to the existence of atoms had not yet been resolved. Philosophers such as Ernst Mach and Wilhelm Ostwald denied that atoms were real, viewing them as a convenient mathematical construct, while scientists such as Arnold Sommerfeld and Ludwig Boltzmann saw that physical theories required the existence of atoms.:\u200a13\u201314\u200aRadioactivity was discovered in 1896 by the French scientist Henri Becquerel, while working with phosphorescent materials.  In 1898, Ernest Rutherford at Cavendish Laboratory distinguished two types of radioactivity, alpha rays and beta rays, which differed in their ability to penetrate, or travel into, ordinary objects or gases. Two years later, Paul Villard discovered gamma rays, which possessed even more penetrating power.:\u200a8\u20139\u200a These radiations were soon identified with known particles:  beta rays were shown to be electrons by Walter Kaufmann in 1902; alpha rays were shown to be helium ions by Rutherford and Thomas Royds in 1907; and gamma rays were shown to be electromagnetic radiation, that is, a form of light, by Rutherford and Edward Andrade in 1914.:\u200a61\u201362,\u200a87\u200a These radiations had also been identified as emanating from atoms, hence they provided clues to processes occurring within atoms.  Conversely, the radiations were also recognized as tools that could be exploited in scattering experiments to probe the interior of atoms.:\u200a112\u2013115\n\nThe gold foil experiment and the discovery of the atomic nucleus\nAt the University of Manchester between 1908 and 1913, Rutherford directed Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden in a series of experiments to determine what happens when alpha particles scatter from metal foil. Now called the Rutherford gold foil experiment, or the Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment, these measurements made the extraordinary discovery that although most alpha particles passing through a thin gold foil experienced little deflection, a few scattered to a high angle. The scattering indicated that some of the alpha particles ricocheted back from a small, but dense, component inside the atoms. Based on these measurements, by 1911 it was apparent to Rutherford that the atom consisted of a small, massive nucleus with positive charge surrounded by a much larger cloud of negatively charged electrons. The concentrated atomic mass was required to provide the observed deflection of the alpha particles, and Rutherford developed a mathematical model that accounted for the scattering.The Rutherford model was very influential, motivating the Bohr model for electrons orbiting the nucleus in 1913 and eventually leading to quantum mechanics by the mid-1920s.\n\nDiscovery of isotopes\nConcurrent with the work of Rutherford, Geiger, and Marsden, the radiochemist Frederick Soddy at the University of Glasgow was studying chemistry related problems on radioactive materials. Soddy had worked with Rutherford on radioactivity at McGill University. By 1910, about 40 different radioactive elements, referred to as radioelements, had been identified between uranium and lead, although the periodic table only allowed for 11 elements. Soddy and Kazimierz Fajans independently found in 1913 that an element undergoing alpha decay will produce an element two places to the left in the periodic system and an element undergoing beta decay will produce an element one place to the right in the periodic system.  Also, those radioelements that reside in the same places in the periodic system are chemically identical.  Soddy called these chemically identical elements  isotopes.:\u200a3\u20135\u200a For his study of radioactivity and the discovery of isotopes, Soddy was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\nBuilding from work by J. J. Thomson on the deflection of positively charged atoms by electric and magnetic fields, Francis Aston built the first mass spectrograph at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1919. His aim, which he easily achieved, was to separate the two isotopes of neon, 20Ne and 22Ne. Aston discovered that the masses of all the particles are whole numbers (the whole number rule): that is, the masses of all the isotopes are whole number multiples of the mass of the hydrogen atom. In these measurements, Aston arbitrarily computed his masses relative to oxygen-16, which he took to have a mass of exactly 16. (Today the atomic mass unit (amu) is relative to carbon-12.) Ironically, the one exception to this rule was hydrogen itself, which had a mass value of 1.008. The excess mass was small, but well outside the limits of experimental uncertainty. Aston and others quickly realized that the discrepancy is due to the binding energy of atoms, that is, the mass of a number of hydrogen atoms bound into a single atom must be less than the sum of the masses of the separate hydrogen atoms.  Aston's work on isotopes won him the 1922 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of isotopes in a large number of non-radioactive elements, and for his enunciation of the whole number rule. Noting Aston's recent discovery of nuclear binding energy, in 1920 Arthur Eddington suggested that stars may obtain their energy by fusing hydrogen (protons) into helium and that the heavier elements may form in stars.\n\nAtomic number and Moseley's law\nRutherford and others had noted the disparity between the mass of an atom, computed in atomic mass units, and the approximate charge required on the nucleus for the Rutherford model to work. The required charge of the atomic nucleus was usually about half its atomic mass.:\u200a82\u200aAntonius van den Broek boldly hypothesized that the required charge, denoted by Z, was not half of the atomic weight for elements, but instead was exactly equal to the element's ordinal position in the periodic table.:\u200a228\u200a At that time, the positions of the elements in the periodic table were not known to have any physical significance.  If the elements were ordered based on increasing atomic mass, however, periodicity in chemical properties was exhibited.  Exceptions to this periodicity were apparent, however, such as cobalt and nickel.:\u200a180\u200aAt the University of Manchester in 1913 Henry Moseley discussed the new Bohr model of the atom with the visiting Bohr. The model accounted for the electromagnetic emission spectrum from the hydrogen atom, and Moseley and Bohr wondered if the electromagnetic emission spectra of heavier elements such as cobalt and nickel would follow their ordering by weight, or by their position in the periodic table.:\u200a346\u200a In 1913\u20131914 Moseley tested the question experimentally by using X-ray diffraction techniques. He found that the most intense short-wavelength line in the X-ray spectrum of a particular element, known as the K-alpha line, was related to the element's position in the periodic table, that is, its atomic number, Z. Indeed, Moseley introduced this nomenclature.:\u200a\u00a71.1.2\u200a Moseley found that the frequencies of the radiation were related in a simple way to the atomic number of the elements for a large number of elements.:\u200a5\u200a:\u200a181\u200aWithin a year it was noted that the equation for the relation, now called Moseley's law, could be explained in terms of the 1913 Bohr model, with reasonable extra assumptions about atomic structure in other elements.:\u200a87\u200a Moseley's result, by Bohr's later account, not only established atomic number as a measurable experimental quantity, but gave it a physical meaning as the positive charge on the atomic nucleus. The elements could be ordered in the periodic system in order of atomic number, rather than atomic weight.:\u200a127\u200a The result tied together the organization of the periodic table, the Bohr model for the atom,:\u200a56\u200a and Rutherford's model for alpha scattering from nuclei. It was cited by Rutherford, Bohr, and others as a critical advance in understanding the nature of the atomic nucleus.Further research in atomic physics was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. Moseley was killed in 1915 at the Battle of Gallipoli,:\u200a182\u200a while Rutherford's student James Chadwick was interned in Germany for the duration of the war, 1914\u20131918. In Berlin, Lise Meitner's and Otto Hahn's research work on determining the radioactive decay chains of radium and uranium by precise chemical separation was interrupted.:\u200a\u00a74\u200a Meitner spent much of the war working as a radiologist and medical X-ray technician near the Austrian front, while Hahn, a chemist, worked on research in poison gas warfare.:\u200a61\u201362,\u200a68\n\nRutherford atom\nIn 1920 Rutherford gave a Bakerian lecture at the Royal Society entitled the \"Nuclear Constitution of Atoms\", a summary of recent experiments on atomic nuclei and conclusions as to the structure of atomic nuclei.:\u200a23\u200a:\u200a5\u200a By 1920, the existence of electrons within the atomic nucleus was widely assumed.  It was assumed the nucleus consisted of hydrogen nuclei in number equal to the atomic mass.  But since each hydrogen nucleus had charge +1, the nucleus required a smaller number of \"internal electrons\" each of charge \u22121 to give the nucleus its correct total charge. The mass of protons is about 1800 times greater than that of electrons, so the mass of the electrons is incidental in this computation.:\u200a230\u2013231\u200a  Such a model was consistent with the scattering of alpha particles from heavy nuclei, as well as the charge and mass of the many isotopes that had been identified.  There were other motivations for the proton\u2013electron model.  As noted by Rutherford at the time, \"We have strong reason for believing that the nuclei of atoms contain electrons as well as positively charged bodies...\",:\u200a376\u2013377\u200a namely, it was known that beta radiation was electrons emitted from the nucleus.:\u200a21\u200a:\u200a5\u20136\u200aIn that lecture, Rutherford conjectured the existence of new particles.  The alpha particle was known to be very stable, and it was assumed to retain its identity within the nucleus.  The alpha particle was presumed to consist of four protons and two closely bound electrons to give it +2 charge and mass 4.  In a 1919 paper, Rutherford had reported the apparent discovery of a new doubly charged particle of mass 3, denoted the X++, interpreted to consist of three protons and a closely bound electron.  This result suggested to Rutherford the likely existence of two new particles: one of two protons with a closely bound electron, and another of one proton and a closely bound electron. The X++ particle was later determined to have mass 4 and to be just a low-energy alpha particle.:\u200a25\u200a Nevertheless, Rutherford had conjectured the existence of the deuteron, a +1 charge particle of mass 2, and the neutron, a neutral particle of mass 1.:\u200a396\u200a  The former is the nucleus of deuterium, discovered in 1931 by Harold Urey. The mass of the hypothetical neutral particle would be little different from that of the proton. Rutherford determined that such a zero-charge particle would be difficult to detect by available techniques.:\u200a396\u200aAbout the time of Rutherford's lecture, other publications appeared with similar suggestions of a proton\u2013electron composite in the nucleus, and in 1921 William Harkins, an American chemist, named the uncharged particle the neutron.:\u200a6\u200a About that same time the word proton was adopted for the hydrogen nucleus.  Neutron was apparently constructed from the Latin root for neutral and the Greek ending -on (by imitation of electron and proton). References to the word neutron in connection with the atom can be found in the literature as early as 1899, however.:\u200a398\u200aRutherford and Chadwick immediately began an experimental program at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge to search for the neutron.:\u200a27\u200a:\u200a398\u200a  The experiments continued throughout the 1920s without success.Rutherford's conjecture and the hypothetical \"neutron\" were not widely accepted.  In his 1931 monograph on the Constitution of Atomic Nuclei and Radioactivity, George Gamow, then at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen, did not mention the neutron.  At the time of their 1932 measurements in Paris that would lead to the discovery of the neutron, Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot were unaware of the conjecture.\n\nProblems of the nuclear electrons hypothesis\nThroughout the 1920s, physicists assumed that the atomic nucleus was composed of protons and \"nuclear electrons\".:\u200a29\u201332\u200a Under this hypothesis, the nitrogen-14 (14N) nucleus would be composed of 14 protons and 7 electrons, so that it would have a net charge of +7 elementary charge units and a mass of 14 atomic mass units. This nucleus would also be orbited by another 7 electrons, termed \"external electrons\" by Rutherford,:\u200a375\u200a to complete the 14N atom. However problems with the hypothesis soon became apparent.\nRalph Kronig pointed out in 1926 that the observed hyperfine structure of atomic spectra was inconsistent with the proton\u2013electron hypothesis. This structure is caused by the influence of the nucleus on the dynamics of orbiting electrons. The magnetic moments of supposed \"nuclear electrons\" should produce hyperfine spectral line splittings similar to the Zeeman effect, but no such effects were observed.:\u200a199\u200a  It seemed that the magnetic moment of the electron vanished when it was within the nucleus.:\u200a299\u200aWhile on a visit to Utrecht University in 1928, Kronig learned of a surprising aspect of the rotational spectrum of N2+. The precision measurement made by Leonard Ornstein, the director of Utrecht's Physical Laboratory, showed that the spin of nitrogen nucleus must be equal to one. However, if the nitrogen-14 (14N) nucleus was composed of 14 protons and 7 electrons, an odd number of spin-1/2 particles, then the resultant nuclear spin should be half-integer. Kronig therefore suggested that perhaps \"protons and  electrons do not retain their identity to the extent they do outside the nucleus\".:\u200a299\u2013301\u200a:\u200a117\u200aObservations of the rotational energy levels of diatomic molecules using Raman spectroscopy by Franco Rasetti in 1929 were inconsistent with the statistics expected from the proton\u2013electron hypothesis. Rasetti obtained band spectra for H2 and N2 molecules.  While the lines for both diatomic molecules showed alternation in intensity between light and dark, the pattern of alternation for H2 is opposite to that of the N2. After carefully analyzing these experimental results, German physicists Walter Heitler and Gerhard Herzberg showed that the hydrogen nuclei obey Fermi statistics and the nitrogen nuclei obey Bose statistics. However, a then unpublished result of Eugene Wigner showed that a composite system with an odd number of spin-1/2 particles must obey Fermi statistics; a system with an even number of spin-1/2 particle obeys Bose statistics. If the nitrogen nucleus had 21 particles, it should obey Fermi statistics, contrary to fact. Thus, Heitler and Herzberg concluded: \"the electron in the nucleus ... loses its ability to determine the statistics of the nucleus.\":\u200a117\u2013118\u200aThe Klein paradox, discovered by Oskar Klein in 1928, presented further quantum mechanical objections to the notion of an electron confined within a nucleus.  Derived from the Dirac equation, this clear and precise paradox suggested that an  electron approaching a high potential barrier has a high probability of passing through the barrier by a pair creation process.  Apparently, an electron could not be confined within a nucleus by any potential well. The meaning of this paradox was intensely debated at the time.:\u200a199\u2013200\u200aBy about 1930 it was generally recognized that it was difficult to reconcile the proton\u2013electron model for nuclei with the Heisenberg uncertainty relation of quantum mechanics.:\u200a199\u200a:\u200a299\u200a This relation, \u0394x\u22c5\u0394p \u2265 1\u20442\u0127, implies that an electron confined to a region the size of an atomic nucleus typically has a kinetic energy of about 40 MeV,:\u200a299\u200a which is larger than the observed energy of beta particles emitted from the nucleus. Such energy is also much larger than the binding energy of nucleons,:\u200a89\u200a which Aston and others had shown to be less than 9 MeV per nucleon.:\u200a511\u200aIn 1927, Charles Ellis and W. Wooster at the Cavendish Laboratory measured the energies of \u03b2-decay electrons.  They found that the distribution of energies from any particular radioactive nuclei was broad and continuous, a result that contrasted notably with the distinct energy values observed in alpha and gamma decay. Further, the continuous energy distribution seemed to indicate that energy was not conserved by this \"nuclear electrons\" process.  Indeed, in 1929 Bohr proposed to modify the law of energy conservation to account for the continuous energy distribution. The proposal earned the support of Werner Heisenberg. Such considerations were apparently reasonable, inasmuch as the laws of quantum mechanics had so recently overturned the laws of classical mechanics.\nWhile all these considerations did not \"prove\" an electron could not exist in the nucleus, they were confusing and challenging for physicists to interpret.  Many theories were invented to explain how the above arguments could be wrong.:\u200a4\u20135\u200a In his 1931 monograph, Gamow summarized all these contradictions, marking the statements regarding electrons in the nucleus with warning symbols.:\u200a23\n\nDiscovery of the neutron\nIn 1930, Walther Bothe and his collaborator Herbert Becker in Giessen, Germany found that if the energetic alpha particles emitted from polonium fell on certain light elements, specifically beryllium (94Be), boron (115B), or lithium (73Li), an unusually penetrating radiation was produced. Beryllium produced the most intense radiation.  Polonium is highly radioactive, producing energetic alpha radiation, and it was commonly used for scattering experiments at the time.:\u200a99\u2013110\u200a Alpha radiation can be influenced by an electric field, because it is composed of charged particles.  The observed penetrating radiation was not influenced by an electric field, however, so it was thought to be gamma radiation. The radiation was more penetrating than any gamma rays known, and the details of experimental results were difficult to interpret.\n\nTwo years later Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot in Paris showed that if this unknown radiation fell on paraffin wax, or any other hydrogen-containing compound, it ejected protons of very high energy (5 MeV). This observation was not in itself inconsistent with the assumed gamma ray nature of the new radiation, but that interpretation (Compton scattering) had a logical problem.  From energy and momentum considerations, a gamma ray would have to have impossibly high energy (50 MeV) to scatter a massive proton.:\u200a\u00a71.3.1\u200a In Rome, the young physicist Ettore Majorana declared that the manner in which the new radiation interacted with\nprotons required a new neutral particle.On hearing of the Paris results, neither Rutherford nor James Chadwick at the Cavendish Laboratory believed the gamma ray hypothesis. Assisted by Norman Feather, Chadwick quickly performed a series of experiments showing that the gamma ray hypothesis was untenable. The previous year, Chadwick, J.E.R. Constable, and E.C. Pollard had already conducted experiments on disintegrating light elements using alpha radiation from polonium. They had also developed more accurate and efficient methods for detecting, counting, and recording the ejected protons. Chadwick repeated the creation of the radiation using beryllium to absorb the alpha particles: 9Be + 4He (\u03b1) \u2192  12C + 1n. Following the Paris experiment, he aimed the radiation at paraffin wax, a hydrocarbon high in hydrogen content, hence offering a target dense with protons. As in the Paris experiment, the radiation energetically scattered some of the protons. Chadwick measured the range of these protons, and also measured how the new radiation impacted the atoms of various gases. He found that the new radiation consisted of not gamma rays, but uncharged particles with about the same mass as the proton. These particles were neutrons. Chadwick won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935 for this discovery.The year 1932 was later referred to as the \"annus mirabilis\" for nuclear physics in the Cavendish Laboratory, with discoveries of the neutron, artificial nuclear disintegration by the Cockcroft\u2013Walton particle accelerator, and the positron.\n\nProton\u2013neutron model of the nucleus\nGiven the problems of the proton\u2013electron model, it was quickly accepted that the atomic nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons, although the precise nature of the neutron was initially unclear. Within months after the discovery of the neutron, Werner Heisenberg and Dmitri Ivanenko had proposed proton\u2013neutron models for the nucleus. Heisenberg's landmark papers approached the description of protons and neutrons in the nucleus through quantum mechanics. While Heisenberg's theory for protons and neutrons in the nucleus was a \"major step toward understanding the nucleus as a quantum mechanical system,\" he still assumed the presence of nuclear electrons. In particular, Heisenberg assumed the neutron was a proton\u2013electron composite, for which there is no quantum mechanical explanation. Heisenberg had no explanation for how lightweight electrons could be bound within the nucleus. Heisenberg introduced the first theory of nuclear exchange forces that bind the nucleons. He considered protons and neutrons to be different quantum states of the same particle, i.e., nucleons distinguished by the value of their nuclear isospin quantum numbers.\nThe proton\u2013neutron model explained the puzzle of dinitrogen. When 14N was proposed to consist of 3 pairs each of protons and neutrons, with an additional unpaired neutron and proton each contributing a spin of 1\u20442 \u0127 in the same direction for a total spin of 1 \u0127, the model became viable. Soon, neutrons were used to naturally explain spin differences in many different nuclides in the same way.\nIf the proton\u2013neutron model for the nucleus resolved many issues, it highlighted the problem of explaining the origins of beta radiation. No existing theory could account for how electrons, or positrons, could emanate from the nucleus. In 1934, Enrico Fermi published his classic paper describing the process of beta decay, in which the neutron decays to a proton by creating an electron and a (as yet undiscovered) neutrino. The paper employed the analogy that photons, or electromagnetic radiation, were similarly created and destroyed in atomic processes. Ivanenko had suggested a similar analogy in 1932. Fermi's theory requires the neutron to be a spin-1\u20442 particle. The theory preserved the principle of conservation of energy, which had been thrown into question by the continuous energy distribution of beta particles. The basic theory for beta decay proposed by Fermi was the first to show how particles could be created and destroyed. It established a general, basic theory for the interaction of particles by weak or strong forces. While this influential paper has stood the test of time, the ideas within it were so new that when it was first submitted to the journal Nature in 1933 it was rejected as being too speculative.\n\nThe nature of the neutron\nThe question of whether the neutron was a composite particle of a proton and an electron persisted for a few years after its discovery. In 1932 Harrie Massey explored a model for a composite neutron to account for its great penetrating power through matter and its electrical neutrality, for example. The issue was a legacy of the prevailing view from the 1920s that the only elementary particles were the proton and electron.\nThe nature of the neutron was a primary topic of discussion at the 7th Solvay Conference held in October 1933, attended by Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, Lise Meitner, Ernest Lawrence, Fermi, Chadwick, and others. As posed by Chadwick in his Bakerian Lecture in 1933, the primary question was the mass of the neutron relative to the proton. If the neutron's mass was less than the combined masses of a proton and an electron (1.0078 u), then the neutron could be a proton-electron composite because of the mass defect from the nuclear binding energy. If greater than the combined masses, then the neutron was elementary like the proton. The question was challenging to answer because the electron's mass is only 0.05% of the proton's, hence exceptionally precise measurements were required.\nThe difficulty of making the measurement is illustrated by the wide-ranging values for the mass of the neutron obtained from 1932 to 1934. The accepted value today is 1.00866 u. In Chadwick's 1932 paper reporting on the discovery, he estimated the mass of the neutron to be between 1.005 u and 1.008 u. By bombarding boron with alpha particles, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie obtained a high value of 1.012 u, while Ernest Lawrence's team at the University of California measured the small value 1.0006 u using their new cyclotron.In 1935 Chadwick and his doctoral student Maurice Goldhaber resolved the issue by reporting the first accurate measurement of the mass of the neutron. They used the 2.6 MeV gamma rays of Thallium-208 (208Tl) (then known as thorium C\") to photodisintegrate the deuteron.\nIn this reaction, the resulting proton and neutron have about equal kinetic energy, since their masses are about equal.  The kinetic energy of the resulting proton could be measured (0.24 MeV), and therefore the deuteron's binding energy could be determined (2.6 MeV \u2212 2(0.24 MeV) = 2.1 MeV, or 0.0023 u). The neutron's mass could then be determined by the simple mass balance\n\nwhere md,p,n refer to the deuteron, proton, or neutron mass, and \"b.e.\" is the binding energy. The masses of the deuteron and proton were known; Chadwick and Goldhaber used values 2.0142 u and 1.0081 u, respectively.  They found that the neutron's mass was slightly greater than the mass of the proton 1.0084 u or 1.0090 u, depending on the precise value used for the deuteron mass. The mass of the neutron was too large to be a proton\u2013electron composite, and the neutron was therefore identified as an elementary particle.  Chadwick and Goldhaber predicted that a free neutron would be able to decay into a proton, electron, and neutrino (beta decay).\n\nNeutron physics in the 1930s\nSoon after the discovery of the neutron, indirect evidence suggested the neutron had an unexpected non-zero value for its magnetic moment. Attempts to measure the neutron's magnetic moment originated with the discovery by Otto Stern in 1933 in Hamburg that the proton had an anomalously large magnetic moment. By 1934 groups led by Stern, now in Pittsburgh, and I. I. Rabi in New York had independently deduced that the magnetic moment of the neutron was negative and unexpectedly large by measuring the magnetic moments of the proton and deuteron. Values for the magnetic moment of the neutron were also determined by Robert Bacher (1933) at Ann Arbor and I.Y. Tamm and S.A. Altshuler (1934) in the Soviet Union from studies of the hyperfine structure of atomic spectra. By the late 1930s accurate values for the magnetic moment of the neutron had been deduced by the Rabi group using measurements employing newly developed nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The large value for the proton's magnetic moment and the inferred negative value for the neutron's magnetic moment were unexpected and raised many questions.\n\nThe discovery of the neutron immediately gave scientists a new tool for probing the properties of atomic nuclei. Alpha particles had been used over the previous decades in scattering experiments, but such particles, which are helium nuclei, have +2 charge. This charge makes it difficult for alpha particles to overcome the Coulomb repulsive force and interact directly with the nuclei of atoms. Since neutrons have no electric charge, they do not have to overcome this force to interact with nuclei. Almost coincident with their discovery, neutrons were used by Norman Feather, Chadwick's colleague and protege, in scattering experiments with nitrogen. Feather was able to show that neutrons interacting with nitrogen nuclei scattered to protons or induced nitrogen to disintegrate to form boron with the emission of an alpha particle. Feather was therefore the first to show that neutrons produce nuclear disintegrations.\nIn Rome, Enrico Fermi and his team bombarded heavier elements with neutrons and found the products to be radioactive. By 1934 they had used neutrons to induce radioactivity in 22 different elements, many of these elements of high atomic number. Noticing that other experiments with neutrons at his laboratory seemed to work better on a wooden table than a marble table, Fermi suspected that the protons of the wood were slowing the neutrons and so increasing the chance for the neutron to interact with nuclei. Fermi therefore passed neutrons through paraffin wax to slow them and found that the radioactivity of some bombarded elements increased by a factor of tens to hundreds. The cross section for interaction with nuclei is much larger for slow neutrons than for fast neutrons. In 1938 Fermi received the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons\".\n\nIn Berlin, the collaboration of Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn, together with their assistant Fritz Strassmann, furthered the research begun by Fermi and his team when they bombarded uranium with neutrons. Between 1934 and 1938, Hahn, Meitner, and Strassmann found a great number of radioactive transmutation products from these experiments, all of which they regarded as transuranic. Transuranic nuclides are those that have an atomic number greater than uranium (92), formed by neutron absorption; such nuclides are not naturally occurring. In July 1938, Meitner was forced to escape antisemitic persecution in Nazi Germany after the Anschluss, and she was able to secure a new position in Sweden. The decisive experiment on 16\u201317 December 1938 (using a chemical process called \"radium\u2013barium\u2013mesothorium fractionation\") produced puzzling results: what they had understood to be three isotopes of radium were instead consistently behaving as barium. Radium (atomic number 88) and barium (atomic number 56) are in the same chemical group.  By January 1939 Hahn had concluded that what they had thought were transuranic nuclides were instead much lighter nuclides, such as barium, lanthanum, cerium and light platinoids. Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch immediately and correctly interpreted these observations as resulting from nuclear fission, a term coined by Frisch.Hahn and his collaborators had detected the splitting of uranium nuclei, made unstable by neutron absorption, into lighter elements. Meitner and Frisch also showed that the fission of each uranium atom would release about 200 MeV of energy. The discovery of fission electrified the global community of atomic physicists and the public.  In their second publication on nuclear fission, Hahn and Strassmann predicted the existence and liberation of additional neutrons during the fission process. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot and his team proved this phenomenon to be a chain reaction in March 1939. In 1945 Hahn received the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"for his discovery of the fission of heavy atomic nuclei.\"\n\nAfter 1939\nThe discovery of nuclear fission at the end of 1938 marked a shift in the centers of nuclear research from Europe to the United States. Large numbers of scientists were migrating to the United States to escape the troubles and antisemitism in Europe and the looming war:\u200a407\u2013410\u200a (See Jewish scientists and the Manhattan Project). The new centers of nuclear research were the universities in the United States, particularly Columbia University in New York and the University of Chicago where Enrico Fermi had relocated, and a secret research facility at Los Alamos, New Mexico, established in 1942, the new home of the Manhattan project. This wartime project was focussed on the construction of nuclear weapons, exploiting the enormous energy released by the fission of uranium or plutonium through neutron-based chain reactions.\nThe discoveries of the neutron and positron in 1932 were the start of the discoveries of many new particles.  Muons were discovered in 1936.  Pions and kaons were discovered in 1947, while lambda particles were discovered in 1950.  Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, a large number of particles called hadrons were discovered.  A classification scheme for organizing all these particles, proposed independently by Murray Gell-Mann and\nGeorge Zweig in 1964, became known as the quark model. By this model, particles such as the proton and neutron were not elementary, but composed of various configurations of a small number of other truly elementary particles called partons or quarks. The quark model received experimental verification beginning in the late 1960s and finally provided an explanation for the neutron's anomalous magnetic moment.\n\nVideos\nErnest Rutherford summarizes the state of nuclear physics in 1935.

    "Passage 1:\nBritish nationality law\nThe primary law governing nationality in the United Kingdom is the British Nationality Act 1981, which came into force on 1 January 1983. Regulations apply to the British Islands, which include the UK itself and the Crown dependencies, and the 14 British Overseas Territories.\nThe six classes of British nationality each have varying degrees of civil and political rights, due to the UK's historical status as a colonial empire. The principal class of British nationality is British citizenship, which is associated with the British Islands. British nationals associated with an overseas territory are British Overseas Territories citizens (BOTCs). Almost all BOTCs (except for those from Akrotiri and Dhekelia) have also been British citizens since 2002. Individuals connected with former British colonies may hold residual forms of British nationality, which do not confer an automatic right of abode in the United Kingdom and generally may no longer be acquired. These residual nationalities are the statuses of British Overseas citizen, British subject, British National (Overseas), and British protected person.\nAll persons born in the British Islands before 1 January 1983 were automatically granted citizenship by birth regardless of the nationalities of their parents. Individuals born in those territories since that date only receive citizenship at birth if at least the mother is a British citizen or holds settled status. Foreign nationals may naturalise as British citizens after meeting a minimum residence requirement (usually five years) and acquiring settled status.\nThe United Kingdom was previously a member state of the European Union (EU) and British citizens held full EU citizenship. They had held automatic and permanent permission to live and work in any EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country and were able to vote in elections to the European Parliament. Despite the UK's withdrawal from the union in 2020, British citizens continue to hold permanent permission to work and reside in the Republic of Ireland as part of the Common Travel Area.\n\nTerminology\nThe distinction between the meaning of the terms citizenship and nationality is not always clear in the English language and differs by country. Generally, nationality refers to a person's legal belonging to a sovereign state and is the common term used in international treaties when addressing members of a country, while citizenship usually means the set of rights and duties a person has in that nation. This distinction is clearly defined in many non-English speaking countries but not in the Anglosphere. Historically, an individual associated with Britain was neither a national nor a citizen, but a British subject. British citizenship was not created until passage of the British Nationality Act 1981. This Act defined six types of nationality with varying degrees of civil and political rights, dependent on a person's connections with the United Kingdom, overseas territories, or former colonies. British citizens hold their status because of a close connection with the British Islands, usually through their own (or parents' or grandparents') birth, adoption, naturalisation, or registration as citizens of the UK.\n\nTypes of British nationality\nThere are six types of British nationality: any person who is a British citizen, British Overseas Territories citizen (BOTC), British Overseas citizen (BOC), British National (Overseas) (BN(O)), British subject, or British protected person is a British national. Of these statuses, only British citizenship grants automatic right of abode in the United Kingdom. British Overseas Territories are areas outside of the British Islands where the UK holds sovereignty. Since 2002, nearly all BOTCs also hold British citizenship, except for those associated with Akrotiri and Dhekelia.The other four categories are residual nationality classes that generally cannot be acquired. BOCs are people connected with former British colonies who have no close ties to the UK or overseas territories. BN(O)s are Hong Kong residents who voluntarily registered for this status before the territory's transfer to China in 1997. British subjects hold their status through a connection either to former  British India or to what is now the Republic of Ireland as they existed before 1949. British protected persons come from areas controlled by the British Empire but were never formally incorporated as Crown territory; this includes protectorates, protected states, mandated territories, and Indian princely states.\n\nHistory\nDevelopment from feudal allegiance\nBefore the concept of nationality was codified in legislation, inhabitants of English communities owed allegiance to their feudal lords, who were themselves vassals of the monarch. This system of loyalty, indirectly owed to the monarch personally, developed into a general establishment of subjecthood to the Crown. Calvin's Case in 1608 established the principle of jus soli, that all those who were born within Crown dominions were natural-born subjects. After passage of the Acts of Union 1707, English and Scottish subjects became British subjects. Similarly, the Kingdom of Ireland was merged with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. Natural-born subjects were considered to owe perpetual allegiance to the Crown and could not voluntarily renounce British subject status until this was first permitted in 1870.Prior to 1708, foreigners could only be naturalised through Acts of Parliament. Protestants fleeing religious persecution in mainland Europe were allowed to naturalise as subjects in 1708, but this was quickly repealed in 1711 in response to the number of migrants exercising that ability. A standard administrative process was not introduced until 1844, when applicants were first able to acquire naturalisation grants from the Home Office. Despite the creation of this pathway, personalised naturalising legislation continued to be enacted until 1975.The monarch could personally make any individual a subject by royal prerogative. By this method, a foreigner became a denizen \u2013 although they were no longer considered an alien, they could not pass subject status to their children by descent and were barred from Crown service and public office. This mechanism was no longer used after 1873.Until the mid-19th century, it was unclear whether nationality regulations in the United Kingdom were applicable elsewhere in the British Empire. Individual colonies had each developed their own procedures and requirements for naturalisation, granting subject status at the discretion of the local governments. In 1847, Parliament formalised a clear distinction between subjects who were naturalised in the UK and those who became British subjects in other territories. Individuals who naturalised in the UK were deemed to have received the status by imperial naturalisation, which was valid throughout the Empire. Those naturalising in colonies were said to have gone through local naturalisation and were given subject status valid only within the relevant territory; a subject who locally naturalised in Canada was a British subject there, but not in England or New Zealand. When travelling outside of the Empire, British subjects who were locally naturalised in a colony were still entitled to imperial protection.Certain territories that came under British jurisdiction were not formally incorporated as Crown territory proper. These included protectorates, protected states, mandated territories, and Indian princely states. Because domestic law treated these areas as foreign territory, birth in one of these areas did not automatically confer British subject status. Instead, most people associated with these territories were designated as British protected persons. British protected persons were treated as aliens in the United Kingdom, but both British subjects and protected persons could be issued British passports. Protected persons could not travel to the UK without first requesting permission, but were afforded the same consular protection as British subjects when travelling outside of the Empire.\n\nImperial common code\nParliament brought regulations for British subject status into codified statute law for the first time with passage of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914. British subject status was standardised as a common nationality across the Empire. Dominions that adopted Part II of this Act as part of local legislation were authorised to grant subject status to aliens by imperial naturalisation.The 1914 regulations codified the doctrine of coverture into imperial nationality law, where a woman's consent to marry a foreigner was also assumed to be intent to denaturalise; British women who married foreign men automatically lost their British nationality. There were two exceptions to this: a wife married to a husband who lost his British subject status was able to retain British nationality by declaration, and a British-born widow or divorc\u00e9e who had lost her British nationality through marriage could reacquire that status without meeting residence requirements after the dissolution or termination of her marriage.By the end of the First World War, the Dominions had exercised increasing levels of autonomy in managing their own affairs and each by then had developed a distinct national identity. Britain formally recognised this at the 1926 Imperial Conference, jointly issuing the Balfour Declaration with all the Dominion heads of government, which stated that the United Kingdom and Dominions were autonomous and equal to each other within the British Commonwealth of Nations. Full legislative independence was granted to the Dominions with passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931.Women's rights groups throughout the Empire pressured the imperial government during this time to amend nationality regulations that tied a married woman's status to that of her husband. Because the government could no longer enforce legislative supremacy over the Dominions after 1931 and wanted to maintain a strong constitutional link to them through the common nationality code, it was unwilling to make major changes without unanimous agreement among the Dominions on this issue, which it did not have. Imperial legal uniformity was nevertheless eroded during the 1930s; New Zealand and Australia amended their laws in 1935 and 1936 to allow women denaturalised by marriage to retain their rights as British subjects, and Ireland changed its regulations in 1935 to cause no change to a woman's nationality after her marriage.\n\nIrish independence\nIrish resistance to the Union and desire for local self-governance led to the Irish War of Independence. Following the war, the island of Ireland was partitioned into two parts. Southern Ireland became the Irish Free State in 1922, while Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Northern Ireland was included in the Irish Free State on independence, but had the right to opt out of the new state within one month of its establishment. This option was exercised on 7 December 1922. The 24-hour period in which Northern Ireland was officially part of the Irish Free State meant that every person ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland on 6 December who fulfilled the citizenship provisions in the Constitution of the Irish Free State had automatically become an Irish citizen on that date.At its inception, the Irish Free State gained independence as a Dominion within the British Empire. Imperial legislation at the time dictated that although individual Dominions could define a citizenship for their own citizens, that citizenship would only be effective within the local Dominion's borders. A Canadian, New Zealand, or Irish citizen who traveled outside of their own country would have been regarded as a British subject. This was reinforced by Article 3 of the 1922 Free State Constitution, which stated that Irish citizenship could be exercised \"within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State\".When Free State authorities were first preparing to issue Irish passports in 1923, the British government insisted on the inclusion of some type of wording that described the holders of these passports as \"British subjects\". The two sides could not reach agreement on this issue and when the Irish government began issuing passports in 1924, British authorities refused to accept these documents. British consular staff were instructed to confiscate any Irish passports that did not include the term \"British subject\" and replace them with British passports. This situation continued until 1930, when Irish passports were amended to describe its holders as \"one of His Majesty's subjects of the Irish Free State\". Despite these disagreements, the two governments agreed not to establish border controls between their jurisdictions and all Irish citizens and British subjects continued to have the ability to move freely within the Common Travel Area. Although Irish citizens have not been considered British subjects under Irish law since 1935, the British government continued to treat virtually all Irish citizens as British subjects, except for those who had acquired Irish citizenship by naturalisation since the Free State had not incorporated Part II of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 into its legislation.\n\nChanging relationship with the Empire and Commonwealth\nDiverging developments in Dominion legislation, as well as growing assertions of local national identity separate from that of Britain and the Empire, culminated with the creation of a substantive Canadian citizenship in 1946, breaking the system of a common imperial nationality. Combined with the approaching independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, comprehensive reform to nationality law was necessary at this point to address ideas that were incompatible with the previous system.The British Nationality Act 1948 redefined British subject as any citizen of the United Kingdom, its colonies, or other Commonwealth countries. Commonwealth citizen was first defined in this Act to have the same meaning. This alternative term was necessary to retain a number of newly independent countries in the Commonwealth that wished to become republics rather than preserve the monarch as head of state. The change in naming also indicated a shift in the base theory to this aspect of British nationality; allegiance to the Crown was no longer a requirement to possess British subject status and the common status would be maintained by voluntary agreement among the various members of the Commonwealth.British subject/Commonwealth citizen status co-existed with the citizenships of each Commonwealth country. A person born in Australia would be both an Australian citizen and a British subject. British subjects under the previous meaning who held that status on 1 January 1949 because of a connection with the United Kingdom or a remaining colony became Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC). CUKC status was the principal form of British nationality during this period of time.There was also a category of people called British subjects without citizenship. Irish citizens who fulfilled certain requirements could file formal claims with the Home Secretary to remain British subjects under this definition. Additionally, those who did not qualify for CUKC status or citizenship in other Commonwealth countries, or were connected with a country that had not yet defined citizenship laws, would transitionally remain British subjects in this group.\n\nIrish departure from the Commonwealth\nDespite the accommodations for republics, Ireland ended its Commonwealth membership in 1948 when it formally declared itself a republic and removed the British monarch's remaining official functions in the Irish state. This was recognised by Britain after passage of the Ireland Act 1949. Although Irish citizens have no longer been defined as British subjects in British law since 1949, they continue to be treated as non-foreign in the United Kingdom and retain the same rights and privileges exercised by Commonwealth citizens; Irish citizens remain eligible to vote and stand for parliament in the UK.The British Nationality Act 1948 unintentionally excluded certain British subjects associated with Ireland from acquiring CUKC status. The wording of that law did not take into account the 24-hour period during which Northern Ireland was part of the Irish Free State in 1922. Individuals born before 1922 in the area that became the Republic of Ireland to fathers also born in that area but were domiciled in Northern Ireland on Irish independence had nevertheless automatically acquired Irish citizenship. The Ireland Act 1949 specifically addresses this by deeming any person in such circumstances who had never registered for Irish citizenship and had not permanently resided in the Republic between 10 April 1935 and 1 January 1949 as a CUKC and having never ceased to be a British subject.\n\nRestricting Commonwealth free movement\nAll British subjects under the reformed system initially continued to hold free movement rights in both the UK and Ireland. Non-white immigration into the UK was systemically discouraged, but strong economic conditions in Britain following the Second World War attracted an unprecedented wave of colonial migration. This entitlement was part of a wider initiative to preserve close relationships with certain Dominions and colonies (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and Southern Rhodesia) and to moderate nationalist attitudes within the Commonwealth. In response, Parliament imposed immigration controls on any subjects originating from outside the British Islands with the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962. This restriction was somewhat relaxed by the Immigration Act 1971 for patrials, subjects whose parents or grandparents were born in the United Kingdom, which gave effective preferential treatment to white Commonwealth citizens. Ireland mirrored this restriction and limited free movement only to people born on the islands of Great Britain or Ireland. However, individuals born in the UK since 1983 are only British citizens if at least one parent is already a British citizen. The Irish regulation created a legal anomaly where persons born in Britain without British citizenship nevertheless held an unrestricted right to settle in Ireland; this inconsistency was removed in 1999.In other parts of the Commonwealth, British subjects already did not have an automatic right to settle. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa had immigration restrictions in place for British subjects from outside their jurisdictions targeted at non-white migrants since the late 19th century. After 1949, non-local British subjects under the new definition who were resident in these independent Commonwealth countries continued to retain certain privileges. This included eligibility to vote in elections, for preferred paths to citizenship, and for welfare benefits. British subjects were eligible to vote in New Zealand until 1975 and Australia until 1984 (though subjects on the electoral roll in that year are still eligible). In Canada, voting eligibility was revoked at the federal level in 1975, but not fully phased out in provinces until 2006. All Commonwealth citizens remain eligible to vote and stand for public office in the UK.\n\nPost-imperial redefinition of nationality classes\nBy the 1970s and 1980s, most colonies of the British Empire had become independent and remaining ties to the United Kingdom had been significantly weakened. The UK updated its nationality law to reflect the more modest boundaries of its remaining territory and possessions with the British Nationality Act 1981. CUKCs were reclassified in 1983 into different nationality groups based on their ancestry, birthplace, and immigration status: CUKCs who had right of abode in the United Kingdom became British citizens while those connected with a remaining colony became British Dependent Territories citizens (BDTCs). Remaining CUKCs who were no longer associated with a British territory became British Overseas citizens. The definition of \"British subject\" became limited to include only the category of people previously called British subjects without citizenship who held that status through a connection with former British India or Ireland before 1949.\n\nFormer membership in the European Union\nIn 1973, the United Kingdom joined the European Communities (EC), a set of organisations that later developed into the European Union (EU). British citizens were able to work in other EC/EU countries under the freedom of movement for workers established by the 1957 Treaty of Rome and participated in their first European Parliament elections in 1979. With the creation of European Union citizenship by the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, free movement rights were extended to all nationals of EU member states regardless of their employment status. The scope of these rights was further expanded with the establishment of the European Economic Area in 1994 to include any national of an EFTA member state except for Switzerland, which concluded a separate free movement agreement with the EU that came into force in 2002.Not all British nationals were EU citizens. Only British citizens, British Overseas Territories citizens connected with Gibraltar, and British subjects under the 1981 Act who held UK right of abode were defined as UK nationals for the purposes of EU law. Although the Crown dependencies were part of the European Union Customs Union, free movement of persons was never implemented in those territories. Following the UK's withdrawal from the EU on 31 January 2020, British nationals have no longer been EU citizens. Despite this, British citizens continue to have free movement in Ireland as part of the preexisting arrangement for the Common Travel Area.While the UK was a member state of the EU, Cypriot and Maltese citizens held a particularly favoured status there. While non-EU Commonwealth citizens continued to need a residence visa to live in the UK, Cypriot and Maltese citizens were able to settle there and immediately hold full rights to political participation due to their status as both Commonwealth and EU citizens. This group of EU citizens (along with Irish citizens) domiciled in the UK were able to vote in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum while all other non-British EU citizens could not.\n\nAcquisition and loss of nationality\nBritish citizenship\nPrior to 1983, all Individuals born within the British Islands (the United Kingdom and Crown Dependencies) received British citizenship at birth regardless of the nationalities of their parents. Individuals born afterwards only receive citizenship at birth if at least one parent is a British citizen or considered to have settled status in the UK. Children born overseas are British citizens by descent if either parent is a citizen otherwise than by descent, subject to regulations. Adopted children are treated as if they were naturally born to the adopting parents at the time of adoption. Children born abroad to members of the British Armed Forces or British citizens on Crown service are treated as if they were born in the UK.Children born in the UK to a resident Irish citizen at any time are always British citizens at birth. Since 1983, the status of a child born in the UK is dependent on whether their parents held British citizenship or settled status at the time of their birth. Irish citizens residing in the UK are deemed to hold settled status upon arrival .Regulations concerning settled status for other European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Swiss citizens have changed greatly over time, affecting the status of their children born during the different regulatory periods. EU/EEA citizens living in the UK before 2 October 2000 were automatically considered to be settled. Between that date and 29 April 2006, EU/EEA citizens were required to apply for permanent residency. Swiss citizens became subject to the same regulations on 1 June 2002. From 30 April 2006 until 30 June 2021, EU/EEA and Swiss citizens living in the UK for at least five years automatically received permanent resident status. Permanent resident status for these citizens expired on 1 July 2021, after which they have been required to hold settled status through the European Union Settlement Scheme or another path.Foreign nationals may naturalise as British citizens after residing in the UK for more than five years and possessing indefinite leave to remain (ILR) for at least one year. The residency requirement is reduced to three years if an applicant is married to a British citizen and they immediately become eligible for naturalisation after receiving ILR or equivalent. Applicants must demonstrate proficiency in the English, Welsh, or Scottish Gaelic languages and pass the Life in the United Kingdom test.\n\nBritish Overseas Territories citizenship\nIndividuals born in a territory automatically receive BOTC status if at least one parent is a BOTC or has belonger status. Children born in an overseas territory to British citizen parents who are not settled in a territory are British citizens at birth, but not BOTCs. Parents do not necessarily need to be connected with the same overseas territory to pass on BOTC status. Alternatively, a child born in an overseas territory may be registered as a BOTC if either parent becomes a BOTC or settles in any overseas territory subsequent to birth. A child who lives in the same territory until age 10 and is not absent for more than 90 days in each year is also entitled to registration as a BOTC. Furthermore, an adopted child automatically become a BOTC on the effective day of adoption if either parent is a BOTC or has belonger status. In all cases that an individual is a British Overseas Territories citizen at birth or adoption within the territories, that person is a BOTC otherwise than by descent.Individuals born outside of the territories are BOTCs by descent if either parent is a BOTC otherwise than by descent. Unmarried fathers cannot automatically pass on BOTC status, and it would be necessary for them to register children as BOTCs. If a parent is a BOTC by descent, additional requirements apply to register children as BOTCs. Parents in Crown service who have children abroad are exempted from these circumstances, and their children would be BOTCs otherwise than by descent, as if they had been born on their home territory.Foreigners and non-BOTC British nationals may naturalise as British Overseas Territories citizens after residing in a territory for more than five years and possessing belonger status or permanent residency for more than one year. The residency requirement is reduced to three years if an applicant is married to a BOTC. All applicants for naturalisation and registration are normally considered by the governor of the relevant territory, but the Home Secretary retains discretionary authority to grant BOTC status. Since 2004, BOTC applicants aged 18 or older are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Sovereign and loyalty pledge to the relevant territory during their citizenship ceremonies.All British Overseas Territories citizens other than those solely connected with Akrotiri and Dhekelia became British citizens on 21 May 2002, and children born on qualified overseas territories to dual BOTC-British citizens since that date are both BOTCs and British citizens otherwise than by descent. Prior to 2002, only BOTCs from Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands were given unrestricted access to citizenship. BOTCs naturalised after that date may also become British citizens by registration at the discretion of the Home Secretary. Becoming a British citizen has no effect on BOTC status; BOTCs may also simultaneously be British citizens.\n\nOther nationality classes\nIt is generally not possible to acquire other forms of British nationality. British Overseas citizenship, British subjecthood, and British protected person status are only transferred by descent if an individual born to a parent holding one of these statuses would otherwise be stateless. British Overseas citizens retain their status by association with most former British colonies, British subjects are connected specifically with Ireland or British India before 1949, and British protected persons are associated with territories that were under British control but not formally incorporated as part of the British Empire. British National (Overseas) status was exclusively granted by voluntary registration to Hong Kong residents who had been British Dependent Territories citizens prior to the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997 and cannot be newly acquired in any case. Noncitizen British nationals may become British citizens by registration, rather than naturalisation, after residing in the United Kingdom for more than five years and possessing ILR for more than one year.\n\nRenunciation and restoration\nAny type of British nationality can be renounced by making a declaration to the Home Secretary, provided that the declarant possesses or intends to acquire another nationality. Former British citizens or BOTCs may subsequently apply for nationality restoration. Applicants who had originally renounced their British nationality in order to retain or acquire another nationality are entitled to register as British citizens or BOTCs once. Any subsequent renunciation and application for restoration, or someone applying for restoration who originally renounced their British nationality for a reason unrelated to acquiring or retaining an alternate nationality, would be subject to the discretionary approval of the Home Secretary.\n\nAutomatic loss of British nationality\nBritish subjects (other than British subjects by virtue of a connection with the Republic of Ireland) and British protected persons lose British nationality upon acquiring any other form of nationality.\n\nThese provisions do not apply to British citizens.\nBritish Overseas Territories citizens (BOTCs) who acquire another nationality do not lose their BOTC status but they may be liable to lose belonger status in their home territory under its immigration laws. Such persons are advised to contact the governor of that territory for information.\nBritish Overseas citizens (BOCs) do not lose their BOC status upon acquisition of another citizenship, but any entitlement to registration as a British citizen on the grounds of having no other nationality no longer applies after acquiring another citizenship.\n\nDeprivation of British nationality\nThe British government does not publish the number of people it strips of citizenship, but independent research by a lawyer-run website, in 2022, found at least 464 people's citizenship was revoked in the last 15 years. After the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 came into force British nationals could be deprived of their citizenship if and only if the Secretary of State was satisfied they were responsible for acts seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom or an Overseas Territory.This was extended under the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006: people with dual nationality who are British nationals can be deprived of their British citizenship if the Secretary of State is satisfied that \"deprivation is conducive to the public good\", or if nationality was obtained by means of fraud, false representation or concealment of a material fact. Between 2006 and the end of 2021 at least 464 people have had their citizenship removed by the government since the law was introduced. There is a right of appeal. This provision has been in force since 16 June 2006 when the Immigration, Nationality and Asylum Act 2006 (Commencement No 1) Order 2006 brought it into force. Loss of British nationality in this way applies also to dual nationals who are British by birth. The Secretary of State may not deprive a person of British nationality, unless obtained by means of fraud, false representation or concealment of a material fact, if they are satisfied that the order would make a person stateless.This provision was again modified by the Immigration Act 2014 so as not to require that a third country would actually grant nationality to a person; British nationality can be revoked if \"the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is able, under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom, to become a national of such a country or territory.\"The powers to strip citizenship were initially very rarely used. Between 2010 and 2015, 33 dual nationals had been deprived of their British citizenship. In the two years to 2013 six people were deprived of citizenship; then in 2013, 18 people were deprived, increasing to 23 in 2014. In 2017, over 40 people had been deprived as of July (at this time increased numbers of British citizens went to join \"Islamic State\" and then tried to return).The Home Office does not issue information on these cases and is resistant to answering questions, for example under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. It appears that the government usually waits until the person has left Britain, then sends a warning notice to their British home and signs a deprivation order a day or two later. Appeals are heard at the highly secretive Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC), where the government can submit evidence that cannot be seen or challenged by the appellant.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said in 2018 that until then deprivation of nationality had been restricted to \"terrorists who are a threat to the country\", but that he intended to extend it to \"those who are convicted of the most grave criminal offences\". The acting director of Liberty responded \"The home secretary is taking us down a very dangerous road. ... making our criminals someone else\u2019s problem is ... the government washing its hands of its responsibilities ... Banishment belongs in the dark ages.\"A Nationality and Borders Bill was introduced to the British House of Commons in July 2021, sponsored by the Home Office under Home Secretary Priti Patel. In November 2021, an amendment to the Bill was introduced which, if passed, would allow people to be deprived of British citizenship without being given notice. At the time the Home Office reiterated its position on citizenship: \"British citizenship is a privilege, not a right\".\n\nBritish citizenship ceremonies\nFrom 1 January 2004, all new applicants for British citizenship by naturalisation or registration aged 18 or over if their application is successful must attend a citizenship ceremony and either make an affirmation or take an oath of allegiance to the monarch, and make a pledge to the UK.\nCitizenship ceremonies are normally organised by:\n\nlocal councils in England, Scotland, and Wales\nthe Northern Ireland Office\nthe governments of the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey\nthe Governors of British Overseas Territories\nBritish consular offices outside the United Kingdom and territories.Persons from what is now the Republic of Ireland born before 1949 reclaiming British subject status under section 31 of the 1981 Act do not need to attend a citizenship ceremony. If such a person subsequently applies for British citizenship by registration or naturalisation, attendance at a ceremony is required.\nFor those who applied for British citizenship before 2004:\n\nthe oath of allegiance was administered privately through signing a witnessed form in front of a solicitor or other accredited person\nthose who already held British nationality (other than British protected persons) were exempt, as were those citizens of countries with the King as Head of State (such as Australia and Canada).\n\nSee also\nVisa policy of the United Kingdom\nVisa requirements for British citizens\nVisa requirements for British Nationals (Overseas)\nVisa requirements for British Overseas citizens\nVisa requirements for British Overseas Territories citizens\n\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nPangi Territory\nPangi Territory is an administrative area in Maniema Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The  headquarters is the town of Pangi.\nThe Elila River flows through Pangi territory, entering the Lualaba River to the west.\nThe territory is divided into the Babene chiefdom and the Beia, Ikama, Wakabango and Wasongola sectors.\nMost of the territory is inhabited by the Lega people, as are the adjoining Mwenga and Shabunda territories.\nAs of 1972 there were still a few Pygmies living among the Baziri tribe of Lega people.\nBefore independence the territory had 97,380 inhabitants of whom 35,518 were in urban and mining agglomerations.\nPassage 3:\nLove and War in the Apennines\nLove and War in the Apennines is a 1971 Second World War memoir (with some changes of names and people and places, and some composite characters) by Eric Newby. In the United States the title was changed to When the Snow Comes, They Will Take You Away. It was dramatised as the 2001 film In Love and War starring Callum Blue and Barbora Bobu\u013eov\u00e1.\n\nOverview\nAfter the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces in 1943, the author left the prisoner-of-war camp in which he had been held for a year, PG 49 at Fontanellato, and evaded the Germans by going to ground high in the mountains and forests south of the Po River. In enforced isolation, he was sheltered and protected by an informal and highly courageous network of Italian peasants. Newby writes a powerful account of these idiosyncratic and selfless people and also of their bleak and very basic lifestyle. He undergoes a series of bizarre, funny and often dangerous incidents, and in the process meets Wanda, a local girl who later becomes his wife.\n\nSummary\nNewby takes part in a Special Boat Service operation on the east coast of Sicily. He and his colleagues fail to make their rendezvous with a British submarine and are picked up by a fishing boat.\nNewby is imprisoned in an orphanage at Fontanellato in the Po valley. With the Armistizio, the Italians let the English prisoners escape. Because Newby has a broken ankle he is abandoned and is hidden in a farmer's hay loft until an Italian doctor takes him to the hospital. Here he is visited by Wanda, the daughter of a Slovene teacher, who gives him Italian lessons in exchange for English lessons and they fall in love. The Germans discover he is there but Newby escapes and hides, moving from one house to another.\nNewby is nearly captured and moves into the mountains to stay with a shepherd; villagers build him a camouflaged cave. Further exciting adventures follow, and a meeting with Wanda.\n\nReception\nThe New York Times wrote of Love and War that \"His memoir of that time became one of his most acclaimed books\".The novelist Simon Mawer, writing on the NPR website, describes the book as follows:\nRead the book and you are there in the Italian mountains with him: You can feel the stony soil, smell the wood smoke in the air, sense the snow on the wind. He conjures up the stubborn, fatalistic, bloody-minded locals who risked their lives for him so vividly that they seem to be standing in front of you. You share his fears and his hopes. He makes you laugh and he makes you weep. It's quite an achievement for an author commonly labeled as a travel writer. \u2014 Simon Mawer\nTravel writer John Gimlette, writing in The Guardian, comments that \"For sheer charm, there's nothing quite like Eric Newby's Love and War in the Apennines.\" He adds that while it is plainly a celebration of Italy, \"At a more profound level, it's a beautifully philanthropic yet unsentimental work. However miserable the times and awkward the place, Newby's characters are usually endearing, and often complex.\"\n\nSources\nLove and War in the Apennines, Picador (1983) ISBN 978-0-330-28024-2\nPassage 4:\nEssex County Park Commission Administration Building\nThe Essex County Park Commission Administration Building is located in Newark, Essex County, New Jersey, United States.

He made his first team debut in 2009, and was the man of the match as they won the FA Cup in 2013. In January 2015, he joined West Bromwich Albion for \u00a34.75 million.\nOn 13 October 2020, McManaman signed a two-year contract with A-League club Melbourne Victory ahead of the 2020\u201321 A-League season. In June 2023, he rejoined Wigan Athletic for his third spell at the club.\n\nClub career\nWigan Athletic\nMcManaman was born in Huyton. He grew up as an Everton supporter, and joined the club's youth system when he was seven years old. After being released by the club at the age of sixteen, he signed for Wigan Athletic on a free transfer in 2007. He made his debut for the reserves toward the end of the 2007\u201308 season. He became a regular in the reserve team during the second half of the following season, appearing ten times and scoring four goals. He then made his first team debut on 24 May 2009 in a Premier League match against Portsmouth, becoming Wigan's youngest-ever player to play in the Premier League.In July 2009, he signed his first professional contract with the club. McManaman remained in the reserve team during the 2009\u201310 season, scoring twice in a 5\u20130 win against Burnley. Although he did not appear in the first team, he earned a contract extension.McManaman was an unused substitute in the first team at the start of the 2010\u201311 season, but Wigan manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez felt the player was not yet ready for Premier League football. On 30 November 2010, he made his first appearance in over 18 months when he came on as a substitute in a League Cup match against Arsenal. Mart\u00ednez suggested the player would feature more regularly later in the season. He scored his first goal for Wigan in his first start for the club against Hull City in the FA Cup on 8 January 2011. In April 2011, he extended his contract for a further two years, keeping him at the club until 2013.On 17 October 2011, McManaman joined Blackpool in a three-month loan deal. He made his debut a day later, appearing as a substitute against Doncaster Rovers, and made his first start for the club in the following game against Nottingham Forest. On 3 December 2011, he scored his first league goal in a 1\u20130 win against Reading.\nAfter he returned from his loan spell at Blackpool, McManaman scored against Swindon Town in the FA Cup on 7 January 2012. He returned to Premier League football at the DW Stadium on 16 January 2012 as an 81st-minute substitute in a single-goal defeat to Manchester City.McManaman scored as a substitute in the 89th minute in Wigan's first League Cup game of the 2012\u201313 season, capping off a 1\u20134 win over Nottingham Forest. In January 2013, he signed a new contract with Wigan until 2016. On 17 February 2013, in the fifth round of the FA Cup, McManaman scored one goal and was named man-of-the-match in a 4\u20131 win against Huddersfield Town, helping Wigan reach the quarter-finals for the first time in 26 years. In that quarter-final match, he scored against his former club Everton, at Goodison Park, in a 3\u20130 win that sent Wigan to the semi-finals at Wembley.After the Everton game, McManaman made his first Premier League start against Newcastle United on 17 March 2013. His challenge on Massadio Ha\u00efdara in that game was the subject of a two-day review by The Football Association; the Association concluded it lacked the authority to penalise McManaman retrospectively. On 23 March 2013, The Daily Telegraph reported that the McManaman situation had prompted the FA \"... to raise the issue with the other 'stakeholders' involved in setting disciplinary guidelines ... at the end of the season.\"On 27 April 2013, he scored his first Premier League goal for Wigan in a 2\u20132 draw against Tottenham Hotspur. A week later, he scored the winning goal in a 3\u20132 win against West Bromwich Albion. On 11 May, he was named man-of-the-match in the FA Cup Final, leading Wigan to a 1\u20130 victory over Manchester City.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion\nOn 28 January 2015, McManaman signed for Premier League club West Bromwich Albion on a three-and-a-half-year contract for \u00a34.75 million. He was the first signing for the club by Tony Pulis.On 27 December 2016, McManaman signed for Championship club Sheffield Wednesday on loan for the remainder of the season. He played in their first match of 2017 against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 2 January.\n\nSunderland\nMcManaman signed for Championship club Sunderland on 31 August 2017 on a two-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He scored his first goal for Sunderland with a 96th-minute equaliser in a 3\u20133 draw with Middlesbrough on 24 February 2018.\n\nReturn to Wigan Athletic\nOn 20 July 2018, McManaman returned to his boyhood club Wigan Athletic for an undisclosed fee, signing onto a one-year rolling contract.\n\nLuton Town\nOn 4 June 2019, McManaman signed for newly promoted Championship club Luton Town on a free transfer. He was released at the end of the 2019\u201320 season.\n\nMelbourne Victory\nOn 13 October 2020, McManaman signed a two-year contract with A-League club Melbourne Victory ahead of the 2020\u201321 A-League season. In July 2021, he was released by Melbourne Victory, with one-year left on his contract.\n\nTranmere Rovers\nOn 9 July, it was announced that McManaman had made a return to English football, signing with League Two side Tranmere Rovers on a one-year deal. McManaman was released at the end of the 2021\u201322 season.\n\nThird spell at Wigan Athletic\nOn 30 June 2023, McManaman returned to League One side Wigan Athletic for a third spell in his career, signing a one-year deal.\n\nInternational career\nMcManaman is available to represent England and the Republic of Ireland, through Irish ancestry.In June 2011, McManaman, along with teammate Lee Nicholls, was included in the England under-20s squad for the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup, the first time a Wigan Athletic player has been involved in the tournament. He made his debut in a group match \u2013 a 0\u20130 draw against North Korea, and went on to play in all of England's games during the tournament before the team were knocked out by Nigeria.\nOn 14 May, he was called up for the first time to the England Under 21s for the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship in Israel. However, he was ruled out of the tournament due to an ankle injury picked up in a game against Arsenal on the same day.\n\nPersonal life\nMcManaman is a distant relative of former Liverpool, Real Madrid, Manchester City and England player Steve McManaman.\n\nCareer statistics\nAs of end of 2021\u201322 season\n\nHonours\nWigan Athletic\n\nFA Cup: 2012\u201313\nPassage 7:\nMinsk Region\nMinsk Region, also known as Minsk Oblast or Minsk Voblasts (Belarusian: \u041c\u0456\u0301\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0301\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0446\u044c, romanized: Minskaja voblas\u0107, IPA: [\u02c8m\u02b2inskaja \u02c8vob\u026bas\u02b2ts\u02b2]; Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0301\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c, romanized: Minskaya oblast), is one of the regions of Belarus. Its administrative center is Minsk, although it is a separate administrative territorial entity of Belarus. As of 2011, the region's population is 1,411,500.\n\nGeography\nMinsk Region covers a total of 39,900 km2, about 19.44% of the national total area. Lake Narach, the largest lake in the country, is located in the northern part of the region. There are four other large lakes in this region: Svir (8th largest), Myadel (11th largest), Syalyava (14th largest) and Myastro (15th largest). It is the only region of Belarus whose border is not part of the international border of Belarus.\n\nHistory\nBeginning the 10th century, the territory of the current Minsk Region was part of Kievan Rus', the Principality of Polotsk, and later it was included in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. With the unification of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, the territory became part of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nIn 1793, as a result of the second partition of Polish territory, the area was annexed by Russia as the Minsk Region. During the collapse of the Russian Empire due to the Civil War, the western part was annexed to Poland in 1921, while the east became Soviet Belarus.\nThe Minsk region was established on 15 January 1938, based on the amendment of the Constitutional Law of the USSR. As of 20 February 1938, the area included 20 districts.  Following the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 17, 1939, the former Eastern lands of the Second Polish Republic were annexed in accordance with the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact partitioning Poland and added to the Minsk Region.\nOn 20 September 1944, by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Gressky, Kopyl, Krasnoslobodski, Luban, Slutsky, Starobin, Starodorozhski districts and the city of Sluck were removed from the Minsk region and transferred to the newly formed Bobruisk Region.\nOn 8 January 1954, by the decree of the USSR Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the Nesvizhski and Stolbtsovsky districts from the abolished Baranovichi Region, as well as the Glusk, Gressky, Kopyl, Krasnoslobodski, Luban, Slutsky, Starobin, Starodorozhski districts and the city of Sluck from the abolished Bobruisk Region, were added to the Minsk Region.\nIn 1960, following the abolition of Molodechno Region, its southern part became the northern part of the Minsk Region.\n\nTourism\nThe number of travel agencies in Minsk Region grew from twelve in 2000 to seventy in 2010. The most popular tourist destinations of the region are Zaslavskoye Lake, the Zhdanovichi area which has health resorts, Nesvizh Palace and its surroundings, as well as the alpine ski resorts of Logoysk and Silichi.\n\nAdministrative subdivisions\nThe Minsk Region comprises 22 districts (raions), 307 selsovets, 22 cities, 8 city municipalities, and 20 urban-type settlements.\n\nDistricts of Minsk Region\nCities and towns\nPopulation of cities and towns in Minsk Region\n\nDemographics\nSee also\nAdministrative divisions of Belarus\nVillages in Minsk Region\nPassage 8:\nList of territorial entities where English is an official language\nThe following is a list of countries and territories where English is an official language\u2014that is, a language used in citizen interactions with government officials. As of 2020, there were 58 sovereign states and 28 non-sovereign entities where English was an official language. Many administrative divisions have declared English an official language at the local or regional level.\nMost states where English is an official language are former territories of the British Empire. Exceptions include Rwanda and Burundi, which were formerly German and then Belgian colonies; Cameroon, where only part of national territory was under British mandate; and Liberia, the Philippines, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, which were American territories. English is the sole official language of the Commonwealth of Nations and of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). English is one of the official languages of the United Nations, the European Union, NAFTA, the African Union, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Caribbean Community, the Union of South American Nations, and many other international organisations. Although English is not de jure an official language at the national level in the United States, most states and territories within the United States have English as an official language, and only Puerto Rico uses a language other than English as a primary working language.The United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, where the overwhelming majority of native English speakers reside, do not have English as an official language de jure, but English is considered their de facto official language because it dominates in these countries.\n\nSovereign states\nCountries where English is a de jure official language\nCountries where English is a predominant language conventionally spoken by both the government and main population, despite it having no de jure official status at national level\nCountries where English is a de facto working language in government or education, but it is not recognized as de jure official, nor a primary language spoken by the main population\nNon-sovereign entities\nNon-sovereign entities where English is a de jure official language\nNon-sovereign entities where English is a de facto official language\nNon-sovereign entities where English is a de facto official, but not a primary language\nCountry subdivisions\nIn these country subdivisions, English has de jure official status, but English is not official in their respective countries at the national level.\n\nSee also\nEnglish-only movement\nAnglo-America\nCommonwealth of Nations\nMember states of the Commonwealth of Nations\nBritish Overseas Territories\nEnglish-speaking world\nList of countries by English-speaking population\nList of languages by total number of speakers\nBritish Empire\n\nFootnotes\nPassage 9:\nWhiston, Merseyside\nWhiston is a town and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley in Merseyside, England. Previously recorded within the historic county of Lancashire, it is located eight miles (ten kilometres) east of Liverpool. The population was 13,629 at the 2001 Census, increasing to 14,263 at the 2011 Census.A new village, Halsnead Garden Village, was approved with government support in 2017 and will be located in the Halsnead area of the town. The new village will contain over 1,500 houses, a primary school, a country park, and various community and leisure facilities. Construction is estimated to cost around \u00a3270 million.\n\nHistory\nThe first record of Whiston comes in 1245, being rendered as \"Quistan\" and being within the West Derby Hundred in Lancashire. Archeological evidence such as a neolithic polished hand-axe and mesolithic tool fragments suggest that the region was host to pre-historic settlement up to 12,000 years, ago while other archaeological finds include remnants of a Roman tile workshop in nearby Tarbock and a medieval shovel head.The main industry of Whiston's earlier documented history is agriculture, with the first recorded mill in the area being held by local lord Henry Travers from 1190. By 1521, the first documentation of coal mining is made, which would in time become Whiston's primary industry. By 1700, the coalfields of Whiston, Prescot, and Sutton were producing 25,000-50,000 tonnes of coal annually, and this would only increase as the Industrial Revolution progressed and the Whiston area became host to tens of collieries over the 18th and 19th Centuries.The Church of St. Nicholas on Windy Arbor Road was consecrated on 30 July 1868. It hosts a war memorial, designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, which was struck by lightning in 1928. The memorial was replaced in 1932.Whiston was previously host to Halsnead Hall, a neoclassical manor that housed the Willis family, chief landholders in Whiston from 1684 until the auctioning of their estate in 1929. Halsnead Hall, demolished in 1932 and now the site of Halsnead static caravan park, was designed by the renowned architect Sir John Soane. Before its demolition, it was the sole example of Soane's work in either Lancashire or Cheshire.\n\nGovernance\nPrior to boundary changes in 2016, Whiston consisted of the Whiston North and Whiston South wards of the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley. The North and South wards were separated by the Liverpool to Manchester Railway, which runs directly through the town. The former borough wards of North and South are still used in the form of Town Council wards, but for the purposes of Borough representation, Whiston elects three councillors via the combined ward of Whiston and Cronton.Whiston lent its name to and was formerly the headquarters of the Whiston Rural District within the County of Lancashire before the Local Government Act 1972. Today, Whiston Town Council oversees parish level administration.\n\nTransport\nWhiston is crossed by the historic Liverpool to Manchester Railway, and is served by Whiston railway station with services to Liverpool and Manchester, operated by Northern. Local bus routes to Runcorn, Liverpool, St Helens and Huyton also serve the town. These are operated by, among other smaller local providers, Stagecoach and Arriva.\n\nHealth\nSt Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust operates Whiston Hospital. The hospital supports the primary maternity department for the Knowsley and St Helens boroughs, alongside a regional Burns and Plastic Surgery Unit serving North West England, North Wales and the Isle of Man. The Trust is a member organisation of the teaching hospital system partnered with the University of Liverpool, Liverpool John Moores University and Edge Hill University.\n\nIndustries\nLocal industry includes Glen Dimplex Home Appliances, producing kitchen appliances and employing approximately 1,000 people.\n\nEducation\nPrimary education\nSt Luke's Catholic Primary School\nHalsnead Primary School\nWhiston Willis Primary School\nSt Leo's & Southmead Catholic Primary School\n\nSecondary education\nIn 2010, two of Whiston's secondary schools were closed and redeveloped under the Labour Party governments 'Building Schools for the Future' scheme. This \u00a3150 million programme created seven new 'Centres for Learning' to replace the ten existing secondary schools within the Knowsley borough.\nKnowsley Higher Side Comprehensive School, Cumber Lane.Constructed in 1964, Knowsley Higher Side Comprehensive School was one of the first comprehensive schools in the local area, purpose built under the Labour Party's education reforms to formally abolish the tripartite system of education; to amalgamate grammar, technical and secondary modern schools into one appropriately named Comprehensive System. \nIn March 2010, after serving the local area for 46 years, Higher Side Comprehensive School was permanently closed and subsequently demolished to make way for the new St Edmund Arrowsmith Catholic Centre for Learning which was constructed on vacant land behind Higher Side's main buildings. The land on which Higher Side once stood now serves as a car park and recreational area for staff and pupils of the new St Edmund Arrowsmith.\nThe only remaining building of the former Higher Side School site is the former Whiston & Prescot City Learning Centre (CLC), now St Edmund Arrowsmith Science Hub. The building was originally constructed and opened in 2000. Pupils of the school who were still enrolled at Higher Side at the time its closure were transferred to its replacement Knowsley Park Centre for Learning (now The Prescot School) based on Knowsley Park Lane, Prescot.\n\nSt Edmund Arrowsmith Catholic Academy, Whiston, Cumber Lane.Closed, relocated and rebuilt behind the former Knowsley Higher Side Comprehensive School on Cumber Lane.

Each of the 36 states is a semi-autonomous political unit that shares powers with the federal government as enumerated under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Federal Capital Territory (FCT), is the capital territory of Nigeria, and it is in this territory that the capital city of Abuja is located. The FCT is not a state but is administered by elected officials who are supervised by the federal government. Each state is subdivided into local government areas (LGAs). There are 774 local governments in Nigeria. Under the constitution, the 36 states are co-equal but not supreme because sovereignty resides with the federal government. The constitution can be amended by the National Assembly, but each amendment must be ratified by two-thirds of the 36 states of the federation.\n\nCurrent states and the Federal Capital Territory\nEvolution of Nigerian states\nGovernment\nStates of Nigeria have the right to organize and structure their individual governments in any way within the parameters set by the Constitution of Nigeria.\n\nLegislature\nAt the state level, the legislature is unicameral, with the number of its members equal to three times the number of legislators it has in the Federal House of Representatives. It has the power to legislate on matters on the concurrent list.\n\nExecutive\nAt the state level, the head of the executive is the governor, who has the power to appoint people to the state executive council, subject to the advice and consent of the state house of assembly (legislature). The head of a ministry at the state level is the commissioner, who is assisted by a permanent secretary, who is also a senior civil servant of the state.\n\nJudiciary\nThe Judiciary is one of the co-equal arms of the state government concerned with the interpretation of the laws of the state government. The judiciary is headed by the chief justice of the state appointed by the governor subject to the approval of the state house of assembly.\n\nChronology\nSee also\nList of Nigerian states by population\nISO 3166-2:NG\nList of state governors of Nigeria\n\nNotes\nSources\nGboyega Ajayi (2007).

It is located next to the ruins of Emp\u00faries or Emp\u00f2rion. Ancient Greeks established the settlement in the 6th century BC. It was the county seat until 1079 Emp\u00faries moved to Castell\u00f3 d'Emp\u00faries place less exposed to attack.\nSant Mart\u00ed d'Emp\u00faries is a staging point on the GR 92 long distance footpath, which roughly follows the length of the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Stage 5, to the north, takes a route behind the coast to the El Cortalet pond in the Parc Natural dels Aiguamolls de l'Empord\u00e0, a distance of 20.2 kilometres (12.6 mi). Stage 6, to the south, follows the coast to l'Escala and then takes an inland route across the Montgri Massif to reach the next staging point of Torroella de Montgr\u00ed, a distance of 20.0 kilometres (12.4 mi).\n\nHistory\nIt was an inhabited place since the arrival of Greeks from Massalia, actual Marseille (France) in the 6th century BC. Greeks established a settlement there called it, Kypsela (Greek: \u039a\u03cd\u03c8\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1). At the ancient times there is a possibility that there was a temple of Artemis on the island.It was Christianized by Saint Feliu, an African martyr who died in 304 in Girona. He was bishop between 516 and 693. Charlemagne mentions Ermenguer as first Count of Emp\u00faries in 812.\nPassage 12:\nCyprus Popular Bank\nCyprus Popular Bank (from 2006 to 2011 known as Marfin Popular Bank) was the second-largest banking group in Cyprus behind the Bank of Cyprus until it was 'shuttered' in March 2013 and split into two parts. The 'good' Cypriot part was merged into the Bank of Cyprus (including insured deposits under 100,000 Euro) and the 'bad' part or legacy entity holds all the overseas operations as well as uninsured deposits above 100,000 Euro, old shares and bonds. The uninsured depositors were subject to a bail-in and became the new shareholders of the legacy entity.  As at May 2017, the legacy entity is one of the largest shareholders of Bank of Cyprus with 4.8% but does not hold a board seat. All the overseas operations, of the now defunct Cyprus Popular Bank, are also held by the legacy entity, until they are sold by the Special Administrator, at first Ms Andri Antoniadou, who ran the legacy entity for two years, from March 2013 until 3 March 2015. She tendered her resignation due to disagreements, with the Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Central Bank Board members, who amended the lawyers of the legacy entity, without consulting her. Veteran banker Chris Pavlou who is an expert in Treasury and risk management took over as Special Administrator of the legacy entity in April 2015 until December 2016. The legacy entity is pursuing legal action against former major shareholder Marfin Investment Group.\nIts shares were listed on the Cyprus Stock Exchange and the Athens Stock Exchange. CPB had a network of more than 295 branches in Cyprus, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, the UK and Malta. The bank had applied to open a representative office in Beijing, People's Republic of China.Trading on the island as Laiki Bank (Laiki being the Greek word for Popular), as of September 2012 it held a 16% share of the market in loans and a 14.4% share of deposits.  The Bank made a series of large loans, many to Greek companies prior to and during their financial crisis. What followed has been described as \"billions handed out in bad loans created a financial time-bomb\". After the bank collapsed, it was rescued by the Cypriot government, which took 84% ownership on 30 June 2012 and as of March 2013 it is being dismantled as part of the 2012\u20132013 Cypriot financial crisis.\n\nHistory\nIn 1901, four leading citizens of Limassol\u2014Agathoclis Francoudis, Ioannis Kyriakides, Christodoulos Sozos and Neoklis Ioannides\u2014established the Popular Savings Bank of Limassol to encourage saving among the workforce. More than two decades later, in 1924, the bank changed its name from the Popular Savings Bank of Limassol to the Popular Bank of Limassol. The bank also became the first company in Cyprus to register as a public-traded company.\nThen in 1967, the Popular Bank of Limassol changed its name to Cyprus Popular Bank (CPB) to reflect the bank\u2019s expansion beyond Limassol. Expansion beyond Limassol followed quickly, with the establishment of its first branches in Nicosia,  Famagusta (1969), and Paphos and Larnaca (1970). Also in 1970, Midland Bank acquired 22% of the company's shares, making Midland a major shareholder in CPB. The next year CPB relocated its headquarters from Limassol to Nicosia.\n\n1974 CPB established its first London branch.\n1983 CPB acquired all the Cyprus operations of Grindlays Bank located in the area under government control.\n1992 CPB opened the first branch of European Popular Bank in Athens. CPB owned 58% of the shares of the bank; other shareholders included HSBC (formerly Midland Bank) and Greek and Cypriot investors. CPB retained branches in Heraklion and Thessaloniki\n1995 CPB opened its first representative offices in South Africa and in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n1996 CPB opened its first representative offices in Australia.\n1997 CPB opened its first representative offices in Serbia and in Russia (\"Rosprombank\")\n1998 CPB establishes a representative office in New York. (NY State Banking Dept says State chartered).\n2000 The Cyprus Popular Bank Group changed its name to Laiki Group.\n2001 The Laiki Group established a subsidiary in Australia with five branches.\n2005 The Group established Laiki Bank (Guernsey), and purchased Bank Centrobank in Serbia.\n2006 The Greek Marfin Investment Group acquired HSBC's shares in Laiki Bank, establishing a strong minority share position.  Subsequently, the Marfin Investment Group through more acquisitions managed to take control of Laiki Bank, which it re-branded as Marfin Popular Bank.  In Greece, the Marfin Group consolidated Egnatia, Laiki and Marfin to form Marfin Egnatia Bank, which is the 95%-owned Greek subsidiary of Marfin Popular Bank.\n2007 The bank announced the planned takeover of 50.12% of the share capital of AS SBM Pank, a bank in Estonia.MPB also acquired 99.2% of the shares of Marine Transport Bank Ukraine for US$156 million. This bank was founded in 1993 as Marine Trade Bank and changed its name to Marine Transport Bank in 1996. It has its headquarters in the Odesa region and has 86 branches.\nLastly, MPB acquired 43% of the share capital of Lombard Bank Malta for \u20ac48 million from Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI) of Lugano. CPB now holds c. 49% of Lombard Bank Malta.In 2007, the bank announced a multi-million financial deal to sponsor the football First Division in Cyprus until 2010.\n2008 Marfin Popular Bank completed its acquisition of 50.4% of the shares of CJSC RPB Holding, parent company of the Rossisysky Promishlenny Bank (Rosprombank), for \u20ac83 million. The acquisition makes Marfin the first Greek or Cypriot bank to acquire control of a bank in Russia.\nIn 2010, they launched a new mobile banking and mobile trading service. In the same year, the company was selected as the bank of the year in Cyprus by the Banker.\n2010 MPB sold 85% of Laiki Bank Australia to Bank of Beirut. The Australian bank received a new name, Beirut Hellenic Bank. At the time, the bank had a branch in Adelaide, four branches in Melbourne and five branches in Sydney.\n2011 MPB sold the majority of its shareholding in its Estonian subsidiary and returned to its historic name of Cyprus Popular Bank (CPB).\nIn 2012 CPB converted its Greek subsidiary into a branch of the parent bank.\nThe 2012\u20132013 Cypriot financial crisis resulted in financial difficulties at CPB. The Cypriot state recapitalized CPB on 30 June 2012 with the result that the government acquired 84% of the bank's equity. This increased the bank's core tier 1 capital ratio towards 9%, the level mandated by the European Banking Authority.\nIn early 2013 CPB renamed its Greek branches to CPB Bank and on 26 March the bank sold them to Piraeus Bank. Laiki was split into a good and bad bank, the good bank (Cyprus operations) merged with Bank of Cyprus and the bad bank is in the process of being sold and finally shuttered. The board and CEO were replaced on 27 March. The bad bank was being run by a Special Administrator Ms Andri Antoniadou who was acting CEO until 3 March 2015. Veteran banker Chris Pavlou took over as Special Administrator in April 2015 until December 2016.In 2018 European Court dismisses compensation claim in Cyprus 2013 deposit-grab.\nPassage 13:\nDunbar Hospital\nThe Dunbar Hospital was the first hospital for the black community in Detroit, Michigan. It is located at 580 Frederick Street, and is currently the administrative headquarters of the Detroit Medical Society. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\n\nBuilding construction and description\nThe building housing the Dunbar Hospital was built in 1892 by the Guy W. Vinton Company as a home for real estate developer Charles W. Warren. The home was constructed in a fashionable 19th century residential district.The structure is a three-story home of mixed Romanesque Revival and Queen Anne style, built of red brick and rough-cut ashlar. The entrance is through a recessed, arched first-floor porch and the second story has a double-arch brick balcony. The roof is slate, with a bay-windowed gabled dormer surmounting the front fa\u00e7ade.\n\nFounding of the Dunbar Hospital\nIn 1894, Dr. James W. Ames, a graduate of both Straight University and Howard University, arrived in Detroit after a stint of teaching in New Orleans. He quickly became influential in both Detroit's white community and its then-small black community. Detroit's mayor at the time was Hazen Pingree. During his subsequent re-election campaign, Pingree actively courted the black vote, in part by supporting Ames's bid for election to the Michigan state legislature.The nationally famous black poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, popular in both the black and white community, visited Detroit and lent his voice to those supporting Pingree, penning the poem, \"Vote for Pingree and Vote for Bread.\" Both Ames and Pingree won their respective elections, and Ames spent the next two years in the legislature. He was the last black elected until the 1920s.Two decades later, in the years following World War I, the black population of Detroit soared. In 1910, fewer than 6000 blacks called the city home; in 1917 more than 30,000 blacks lived in Detroit. The increase in black residents led to a crisis in health care. Hospitals were still segregated, and physicians like Ames were required to ask permission to admit black patients. Often black patients were simply denied care. The increase in the black population threatened to overwhelm the city's 30 black doctors.In 1918, Ames led the group of 30 black physicians to form the Allied Medical Society. The area around Frederick street was at the cusp of becoming the center of social and cultural life for Detroit's black community, and the AMS purchased the Warren home on Frederick They opened their own non-profit hospital in the building, the first in the city to serve the black community, as well as an associated nursing school. The hospital was named for the poet Dunbar, who had died in 1906. The hospital had 27 beds and an operating room.\n\nLater history\nIn 1928, demand led Dunbar Hospital to move from its first home to a larger facility several blocks to the east. The facility was renamed Parkside Hospital, and continued in operation until 1962. Soon after Dunbar moved from its home on Frederick, Charles Diggs Sr., who was later the first African-American Democratic state senator, purchased the home. Diggs's son, Charles C. Diggs Jr., served in the Michigan State Senate from 1951 to 1954 and the U.S. House of Representatives from 1954 to 1980. In 1978, the Detroit Medical Society (the successor to the Allied Medical Society) purchased and restored the building. It now serves as their administrative headquarters and a museum.",

As an amateur, he competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Francisco is also the brother of amateur boxer, Angel Bojado.\n\nAmateur career\nHe compiled an amateur record of 168\u201315 and represented Mexico at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.Francisco lost in the second qualifying round at the games. He returned home with his eyes set on turning professional. Shortly after, he was signed by Shelly Finkel, a man who also managed Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson, among many others. Finkel soon helped Bojado sign a multi-fight deal with cable television channel Showtime.\n\nProfessional career\nOn January 13, 2001, he made his professional debut by beating Derrick Castor by knockout in the second round in Uncasville, Connecticut. He followed that victory with eight more knockout wins, including wins over veterans Mauro Lucero, Glenn Forde and Eleazar Contreras. But on February 16, 2002, also in Uncasville, he was upset by Juan Carlos Rubio, who beat him by a ten-round decision. He would later avenge the loss to Rubio, by 12-round decision.\nOn January 24, 2004, Francisco defeated experienced Emmanuel Clottey in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\nOn July 24, however, he suffered another setback, when former world Jr. Lightweight champion Jesse James Leija beat him by a split ten-round decision. He walked away from the sport following the loss.In April 2007, Bojado signed a deal with promotional company Golden Boy Promotions, and made his return to the ring on May 4, 2007, against Dairo Esalas at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Bojado won a unanimous decision.On October 6, 2007, Stephen Forbes won a split-decision upset over Bojado in a junior welterweight bout.\n\nOutside the ring\nBojado made an appearance on the HBO short series De La Hoya/Mayweather 24/7 as a sparring partner for Oscar De La Hoya.\nBojado was arrested in 2011 after allegedly failing to stop at US Border security, which resulted in shots being fired at him by police.In 2013 Bojado got back into the ring and started training.\n\nProfessional record\nPassage 3:\nGibbs Point\nGibbs Point, a rock point on the Antarctic Peninsula, the most northern area of the continent of Antarctica, was named for African American Antarctic explorer, George W. Gibbs, Jr. on September 2, 2009. On that date, the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (U.S. Board on Geographic Names) confirmed the place name in Antarctica for Gibbs as the first black explorer to set foot on the continent. Gibbs Point is a rock point forming the northwest entrance to Gaul Cove, on the northeast of Horseshoe Island, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula.\nPassage 4:\nDavid Melgueiro\nDavid Melgueiro (? in Porto \u2013 1673 in Porto?) is alleged to have been a Portuguese navigator and explorer. He allegedly sailed across the Northeast Passage in 1660 by travelling from Japan to Portugal through the Arctic Ocean at a time when Portuguese vessels were banned from Japan. The story is considered to be a falsehood, with obvious factual errors in the account of the voyage and no historical evidence to support it or even confirm Melgueiro's existence.\n\nAlleged voyage\nAccording to the story of a diplomat and French spy in Portugal, the Seigneur de La Madel\u00e8ne (or Madeleine), he found records that a Captain David Melgueiro left the island of Tanegashima, Japan (Kagoshima Prefecture) at the command of the ship le P\u00e8re \u00e9ternel on March 14, 1660, sailed north along the east coast of Asia to 84\u00b0 N. The ship then sailed between Svalbard and Greenland towards Scotland and Ireland, passing west of them to finally arrive at Porto.La Madel\u00e8ne was allegedly murdered when he was preparing to leave Portugal to reveal Melgueiro's achievement to the French. In 1754 the French geographer Philippe Buache traced in his memoirs the route taken by Melgueiro on a 1649 map drawn by a Portuguese identified only as Teixeira. The map was found in the French Navy archives. How the French Navy acquired this map would be a Portuguese state secret as well.\n\nAppraisal of veracity\nWilliam Corr dismisses the story by saying that \"no Portuguese vessels sailed, or could have sailed, from Japan in 1660; Portuguese commerce with Japan ended drastically in 1639.\" The Portuguese were expelled and under the Sakoku isolationist policy all trade and contact with the outside world stopped except for very limited trade by the Dutch.\nIn his account of the expedition of the Vega, Adolf Erik Nordenski\u00f6ld mentions Melgueiro's alleged voyage briefly but dismisses it as obvious fiction, noting that the only detail found in the account\u2014namely that the coast of Tartary extends to 84\u00b0N\u2014is false. The northernmost point on the Eurasian coast is Cape Chelyuskin at 77\u00b044'N. Including islands, the northernmost point of Eurasia is Cape Fligely at 81\u00b050'N. The northernmost point of land on Earth is a matter of some dispute, but all contenders lie off the coast of Greenland at approximately 83\u00b040'N.\nEduardo Bras\u00e3o described the supposed voyage as a historical fantasy and noted that there is no historical evidence of the ship in question departing from Kagoshima on the alleged date nor of any Portuguese person bearing the name \"David Melgueiro\".\n\nLegacy\nA nautical Portuguese scientific project took Melgueiro's name: Associa\u00e7\u00e3o David Melgueiro.\n\nSee also\nVega Expedition by Adolf Erik Nordenski\u00f6ld, the first  Arctic expedition to navigate through the Northeast Passage\nPassage 5:\nJohn Cabot\nJohn Cabot (Italian: Giovanni Caboto [d\u0292o\u02c8vanni ka\u02c8b\u0254\u02d0to]; c. 1450 \u2013 c. 1500) was an Italian navigator and explorer. His 1497 voyage to the coast of North America under the commission of Henry VII of England is the earliest known European exploration of coastal North America since the Norse visits to Vinland in the eleventh century.\nTo mark the celebration of the 500th anniversary of Cabot's expedition, both the Canadian and British governments elected Cape Bonavista, Newfoundland as representing Cabot's first landing site. However, alternative locations have also been proposed.\n\nName and origins\nCabot is known today as Giovanni Caboto in Italian, Zuan Caboto in Venetian, Jean Cabot in French, and John Cabot in English. This resulted from a once-ubiquitous European tradition of nativizing names in local documents, something often adhered to by the actual persons themselves. (Many European names have root origins but diverged culturally, e.g. Charles rendered in German becomes Carl or Karl, and Jaques in English becomes Jack.) In Venice Cabot signed his name as \"Zuan Chabotto\", Zuan being a form of John typical to Venice. He continued to use this form in England, at least among Italians. He was referred to by his Italian banker in London as \"Giovanni\", in the only known contemporaneous document to use this version of his first name.Cabot was born in Italy, the son of Giulio Caboto and his wife; he had a brother Piero. Gaeta (in the Province of Latina) and Castiglione Chiavarese (in the Province of Genoa) have both been proposed as birthplaces. The main evidence for Gaeta are records of a Caboto family residing there until the mid-15th century, but ceasing to be traceable after 1443.Pedro de Ayala, the Spanish envoy and Cabot's contemporary in London, described him in a letter to the Spanish Crown in 1498 as \"another Genoese like Columbus\". John Cabot's son, Sebastian, said his father originally came from Genoa. In 1476 Cabot was made a citizen of the Republic of Venice, which required a minimum of fifteen years' residency in the city; thus he must have lived in Venice since at least 1461.\n\nEarly life\nCabot may have been born slightly earlier than 1450, which is the approximate date most commonly given for his birth. In 1471 Cabot was accepted into the religious confraternity of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista. Since this was one of the city's prestigious confraternities, his acceptance suggests that he was already a respected member of the community.\nOnce he gained full Venetian citizenship in 1476, Cabot would have been eligible to engage in maritime trade, including the trade to the eastern Mediterranean that was the source of much of Venice's wealth. He presumably entered this trade shortly thereafter. A 1483 document refers to his selling a slave in Crete whom he had acquired while in the territories of the Sultan of Egypt, which then comprised most of what is now Israel, Syria and Lebanon. This is not sufficient to prove Cabot's later assertion that he had visited Mecca, which he said in 1497 to the Milanese ambassador in London. In this Mediterranean trade, he may have acquired better knowledge of the origins of the Eastern merchandise he would have been dealing in (such as spices and silks) than most Europeans at that time.\n\"Zuan Cabotto\" is mentioned in a variety of Venetian records of the late 1480s. These indicate that by 1484 he was married to Mattea and already had multiple sons. Cabot's sons were Ludovico, Sebastian and Sancto. The Venetian sources contain references to Cabot's being involved in house building in the city. He may have relied on this experience when seeking work later in Spain as a civil engineer.\n\nCabot appears to have gotten into financial trouble in the late 1480s and left Venice as an insolvent debtor by 5 November 1488. He moved to Valencia, Spain, where his creditors attempted to have him arrested by sending a lettera di raccomandazione a giustizia (\"a letter of recommendation to justice\") to the authorities. While in Valencia, \"John Cabot Montecalunya\" (as he is referred to in local documents) proposed plans for improvements to the harbour. These proposals were rejected, however. Early in 1494 he moved on to Seville, where he proposed, was contracted to build and, for five months, worked on the construction of a stone bridge over the Guadalquivir river. This project was abandoned following a decision of the City Council on 24 December 1494. After this Cabot appears to have sought support in Seville and Lisbon for an Atlantic expedition, before moving to London to seek funding and political support. He probably reached England in mid-1495.\n\nSponsorship\nCabot sought financing and royal patronage in England, in contrast to Columbus' expeditions being financed mainly by the Spanish crown. Cabot planned to depart to the west from a northerly latitude in search of a northern passage to Asia.Historians had thought that, on arrival in England, Cabot went to Bristol, a major maritime centre, to seek financial backers. This was the only English city to have had a history of undertaking exploratory expeditions into the Atlantic. Cabot's royal patent, issued by the Crown in 1496, stated that all expeditions should be undertaken from Bristol, so his primary financial supporters were probably based in that city. In any case, it also stipulated that the commerce resulting from any discoveries must be conducted with England alone, with goods only being brought in through Bristol. Although those goods would be free of other duties, the King was to receive one-fifth of the profit. This would have made Bristol into a monopoly port, with sole right to engage in colonial trade. In stating this, Henry VII of England was presumably influenced by Iberian practices: Portugal having made Lisbon into such a monopoly port, while Spain was in the process of doing the same thing with Seville.\nIn the late 20th century, British historian Alwyn Ruddock found documentation that Cabot went first to London, where he received some financial backing from its Italian community. She suggested one patron was Father Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis, an Augustinian friar who was also the deputy to Adriano Castellesi, the papal tax collector. Ruddock also suggested that Carbonariis accompanied Cabot's 1498 expedition. She further suggested that the friar, on good terms with the King, introduced the explorer to King Henry VII. Beyond this, Ruddock stated that Cabot received a loan from an Italian banking house in London. As Ruddock ordered the destruction of all her research notes on her death in 2005, scholars have had to duplicate her research and rediscover documents. The Cabot Project was formed at the University of Bristol in 2009 to research Cabot and the Bristol expeditions. Francesco Guidi Bruscoli, of the University of Florence, found some of Ruddock's documentation, confirming that Cabot received money in March 1496 from the Bardi family banking firm of Florence. The bankers located in London provided fifty nobles (\u00a316 13s. 4d.) to support Cabot's expedition to \"go and find the new land\". This payment from the Florentine merchants would have represented a substantial contribution, although it was not enough to completely finance the expedition.On 5 March 1496 Henry VII gave Cabot and his three sons letters patent with the following charge for exploration:\n\n... free authority, faculty and power to sail to all parts, regions, and coasts of the eastern, western and northern sea, under our banners, flags, and ensigns, with five ships or vessels of whatsoever burden and quality they may be, and with so many and with such mariners and men as they may wish to take with them in the said ships, at their own proper costs and charges, to find, discover and investigate whatsoever islands, countries, regions or provinces of heathens and infidels, in whatsoever part of the world placed, which before this time were unknown to all Christians. Those who received such patents had the right to assign them to third parties for execution. His sons are believed to have still been minors at that time.\n\nExpeditions\nCabot went to Bristol to arrange preparations for his voyage. Bristol was the second-largest seaport in England. From 1480 onward it had supplied several expeditions to look for the mythical Hy-Brasil. According to Celtic legend, this island lay somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. There was a widespread belief among merchants in the port that Bristol men had discovered the island at an earlier date but had then lost track of it. In a private letter to a colleague (Quinn), Ruddock maintained that she had found evidence in Italian archives that Bristol men had discovered North America before 1470. As the island was believed to be a source of brazilwood (from which a valuable red dye could be obtained), merchants had economic incentive to find it.\n\nFirst voyage\nLittle was recorded of Cabot's first voyage. What is known as the \"John Day letter\", written by John Day, alias Hugh Say, a Bristol merchant originally of London, was sent during the winter of 1497\u201398 to an addressee believed to be Christopher Columbus. The letter refers briefly to this voyage but writes mostly about the second, 1497 expedition. Day noted: \"Since your Lordship wants information relating to the first voyage, here is what happened: he went with one ship, his crew confused him, he was short of supplies and ran into bad weather, and he decided to turn back.\" Since Cabot received his royal patent in March 1496, it is believed that he made his first voyage that summer.\n\nSecond voyage\nSources\nInformation about the 1497 voyage comes mostly from four short letters and an entry in a 1565 chronicle of the city of Bristol (then often spelt Bristow).  The chronicle entry for 1496\u201397 says in full:\nThis year, on St. John the Baptist's Day [24 June 1497], the land of America was found by the Merchants of Bristow in a shippe of Bristowe, called the Mathew; the which said ship departed from the port of Bristowe, the second day of May, and came home again the 6th of August next following.\nThe John Day letter of winter 1497\u201398 provides considerable information about Cabot's second voyage. Day is believed to have been familiar with the key figures of the expedition and thus able to report on it. If the lands Cabot had discovered lay west of the meridian laid down in the Treaty of Tordesillas, or if he intended to sail further west, Columbus would probably have believed that these voyages challenged his monopoly rights for westward exploration.In addition to these letters, Alwyn Ruddock claimed to have found another, written on 10 August 1497 by the London-based bankers of Fr. Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis. This letter has yet to be found. From various written comments made by Ruddock, the letter did not appear to contain a detailed account of the voyage. Ruddock said the letter contained \"new evidence supporting the claim that seamen of Bristol had already discovered land across the ocean before John Cabot's arrival in England.\" She contended that Bristol seamen had reached North America two decades before Cabot's expedition.\n\nDetails of the voyage\nThe known sources do not concur on all aspects of the events, and none can be assumed to be entirely reliable. Cabot was described as having one \"little ship\", of 50 tons' burden, called Matthew of Bristol (according to the 1565 chronicle). It was said to be laden with sufficient supplies for \"seven or eight months\". The ship departed in May with a crew of 18 to 20 men. They included an unnamed Burgundian (modern-day Netherlands) and a Genoese barber, who presumably accompanied the expedition as the ship's surgeon (barbers in that era also routinely performed dentistry and minor surgery).\nIt is likely that two ranking Bristol merchants were part of the expedition. One was William Weston, who had not been identified as part of Cabot's expedition before the discovery of a new document in the late 20th century by historian Margaret Condon. In 2009, historian Evan Jones published this document: a letter from Henry VII ordering the suspension of legal proceedings against Weston because it was the King's intent that Weston would shortly undertake a voyage for the King to the \"new founde land\". This was probably the voyage under Cabot's patent, making William Weston the first Englishman to lead an expedition to North America. In 2018, Condon and Jones published a further article that showed that Weston and Cabot had been jointly rewarded by the king in January 1498, suggesting that the explorers were working together before the start of the second voyage. The same article revealed that Weston received a \u00a330 reward after he returned from his successful 1499 voyage.\n\nLeaving Bristol, the expedition sailed past Ireland and across the Atlantic, making landfall somewhere on the coast of North America on 24 June 1497. The exact location of the landfall has long been disputed, with different communities vying for the honor. Historians have proposed Cape Bonavista and St. John's, Newfoundland; Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia; Labrador; and Maine as possibilities. Since the discovery of the John Day letter in the 1950s, it seems most likely that the initial landfall was either on Newfoundland or nearby Cape Breton Island. This is because Day's letter implies that the coastline explored in 1497 lay between the latitudes of Bordeaux, France and Dursey Head in southern Ireland. The initial landfall seems to have taken place close to the southern latitude, with the expedition returning home after reaching the northern one.\n\nLanding\nFor the 500th-anniversary celebrations, the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom designated Cape Bonavista in Newfoundland as the \"official\" landing place. Here in 1997, Queen Elizabeth II along with members of the Italian and Canadian governments greeted the replica Matthew of Bristol, following her celebratory crossing of the Atlantic.Cabot is reported to have landed only once during the expedition and did not advance \"beyond the shooting distance of a crossbow\". Pasqualigo and Day both state that the expedition made no contact with any native people; the crew found the remains of a fire, a human trail, nets, and a wooden tool. The crew appeared to have remained on land just long enough to take on fresh water; they also raised the Venetian and Papal banners, claiming the land for the King of England and recognising the religious authority of the Roman Catholic Church. After this landing, Cabot spent some weeks \"discovering the coast\", with most \"discovered after turning back\".\n\nCelebration\nOn return to Bristol, Cabot rode to London to report to the king. On 10 August 1497, he was given a reward of \u00a310\u2014equivalent to about two years' pay for an ordinary labourer or craftsman. The explorer was f\u00eated; Soncino wrote on 23 August that, similar to Christopher Columbus, Cabot \"is called the Great Admiral, and vast honour is paid to him and he goes dressed in silk, and these English run after him like mad\". Such adulation was short-lived, for over the next few months the king's attention was occupied by the second Cornish uprising of 1497. \nOnce Henry's throne was secure, he gave more thought to Cabot. On 26 September, just a few days after the collapse of the revolt, the king made an award of \u00a32 to Cabot. On 13 December 1497, the explorer was awarded a pension (or salary) of \u00a320 per year. This was to be payable from customs receipts collected in Bristol. The pension was backdated to March 1497, to make clear that Cabot was in the king's service at the time of his expedition. Despite the royal grant, Bristol's customs officers initially refused to pay Cabot his pension, forcing the explorer to obtain an additional warrant from the king.  On 3 February 1498, Cabot was given new letters patent covering the voyage and to help him prepare another expedition. In March and April, the king also advanced a number of loans to Lancelot Thirkill of London, Thomas Bradley, and John Cair, who were to accompany Cabot's new expedition.\n\nFinal voyage\nThe Great Chronicle of London (1189\u20131512) reports that Cabot departed with a fleet of five ships from Bristol at the beginning of May 1498, one of which had been prepared by the king. Some of the ships were said to be carrying merchandise, including cloth, caps, lace points, and other \"trifles\". This suggests that Cabot intended to engage in trade on this expedition. The Spanish envoy in London reported in July that one of the ships had been caught in a storm and been forced to land in Ireland, but that Cabot and the other four ships had continued on.For centuries, no other records were found (or at least published) that relate to this expedition; it was long believed that Cabot and his fleet were lost at sea. But at least one of the men scheduled to accompany the expedition, Lancelot Thirkill, is recorded as living in London in 1501.It is not known whether Cabot died during the voyage, returned safely and died shortly after, or arrived in the Americas and chose to remain there, perhaps remaining with the Indigenous people in a similar manner to \u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9.The historian Alwyn Ruddock worked on Cabot and his era for 35 years. She suggested that Cabot and his expedition successfully returned to England in the spring of 1500. She claimed their return followed an epic two-year exploration of the east coast of North America, south into the Chesapeake Bay area and perhaps as far as the Spanish territories in the Caribbean. Her evidence included the well-known world map of the Spanish cartographer Juan de la Cosa. His chart included the North American coast and seas \"discovered by the English\" between 1497 and 1500.Ruddock suggested that Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis and the other friars who accompanied the 1498 expedition had stayed in Newfoundland and founded a mission. If Carbonariis founded a settlement in North America, it would have been the first Christian settlement on the continent and may have included a church, the only medieval church to have been built there.The Cabot Project at the University of Bristol was organized in 2009 to search for the evidence on which Ruddock's claims rest, as well as to undertake related studies of Cabot and his expeditions. The lead researchers on the project, Evan Jones and Margaret Condon, claim to have found further evidence to support aspects of Ruddock's case, including some of the information she intended to use to argue for a successful return of the 1498 expedition to Bristol. These appear to place John Cabot in London by May 1500, although Jones and Condon have yet to publish their documentation.\nThe project is collaborating on an archaeological excavation at the community of Carbonear, Newfoundland, located at Conception Bay and believed the likely location for Carbonariis's possible mission settlement. The Archaeology of Historic Carbonear Project, carried out by Memorial University of Newfoundland, has conducted summer fieldwork each season since 2011. So far, it has found evidence of planter habitation since the late 17th century and of trade with Spain through Bilbao, including a Spanish coin minted in Peru.\n\nAdditional English voyages\nRuddock claimed that William Weston of Bristol, a supporter of Cabot, undertook an independent expedition to North America in 1499, sailing north from Newfoundland up to the Hudson Strait. If correct, this was probably the first Northwest Passage expedition. In 2009, Jones confirmed that William Weston (who was not previously known to have been involved) led an expedition from Bristol [with royal support] to the \"new found land\" in 1499 or 1500, making him the first Englishman to lead the exploration of North America. This find has changed the understanding of English roles in exploration of that continent. In 2018, Condon and Jones published a further article about William Weston. This revealed that Weston and Cabot had received rewards from King Henry VII in January 1498, following a royal audience, thereby confirming that the two explorers were involved by this stage. Condon and Jones also revealed that in 1500 the King rewarded Weston \u00a330 for \"his expenses about the finding of the new land\".King Henry VII continued to support exploration from Bristol. The king granted Hugh Eliot, Robert Thorne, and his son a bounty of \u00a320 in January 1502 for purchasing the Gabriel, a ship for an expedition voyage that summer. Later in 1502 or early 1503, he paid Eliot a reward of \u00a3100 for a voyage, or voyages, in \"2 ships to the Isle of new finding,\" as Newfoundland was called. This amount was larger than any previously accounted for in royal support of the explorations. Around this time the Bristol-based explorers established a formal company, backed by Letters Patent, called the Company Adventurers to the New Found Land. This conducted further expeditions in 1503 and 1504.In 1508\u201309, Sebastian Cabot undertook a final voyage to North America from Bristol. According to Peter Martyr's 1516 account, this expedition explored a section of the coast from the Hudson Bay to about Chesapeake Bay. Following his return to England in 1509, Sebastian found that his sponsor, Henry VII, had died and that the new king, Henry VIII, had little interest in westward exploration.\n\nFamily\nCabot married Mattea around 1470, and had issue including three sons:\nLudovico Caboto\nSebastiano Caboto\nSanto Caboto\n\nSebastian Cabot's voyages\nSebastian Cabot, one of John's sons, also became an explorer, later making at least one voyage to North America. In 1508 he was searching for the Northwest Passage. Nearly two decades later, he sailed to South America for Spain to repeat Ferdinand Magellan's voyage around the world. He became diverted by searching for silver along the R\u00edo de la Plata (1525\u20131528) in Argentina.\n\nLegacy and honors\nGiovanni Caboto (1762), painting at Ducal Palace, Venice.\nCabot Tower (1897) in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Cabot's voyage.\nCabot Tower, in Bristol, England.

Along with his older brother, Mart\u00edn Alonso Pinz\u00f3n (c. 1441 \u2013 c. 1493), who captained the Pinta, he sailed with Christopher Columbus on the first voyage to the New World, in 1492, as captain of the Ni\u00f1a.\n\nPersonal life\nPinz\u00f3n was born in Palos de la Frontera on the Atlantic coast of Huelva, youngest of the three prominent sons of seaman Mart\u00edn Pinz\u00f3n and his wife Mayor Vicente. His birth year is uncertain; it is generally given as c. 1462; Juan Gil concludes from legal documents that his two daughters were over the age of 20 in 1509, that it certainly cannot be later than 1469. 1469 would be quite a late date, given that there is record of him being a corsair or privateer (with his older brother Mart\u00edn Alonso) in Mediterranean waters between 1477 and 1479 when other towns failed to provide Palos with an adequate supply of grain in wartime.He married twice: first to Teresa Rodr\u00edguez, by whom he had two daughters, Ana Rodr\u00edguez Pinz\u00f3n and Juana Gonz\u00e1lez Pinz\u00f3n; second, probably in 1509, to Ana de Trujillo, who some surviving documents refer to as \"Ana N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Trujillo\".It would appear that he was based in Palos at least up to and including the time of Columbus's first voyage (1492); by 1495 he was living in nearby Moguer; after the economic failure of his 1499\u20131500 expedition, he appears to have moved no later than 1502 to Seville. He may have moved there to escape creditors. Historian Juan Gil, researching Pinz\u00f3n's family life, found strong circumstantial evidence that his first wife left behind a mansion in Triana, across the river from Seville: her own property, not his, which passed into the hands of their daughters.The last primary record of him is in 1514, in Seville or Triana. According to the chronicler Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s, he died that year, probably at the end of September. It is not known precisely where he is buried, though Oviedo expressed confidence that it was in the cemetery of Triana.\n\nCareer\nIn 1499, Pinz\u00f3n sailed to the South American coast. Pinz\u00f3n eventually disembarked on the shore called \"Praia do Para\u00edso\", in present-day Cabo de Santo Agostinho of the state of Pernambuco, or further northwest, in what is today Fortaleza (capital of the Brazilian state of Cear\u00e1). According to the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) between the Crown of Castile and Portugal, Castile (later Spain) could make no claim, but the place was named \"Cabo de Santa Mar\u00eda de la Consolaci\u00f3n\" by Pinz\u00f3n. He also sighted the Amazon River and ascended to a point about fifty miles from the sea. He called it the \"R\u00edo Santa Mar\u00eda de la Mar Dulce\" (\"River of Saint Mary of the Fresh Water Sea\") on account of the vastness of the fresh water river mouth, and he thus became the first European explorer to discover an estuary of the Amazon River. Pinz\u00f3n is also considered the discoverer of the Oiapoque River.In 1505, Pinz\u00f3n was named commander-in-chief and corregidor of the city of Puerto Rico, now called \"San Juan\". This was to be the first step in the colonization of the island called \"Borinqu\u00e9n\" by its inhabitants and \"San Juan Bautista\" by the Spanish (now called \"Puerto Rico\"). However, Pinz\u00f3n did not fulfill this commission. In 1508, he travelled with Juan D\u00edaz de Sol\u00eds to South America. No record exists of Pinz\u00f3n after 1514.\n\nLegacy\nIn 1832, botanists Mart. & Zucc. published Pinzona, a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Dilleniaceae and named in honour of Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n.Together with his brother, Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n is the namesake of Pinz\u00f3n Island in the Gal\u00e1pagos.\nOn November 19, 1999, a statue of Pinz\u00f3n and his brother was dedicated in Palos de la Frontera, Spain, on the occasion of the fifth centennial of the discovery of Brazil and of the brotherhood with the city, Cabo de Santo Agostinho, Brazil.\n\nSee also\nList of explorers\nVicente Ya\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n River, aka Oiapoque\nPassage 7:\nFrederick de Houtman\nFrederick de Houtman (c.\u20091571 \u2013 21 October 1627) was a Dutch explorer, navigator, and colonial governor who sailed on the first Dutch expedition to the East Indies from 1595 until 1597, during which time he made observations of the southern celestial hemisphere and contributed to the creation of 12 new southern constellations.\n\nCareer\nEast Indies\nDe Houtman was born in Gouda. De Houtman assisted fellow Dutch navigator Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser with astronomical observations during the first Dutch expedition to the East Indies from 1595 until 1597. In 1598, de Houtman sailed on a second expedition led by his brother, Cornelis de Houtman, who was killed during the voyage. Frederick was imprisoned by the Sultan of Aceh, Alauddin Riayat Syah, in northern Sumatra.\nHe used his two years of captivity\u2014from September 1599 until August 1601\u2014to study the local Malay language and to make astronomical observations. These observations supplemented those made by Keyser on the first expedition. The constellations formed from their observations were first published in 1597 or 1598 on a globe by Petrus Plancius, and later globes incorporated adjustments based on De Houtman's later observations.Credit for these constellations is generally assigned jointly to Keyser, De Houtman, and Plancius, though some of the underlying stars were known beforehand. The constellations are also widely associated with Johann Bayer, who included them in his celestial atlas, Uranometria, in 1603. After De Houtman's return to Europe, De Houtman published his stellar observations in an appendix to his dictionary and grammar of the Malayan and Malagasy languages.\n\nAustralia\nIn 1619 De Houtman sailed in the Dutch East India Company ship Dordrecht, along with Jacob Dedel in the Amsterdam. They sighted the Australian coast near present-day Perth, which they called Dedelsland. After sailing northwards along the coast he encountered and only narrowly avoided a group of shoals, subsequently called the Houtman Abrolhos.\nDe Houtman then made landfall in the region known as Eendrachtsland, which the explorer Dirk Hartog had encountered earlier. In his journal, De Houtman identified these coasts as Locach, mentioned by Marco Polo to have been a country far south of China and indicated as such on maps by cartographers Plancius and Linschoten.\n\nSee also\nJohn Davis \u2013 English explorer who accompanied De Houtman on the first East Indies' expedition as its pilot\nPassage 8:\nFrancisco de Eliza\nFrancisco de Eliza y Reventa (1759 \u2013 February 19, 1825) was a Spanish naval officer, navigator, and explorer. He is remembered mainly for his work in the Pacific Northwest. He was the commandant of the Spanish post in Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island, and led or dispatched several exploration voyages in the region, including the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Strait of Georgia.\n\nEarly life\nFrancisco de Eliza was born in El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda, Spain, in 1759. He began his career with the Spanish Navy in 1773, graduating from the Real Colegio de Guardiamarinas in Cadiz. In 1775 he served in the Spanish expedition against Algiers. He was sent to America in 1780 and later took part in the siege of Pensacola, Florida, during the American Revolution.\n\nPacific Northwest\nNootka Sound and the Nuu-chah-nulth\nIn 1789 Eliza and several other officers were chosen by Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra to serve at San Blas, the naval station on the west coast of Mexico, then part of New Spain. Bodega y Quadra was the newly appointed commandant of San Blas. The San Blas naval department was responsible for supporting and exploring the coast north of Mexico, including Alta California and the Pacific Northwest to southern Alaska.  The viceroy of New Spain, Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes, Count of Revillagigedo, gave Eliza command of an expedition to reoccupy the Spanish establishment at Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island. The outpost, which the Spanish called Santa Cruz de Nuca, had been established by Esteban Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez in 1789 and then abandoned in October of the same year, after the \"Nootka Incident\", which triggered an international crisis between Spain and Great Britain known as the Nootka Crisis.The King of Spain, Carlos IV, issued the Royal Order of April 14, 1789, requiring the establishment at Nootka Sound be maintained with \"honour and firmness\". Neither the king nor Viceroy Revillagigedo nor Bodega y Quadra was aware of the abandonment of the post at Nootka until December 1789, when Mart\u00ednez arrived at San Blas. Eliza's expedition to relieve Mart\u00ednez at Nootka became one to reoccupy the site and establish a permanent settlement.Eliza sailed to Nootka Sound in command of the ships Concepci\u00f3n, San Carlos (el Filipino), and Princesa Real (formerly the British ship Princess Royal), arriving on April 3, 1790. There were no Europeans present when they arrived. For several years the Spanish pressed their territorial claims to the Pacific Northwest, with Nootka Sound, Francisco Eliza, and other Spanish commanders playing key roles. In addition to the sailing crews of the three ships, Eliza's expedition included 76 soldiers of the Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia, under the command of Pere d'Alberni. This group of people constructed a small fort, and various buildings, planted a garden, and began to organize exploring parties. The outpost was built on a small sheltered cove inside Nootka Sound, called Friendly Cove by the English and Puerto de la Santa Cruz de Nuca by the Spanish (today it is Yuquot, British Columbia). Some Spanish maps show it as Cala de Los Amigos, a translation of the English name. The small fort built by the Spanish was called San Miguel, and was located on a small island at the entrance to the cove.In May 1790 two exploring voyages were dispatched by Eliza. Salvador Fidalgo made a voyage north to visit the Russian outposts in Alaska, while Manuel Quimper examined the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Quimper's pilot was Gonzalo L\u00f3pez de Haro. Some of the important sites found and charted during Quimper's expedition include Neah Bay, Esquimalt Harbour, Admiralty Inlet, Haro Strait, Rosario Strait, and Deception Pass.The relationship between the Spanish and the Nootka natives (Nuu-chah-nulth) was tense. The year before Eliza arrived a Nootka chief, Callicum, had been killed by the Spanish. Several hostile encounters occurred while Eliza's party was building their settlement. On one occasion, five Nootkas were killed. Nonetheless, Eliza was able to improve the relationship somewhat. At least some of the Nootkas grew friendlier and provided assistance to the Spanish.The winter of 1790-1791 was difficult for the Spanish under Eliza. A lack of fresh food resulted in outbreaks of scurvy. During the winter 9 men died and 32 more, too sick to remain, were sent to California to recover.\n\nStraits of Georgia and Juan de Fuca\nFurther exploration voyages were undertaken in 1791. During the winter Spain had proposed to Great Britain that the Strait of Juan de Fuca could serve as the boundary between Spanish and British territory. If accepted, Spain would have to relocate its Nootka Sound post to a site south of the Strait. This, in addition to the need for a better understanding of the Strait's geography led the viceroy of New Spain to order another exploring expedition, this time led by Francisco Eliza himself.In early May, Eliza set out in command of the San Carlos, with Juan Pantoja and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Verd\u00eda as first and second pilots. The San Carlos was accompanied by the small schooner, the Santa Saturnina, nicknamed La Orcasitas and under the command of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Narv\u00e1ez, with Juan Carrasco as pilot.\n\nNarv\u00e1ez explored the inner waters of Clayoquot Sound and Barkley Sound while Eliza, investigating the outer edge of Clayoquot Sound, met and befriended Wickaninnish, chief of the Tla-o-qui-aht people. Narv\u00e1ez and Eliza entered the Strait of Juan de Fuca separately, rejoining at Esquimalt (called \"Cordova\" by the Spanish) on June 11, 1791. Eliza's pilots then took the Santa Saturnina and a longboat and spent ten days exploring Haro Strait and the found it opened up into a wide body of water to the north. This was the Strait of Georgia, which was previously unknown to Europeans. Eliza remained at Esquimalt during this time. After the pilots returned to Eliza and reported their findings, a longer exploration expedition was fitted out. Narv\u00e1ez led the voyage in the Santa Saturnina. Eliza considered taking the San Carlos along, but his pilots convinced him of that the larger ship would find the narrow channels hazardous. In addition, Eliza fell sick. The entire expedition moved its base of operations from Esquimalt to Port Discovery (\"Puerto de Quadra\" to the Spanish). Then on July 1, 1791, Narv\u00e1ez, with Carrasco, sailed north, passing through Rosario Strait, past Bellingham Bay, and into the Strait of Georgia.For three weeks they followed the Strait northward, reaching as far as Texada Island, which they gave the name \"Isla de Texada\". They noted various inlets which, along with the presence of whales led Eliza to think, correctly, that there was another passage to the open ocean. Although the idea of a Northwest Passage to the Atlantic Ocean was by this time an extremely remote possibility, the inlets of the Strait of Georgia rekindled the hope, which led to the 1792 expedition of Dionisio Alcal\u00e1 Galiano and Cayetano Valdes. A rough map of the Strait of Georgia produced from the voyage of Santa Saturnina showed a particularly large opening to the east. Eliza's report stated that if a Northwest Passage existed at all, it must lie beyond this opening. The Spanish named the inlet \"Canal Floridablanca\", the investigation of which was made a priority for the expedition of Galiano and Valdes. It turned out to be the mouth of the Fraser River. The Santa Saturnina had been too far offshore to see the low-lying land.At the start of Narv\u00e1ez's voyage the Santa Saturnina passed Admiralty Inlet, the entrance to Puget Sound (called \"Ensenada de Caama\u00f1o\" by the Spanish). Narv\u00e1ez saw that it was a large channel leading to the south and planned to explore it after returning from the north. But the Strait of Georgia proved larger than expected and Narv\u00e1ez ran out of food, the Santa Saturnina being very small. Narv\u00e1ez had to return directly to Port Discovery, and then Eliza was eager to then return to Nootka Sound and send a report about the Strait of Georgia. The Spanish thus missed the opportunity of preempting the British exploration of Puget Sound, which took place a year later under George Vancouver.While sailing back to Nootka Sound Eliza's expedition entered the deep harbor of present-day Port Angeles and gave it the name \"Puerto de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Los Angeles\". Eliza, with Narv\u00e1ez in the San Carlos, returned to Nootka Sound in August, 1791. The Santa Saturnina, under Carrasco during the return to Nootka, was unable to beat upwind to Nootka and instead sailed to Monterey, California.\nOver time Eliza has received most of the credit for the discoveries made and places named during the 1791 expedition, but he actually did no exploring himself. Most of the credit should go to his pilots Narv\u00e1ez, Carrasco, Pantoja, and Verd\u00eda.The winter of 1791-1792 was easier than the previous one. Shipments of food from Mexico and assistance from the Nootkas helped Eliza's small outpost survive.On July 24, 1792, Francisco de Eliza left Nootka Sound for Mexico, having completed his mission of re-establishing the Spanish outpost there. The position of commandant at Nootka Sound passed to Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra.\n\nLater life\nIn 1793 Eliza commanded an expedition that explored the coast of California. From 1795 to 1801 he was the commander of the naval base at San Blas. In 1803 he was transferred to C\u00e1diz, Spain.\nEliza continued to serve in the Spanish navy. When Spain was occupied by Napoleon from 1808 to 1814, Eliza held a number of political posts at C\u00e1diz.\n\nLegacy\nEliza Island was named in his honor.\nPassage 9:\nGiovanni Battista Caviglia\nGiovanni Battista Caviglia (1770 in Genoa \u2013 September 7, 1845, in Paris) was an Italian explorer, navigator and Egyptologist. He was one of the pioneers of Egyptian archeology of his time. He was influential in the excavation of the Sphinx of Giza near Cairo.\n\nEarly life\nHe was born in Genoa in 1770 at a time when the city was the capital of the Republic of Genoa. He spent most of his life sailing in the Mediterranean in which he became a merchant captain.\n\nCareer in Egypt\nWhen he decided to start his career as an explorer, he left his ship moored in Alexandria and offered his services to various collectors. Most of his excavations were carried out on behalf of the British Consul General Henry Salt.\nBetween 1816 and 1817, he explored the Great Pyramid of Giza where he made important discoveries, including the descending corridor, the bottom of the well service and unfinished underground room.\n\nIn 1817, Salt hired him to excavate the Great Sphinx at Giza, which over the centuries had been almost totally covered by the desert sand.\nThe last dig around the Sphinx had been carried out in 160 AD by order of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. As the excavations continued under Caviglia, he came upon an array of ancient Egyptian artifacts and inscriptions in Greek and Latin.\nIn 1819, he had to suspend his research.\n\nDuring excavations carried out in 1820 on behalf of the British in the ancient capital of Memphis, about 20 km south of Cairo, he made another \"sensational\" discovery: the Colossus of Ramses II. This huge statue of limestone was found near the south gate of the Temple of Ptah, near the village of Mit Rahina. Despite missing its feet, the statue measured over 10 meters tall. The statue was offered, through the Egyptologist Ippolito Rosellini, to Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany who refused the offer due to the difficulties and cost involved in transportation.\nFollowing this, the pasha of Egypt Mehmet Ali gave it to the British Museum in London, which in turn declined the offer for the same reasons. A museum was then built over the statue where you can still find it today.In 1835, when he was already 65 years old, the British Egyptologists Richard William Howard Vyse and John Shae Perring hired him as an assistant for their excavations at Giza. The research was carried out using large quantities of gunpowder and took place in the pyramids of Khufu and Menkaure. The collaboration lasted a couple of years after which Vyse fired him.\n\nLater life and death\nCaviglia spent the last years of his life in Paris, where he died on 7 September 1845.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 10:\nPennell Coast\nPennell Coast is that portion of the coast of Antarctica between Cape Williams and Cape Adare. To the west of Cape Williams lies Oates Coast, and to the east and south of Cape Adare lies Borchgrevink Coast. Named by New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee (NZ-APC) in 1961 after Lieutenant Harry Pennell, Royal Navy, commander of the Terra Nova, the expedition ship of the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910\u201313. Pennell engaged in oceanographic work in the Ross Sea during this period. In February 1911 he sailed along this coast in exploration and an endeavor to land the Northern Party led by Lieutenant Victor Campbell.\nThe name is also used more loosely to refer to both the coast itself and the hinterland extending south to the watershed of the Southern Cross Mountains to the southeast and the Usarp Mountains to the west.\nMajor features of the coast include the 250-kilometer long Rennick Glacier (one of Antarctica's largest glaciers), the Anare Mountains, and the northern ends of the Bowers and Admiralty mountain ranges. Inland, the land is dominated by numerous smaller mountain ranges (notably the Freyberg Mountains and the Concord Mountains), and by two large n\u00e9v\u00e9s, the Rennick N\u00e9v\u00e9 and the Evans N\u00e9v\u00e9\n\nOther Features\nDwyer Escarpment\nJago Nunataks\nPassage 11:\nSebastian Cabot (explorer)\nSebastian Cabot (Italian and Venetian: Sebastiano Caboto, Italian: [seba\u02c8stja\u02d0no ka\u02c8b\u0254\u02d0to]; Spanish: Sebasti\u00e1n Caboto, Gaboto or Cabot; c. 1474 \u2013 c. December 1557) was a Venetian explorer, likely born in the Venetian Republic and a Venetian citizen. He was the son of Venetian explorer John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto) and his Venetian wife Mattea.\nAfter his father's death, Cabot conducted his own voyages of discovery, seeking the Northwest Passage through North America on behalf of England. He later sailed for Spain, traveling to South America, where he explored the Rio de la Plata and established two new forts.\n\nEarly life and education\nAccounts differ as to Sebastian Cabot's place and date of birth.  The historian James Williamson reviewed the evidence for various given dates in the 1480s and concluded that Sebastian was born not later than 1484, the son of John Cabot, a Venetian citizen credited with Genoese or Gaetan origins by birth, and of Mattea Caboto, also Venetian. Late in life, Cabot himself told Englishman Richard Eden that he was born in Bristol, and that he travelled back to Venice with his parents at four years of age, returning again with his father, so that he was thought to be Venetian.  At another time, he told the Venetian ambassador at the court of Charles V, Gasparo Contarini (who noted it in his diary), that he was Venetian, educated in England. In 1515 Sebastian's friend Peter Martyr d'Anghiera wrote that Cabot was a Venetian by birth, but that his father (John Cabot) had taken him to England as a child.  His father had lived in Venice from 1461, as he received citizenship (which required 15 years' residency) in 1476. The Caboto family moved to England in 1495 if not before.\nSebastian, his elder brother Ludovico and his younger brother Santo were included by name with their father in the royal letters patent from King Henry VII of March 1496 authorizing their father's expeditions across the Atlantic. They are believed by some historians, including Rodney Skelton, still to have been minors since they were not mentioned in the 1498 patent their father also received. John Cabot sailed from Bristol on the small ship Matthew and reached the coast of a \"New Found Land\" on 24 June 1497. Historians have differed as to where Cabot landed, but two likely locations often suggested are Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.\n\n1494 Cabot scouting expedition\nAccording to Cartograf\u00eda Mar\u00edtima Hispana, Sebastian Cabot included a handwritten text in Latin on his famous map of North America (published in Antwerp, 1544) claiming to have discovered North America with his father in 1494, three years before his father's voyage. Sancho Gutierrez repeated this text in Castilian on his 1551 map. \nPlaced next to the border of North America, the text reads:\n\nThis land was discovered by Johannes Caboto, venetian and Sebastian Caboto, his son, in the year of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ MCCCCXCIV, 24th of June in the morning. They put to it the name 'prima terra vista' and [...] This big island was named Saint John, as it was discovered on Saint John holiday. People there wander wearing animal furs. They use bow and arrow to fight, javelins and darts and wooden batons and slings. This is a very sterile land, there are a lot of white bears and very big deers, big as horses, and many other animals. As well there are infinite fish: plaices, salmons, very long soles, 1 yard long  and many other varieties of fish. Most of them are called cod. And there are also black hawks, black as ravens, eagles, partridges and many other birds.\nThe year is stated as MCCCCXCIV (1494) in both hand-written versions. There cannot be confusion with the commonly accepted date for the Cabots' voyage, in 1497. Two suppositions can explain this. Sebastian Cabot and Sancho Guti\u00e9rrez may have changed the date in the middle of the sixteenth century. Intentional changes and inaccuracies were very common among geographers at the time, depending on the political interests of their sponsors. As Cabot was funded at the time of the map by Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain, he may have been interested in showing that the first travel to North America was in 1494 and thus funded by Castilians or by Portuguese, and not by English or French. By the time Cabot was sponsored by Germany and Spain, both England and France had started claiming shares of the New World in competition with Spain and Portugal.If Cabot and Guti\u00e9rrez stated the correct year, it would mean the Cabots sailed to North America on their own account, before proposing their services to England in 1496. No contemporaneous documentation for this has survived.\n\nEarly career with England and Spain\nIn 1504 Sebastian Cabot led an expedition from Bristol to the New World, using two ships: Jesus of Bristol and  Gabriel of Bristol. These were mastered by Richard Savery and Philip Ketyner, respectively, and fitted out by Robert Thorne and Hugh Elyot. They brought back a certain amount of salted fish, which suggests the voyage was at least partly commercial and that other expeditions may also have included fishing. Cabot was granted an annuity of \u00a310 on 3 April 1505 by Henry VII for services \"in and aboute the fyndynge of the new founde landes\".\n\nIn 1508\u201309 Cabot led one of the first expeditions to find a North-West passage through North America. He is generally credited with gaining \"the high latitudes,\" where he told of encountering fields of icebergs and reported an open passage of water, but was forced to turn back. Some later descriptions suggest that he may have reached as far as the entrance of Hudson Bay. According to Peter Martyr's 1516 account Sebastian then sailed south along the east coast of North America, passing the rich fisheries off the coast of Newfoundland, going on until he was 'almost in the latitude of Gibraltar' and 'almost the longitude of Cuba'. This would imply that he reached as far as the Chesapeake Bay, near what is now Washington, D.C.. Returning home 'he found the King dead, and his son cared little for such an enterprise'. This suggests Sebastian arrived back in England shortly after the death of Henry VII in April 1509 and the accession of Henry VIII, who did indeed show much less interest in the exploration of the New World than his father.\nBy 1512 Cabot was employed by Henry VIII as a cartographer, supplying the king with a map of Gascony and Guienne.   In the same year he accompanied the Marquess of Dorset's expedition to Spain, where he was made captain by Ferdinand V. Cabot believed that Spain was more interested in major exploration, but his hopes of getting Ferdinand's support were lost with the king's death. In the turmoil afterward, no plans would be made for new expeditions, and Cabot returned to England.\nThe scholar and translator/civil servant Richard Eden, who came to know Cabot towards the end of his life, ascribed to the explorer 'the governance' of a voyage of c.1516 under English flag. This has been accepted and elaborated by a number of English writers, particularly of the turn of the nineteenth century. Rodney Skelton, author of Cabot's entry in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography, connected Eden's text to a known expedition of 1517 which indeed aborted, but is not known to have involved Cabot; while the historian Alwyn Ruddock transferred Eden's story of the opposition to Cabot's plans of Thomas Spert, future master of the king's ship Mary Rose, to the explorer's voyage of 1508\u20139.Cabot's effort's in 1521 to bring together and lead an English discovery voyage to North America are well attested.  He had the support of Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey, and some offers of backing in money and ships from both Bristol and London merchants.  But the Drapers Company expressed their distrust of Sebastian, and offered only limited funds.  The response of other livery companies is unknown.  The project was abandoned, and Cabot returned to Spain.\n\nService to Spain\nBelieving that King Ferdinand II of Aragon was giving more financial support to exploration than the English, Cabot moved to Spain from England in 1512. When King Ferdinand died in 1516 it ended a period of exploration and Cabot returned to England.\nBy 1522, he was once again working for Spain as a member of the Council of the Indies and holding the rank of Pilot-Major, where he supervised naval and navigator training, etc. Cabot secretly offered his services to Venice in communications with the Council of Ten. He promised to undertake to find the Northwest Passage to China for Venice if they would receive him.Cabot was commissioned at the rank of captain general in Spain. On 4 March 1525, he was given command of a fleet that was to determine from astronomical observation the precise demarcation of the Treaty of Tordesillas, which defined the area of Spanish and Portuguese monopolies. He was also to convey settlers to the Molucca Islands in the Pacific, to strengthen Spanish claims in the spice islands. This voyage was officially noted as an expedition for the discovery of Tarshish, Ophir, Eastern Cathay, and Cipango (Japan). This expedition consisted of four ships with 250 men, and set sail from Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda on 3 April 1526.\nBy this time the survivors of Magellan's expedition had completed their circumnavigation of the world, finding it larger than previously known. The voyage had increased pressure on Spain and Portugal to define their territories, as old boundaries seemed superseded by new data. Cabot was directed to cross the Pacific twice and he might have accomplished a second circumnavigation of the world. When Cabot landed with his expedition in Brazil, however, he heard of the rumours of the great wealth of the Incan king and the nearly-successful invasion of Aleixo Garcia. He abandoned his charge and explored the interior of the R\u00edo de la Plata along the northern border of present-day Argentina.\nCabot had already earned the disapproval of his crew by stranding the fleet in the doldrums and running the flagship aground off Santa Catarina Island. His decision regarding the R\u00edo de la Plata led to open resistance from Martin M\u00e9ndez (his lieutenant general), Miguel de Rodas (pilot of the Capitana), and Francisco de Rojas (the captain of one of the other vessels). He dealt with the mutiny by marooning these men and other officers on Santa Catarina Island, where they are believed to have died.\nCabot sailed into the wide R\u00edo de la Plata and spent five months exploring the estuary. He established a fort called San Salvador at the confluence of the Uruguay and the R\u00edo San Salvador. This was the first Spanish settlement in modern-day Uruguay.\nLeaving the two larger ships there, he sailed up the Paran\u00e1 River in the brigantine and a galley constructed at Santa Catarina. His party constructed a small fort called Santo or Esp\u00edritu Santo at the confluence of the Paran\u00e1 and the R\u00edo Carcara\u00f1\u00e1. This was the first Spanish settlement in present-day Argentina; the town of Gaboto was later constructed nearby and named in his honour. Losing 18 men to an ambush, Cabot returned to San Salvador, passing Diego Garc\u00eda's expedition as he went.\nAs a result of this encounter, Cabot sent one ship back to Spain.  The Trinidad sailed on 8 July 1528 with his reports, accusations against the mutineers, and requests for further aid. In the spring of 1529, he returned upriver to Esp\u00edritu Santo, which he discovered had been overwhelmed and burnt by the Indians during his absence. He recovered the cannon and returned to San Salvador.\nAt a council on 6 August 1529, he decided to return to Spain. Cabot sailed with Garc\u00eda to S\u00e3o Vicente. Purchasing 50 slaves there, he traveled along the coast of Brazil before heading across the Atlantic, reaching Seville on 22 July 1530, with one ship and 24 men.\nHe was arraigned on charges from the Crown, by Rojas, and by the families of Rodas and M\u00e9ndez. He was condemned by the Council of the Indies on charges of disobedience, misadministration, and causing the death of officers under his command. He was sentenced to heavy fines and a two-year banishment to Oran in North Africa.During these proceedings, however, the Emperor of Spain had been absent in Germany. Upon his return, Cabot presented him with descriptions of the region. Although no pardon is recorded and the fines were still paid, it is known that Cabot never went into exile.  He retained the post of pilot-major of Spain until 1547. Without losing either title or pension, he left Spain and returned to England.\n\nLater years\nIn the year 1553, Cabot discussed a voyage to China and re-joining the service of Charles V with Jean Scheyfve, the king's ambassador in England. In the meantime Cabot had reopened negotiations with Venice, but he reached no agreement with that republic. After this he acted as an advisor for \"English ventures for discovery of the Northwest Passage. He became governor of the Muscovy Company in 1553 and, along with John Dee, helped it prepare for an expedition led by Sir Hugh Willoughby and Richard Chancellor. He was made life-governor of the \"Company of Merchant Adventurers\", and equipped the 1557 expedition of Steven Borough. By February 1557, he was replaced as governor of the Muscovy Company. He was recorded as receiving a quarterly pension, which he was first paid in person. Someone picked up for him in June and September 1557, and no one was paid in December, suggesting that he had died by then.\n\nMarriages and family\nCabot married Joanna (later recorded as Juana in Spanish documents.) They had children before 1512, the year he entered Spanish service. That year, he returned to London to bring his wife and family to Seville. By 14 September 1514, his wife was dead. Among his children was a daughter Elizabeth. An unnamed daughter was recorded as dying in 1533.In Spain Cabot married again, in 1523, to Catalina de Medrano, widow of the conquistador Pedro Barba. It is not known if the marriage produced offspring. But since the Spanish wills of both Catalina (1547) and Sebastian (1548) name nieces of Catalina as their heirs, it is unlikely that by the time of Catalina's death, the pair had children surviving from their marriage. Catalina died on 2 Sep 1547.\n\nReputation\nFrom the later sixteenth century until the mid-nineteenth century, historians believed that Sebastian Cabot, rather than his father John, led the famous Bristol expeditions of the later 1490s, which resulted in the European discovery, or rediscovery after the Vikings, of North America. This error seems to have been attributed to Sebastian's accounts in his old age. The result was that the influential geographical writer Richard Hakluyt represented his father John Cabot as a figurehead for the expeditions and suggested that Sebastian actually led them. When new archival finds in the nineteenth century demonstrated that this was not the case, Sebastian was denigrated, disparaged by Henry Harrisse, in particular, as a man who willfully appropriated his father's achievements and represented them as his own. Because of this, Sebastian received much less attention in the twentieth century. But other documentary finds, as summarized above, have demonstrated that he did lead some exploratory voyages from Bristol in the first decade of the sixteenth century.A. C. H. Smith wrote a biographical novel about him, Sebastian The Navigator (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1985).\n\nHonors\nA 19th-century bronze relief of Cabot and Henry VII by William Theed is located in the British Houses of Parliament.\n\nNotes\nSources\nKarrow, Robert W.

    "Passage 1:\nRed Dragon (2002 film)\nRed Dragon is a 2002 psychological thriller film based on the 1981 novel by Thomas Harris. It was directed by Brett Ratner and written by Ted Tally. It is the third film of the Dino De Laurentiis Company production, last produced by Universal and last starred by actor Anthony Hopkins. It follows The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Hannibal (2001) as a prequel, being followed by Hannibal Rising (2007). The film sees FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) enlisting the help of serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to catch another killer, Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes). Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, and Philip Seymour Hoffman also star.\nIt is considered the fourth of the five released films regarding Hannibal Lecter. The novel was previously adapted into the film Manhunter (1986). Both films feature the same cinematographer, Dante Spinotti. After turning down the Silence of the Lambs sequel, Hannibal (2001), Silence of the Lambs screenwriter Ted Tally returned to write Red Dragon. It was released on October 4, 2002 to generally positive reviews from critics, who deemed it to be an improvement over Hannibal, but inferior to The Silence of the Lambs.      It was a box office success, earning $209 million worldwide against a $78 million budget. An origin story, titled Hannibal Rising was released in 2007.\n\nPlot\nIn 1980, FBI agent Will Graham visits forensic psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter to discuss a case. Graham has been working with Lecter on a psychological profile of a serial killer who removes edible body parts from his victims; Graham is certain the killer is a cannibal. Realizing Graham is close to discovering he is the killer, Lecter stabs him, but Graham subdues him before falling unconscious. Lecter is imprisoned in an institution for the criminally insane, and Graham, traumatized, retires to Florida with his family.\nYears later, in 1986, another serial killer nicknamed the Tooth Fairy has killed two families \u2013 the Jacobis and the Leeds \u2013 during full moons. With another full moon approaching, special agent Jack Crawford persuades Graham to help develop the killer's profile. After visiting the crime scenes in Atlanta, Georgia, and Birmingham, Alabama, and speaking with Crawford, Graham concludes that he must consult Lecter. Lecter taunts Graham but agrees to help.\n\nThe Tooth Fairy is Francis Dolarhyde, who kills as directed by his alternate personality, which he calls the Great Red Dragon, named after the William Blake painting The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun, which he has tattooed on his back. He believes that each victim brings him closer to becoming the Dragon, as his psychopathology originates from his childhood abuse by his grandmother.\nFreddy Lounds, a tabloid reporter for the National Tattler, pursues Graham for leads on the Tooth Fairy. A letter from the Tooth Fairy is discovered hidden in Lecter's cell, expressing admiration for Lecter and an interest in Graham and suggesting that Lecter reply through the personals section of the Tattler, which he does with Graham's home address, forcing Graham's wife, Molly, and son, Josh, to relocate. While in hiding, Graham teaches Molly how to fire a handgun.\nTo lure out the Tooth Fairy, Graham gives an interview to Lounds, disparaging the killer as an impotent homosexual and that Lecter was only feigning interest in him. Enraged, Dolarhyde kidnaps Lounds, glues him to a wheelchair and reveals himself as the Great Red Dragon. Dolarhyde shows Lounds photos he took of his victims before and after he murdered them. Dolarhyde forces Lounds to recant his allegations on tape, sets him on fire and sends him rolling and crashing into a company sign outside the Tattler offices.\nAt his job in a St. Louis photo lab, Dolarhyde gives blind co-worker Reba McClane a ride to her home and they begin a relationship. However, his alternate personality demands that he kill her. Desperate to stop the Dragon's control over him, Dolarhyde goes to the Brooklyn Museum, tears apart the Blake painting, and eats it.\nGraham realizes that the Tooth Fairy knew the layout of his victims' houses from their home videos. He deduces that he works for the company that edits the home movies and transfers them to video. He visits the company processing plant to ask for information, and is spotted by Dolarhyde as he returns from Brooklyn.\nIn a panic, Dolarhyde goes to Reba's house. She has spent the evening with a co-worker, Ralph Mandy. After Reba enters her home, Dolarhyde kills Ralph, kidnaps Reba, takes her to his house, and sets it ablaze. Unable to shoot her, Dolarhyde apparently shoots himself. Reba escapes as the police arrive.\nAfter an autopsy is performed on the corpse, it is revealed that Dolarhyde used Ralph's body to stage his death. Dolarhyde later infiltrates Graham's home in Florida and takes Josh hostage, threatening to kill him. To save Josh, Graham loudly insults him, reminding Dolarhyde of his grandmother's abuse and provoking him to furiously attack Graham. Both are severely wounded in a shootout, which ends when Molly kills Dolarhyde.\nGraham survives and receives a letter from Lecter praising his work and bidding him well. Lecter's jailer, Dr. Frederick Chilton, tells him that he has a visitor, a young woman from the FBI.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs, starring Anthony Hopkins as Lecter, was a critical and commercial success, winning five Academy Awards. Hopkins was the only major member of the Silence of the Lambs team to return for the 2001 sequel, Hannibal; it was also a commercial success, but received less positive reviews. Both films were adapted from novels by Thomas Harris.Husband-and-wife producers Dino and Martha De Laurentiis decided to produce a film based on the 1981 novel Red Dragon, the first Hannibal Lecter novel, as a prequel to The Silence of the Lambs. Dino said that people thought he was \"crazy\" for adapting the book, as it had been previously adapted as Manhunter (1986), with Brian Cox as Lecter. Both Manhunter and Red Dragon had the same cinematographer, Dante Spinotti.Hopkins hesitated to sign on, worried that three Lecter films might be too much. Screenwriter Ted Tally, who wrote The Silence of the Lambs but not Hannibal, had turned down many offers to write more serial killer stories. He said he liked the idea of Hopkins' Lecter films forming a trilogy: \"If it ends here, it will end gracefully. I would hate to see this become Hannibal Lecter XIII.\" To satisfy expectations, Tally added Lecter scenes not in the novel, describing it as a \"commercial reality\". He had the support of Harris, who sent Tally dialogue and ideas for scenes. Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes admired The Silence of the Lambs but had not enjoyed Hannibal. The cast were persuaded to join by Tally's screenplay; Fiennes felt it worked \"only on suspense\", without overt violence.Norton and Ratner disagreed on the scene in which Graham approaches the incarcerated Lecter for the first time. Ratner wanted Norton to incorporate a gesture or look to indicate Graham's fear, but Norton felt the audience would not need this if it were filmed correctly. They compromised by showing Graham's sweat stains when he removes his jacket in the next scene. Whereas Fiennes wanted to avoid overplaying his serial killer character, Hopkins aimed to play Lecter with more \"danger and rage\" than before. Fiennes spent 90 minutes of each day for months building his physique, and wore a prosthetic to give him a cleft palate. The tattoo on his back took around eight hours to apply.\n\nSoundtrack\nRed Dragon: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was composed by Danny Elfman, and produced by Mark Helfrich and Brett Ratner.

The site's consensus said the film is \"competently made, but everything is a bit too familiar\". On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, stating: \"This darkly seductive, flawlessly acted piece is worlds removed from most horror films. Here monsters have their grandeur, heroes their gravity. And when they collide, a dance of death ensues between two souls doomed to understand each other.\" Todd McCarthy of Variety also gave the film a positive review, saying that the \"audiences will be excused for any feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu the new film might inspire. That won't prevent them from watching it in rapt, anxious silence, however, as the gruesome crimes, twisted psychology and deterministic dread that lie at the heart of Harris' work are laid out with care and skill.\"Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of four, praising Brett Ratner's directing and the film's atmosphere. He stated: \"To my surprise, Ratner does a sure, stylish job, appreciating the droll humor of Lecter's predicament, creating a depraved new villain in the Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes), and using the quiet, intense skills of Norton to create a character whose old fears feed into his new ones. There is also humor, of the uneasy he-can't-get-away-with-this variety, in the character of a nosy scandal-sheet reporter (Philip Seymour Hoffman).\" David Sterritt of the Christian Science Monitor gave the film a positive review, stated that \"the most refreshing aspect of Red Dragon is its reliance on old-fashioned acting instead of computer-aided gizmos. Hopkins overdoes his role at times\u2014his vocal tones are almost campy\u2014but his piercing eyes are as menacing as ever, and Ralph Fiennes is scarily good as his fellow lunatic.\"David Grove of Film Threat, who gave the film four stars out of five, said: \"Is Red Dragon a better film than Manhunter? I don't know. I think it stands on its own, but I wonder how much people who are intimately familiar with Manhunter will be shocked by it, although the ending is altogether different and much more realized, I think\". Rick Kisonak, who also wrote for Film Threat, also gave the film a positive review, but he gave it three stars out of five, saying: \"The only downside to this delectable third course? The regrettable likelihood that Lecter fans will have to make do without dessert.\"Edward Guthmann of San Francisco Chronicle, gave the film a mixed review, saying that \"in Hollywood, where integrity is rapidly consumed and careers defined by market value, there's trash and there's trash with a pedigree.\" Stephanie Zacharek, for Salon, also gave the film a mixed review, stating: \"If you buy the overprocessed headcheese of the serial killer as refined genius, you'll love Red Dragon. Or maybe not. Even Hannibal Lecter devotees may lose patience with this picture's grandiose, self-serious ponderousness\u2014that's Lecterese for, 'It's kind of boring in patches, actually.'\" William Arnold of Seattle Post-Intelligencer, who gave the film a mixed review, said that the film \"basically lives up to the old adage that the final work in a trilogy is invariably the weakest.\" Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice gave the film a negative review; he stated: \"Red Dragon's formula is so risible and rote by now that the natural reaction to scenes of peril, torture, and suffering is flippant laughter.\"\n\nHome media\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on April 1, 2003. It was released in two extras-packed DVD editions, a single-disc package and two-disc \"Director's Edition\".

He played college football for the Missouri Southern Lions.  He was originally signed by the Broncos as an undrafted free agent and played his entire career with the team.  As of 2023's offseason, his 849 career receptions and 11,389 receiving yards ranked him 30th all-time for receptions and 34th for yards.\n\nPersonal life\nAt Arkansas Senior High School in Texarkana, Arkansas, Smith lettered two years in football and basketball, and one year in baseball. As a senior in football, he was All-League, All-Area, and All-State. Outside of football Rod Smith has three kids (Roderick Smith Jr., Devin Smith, and Vanessa Webb). He is a business entrepreneur as he has expressed in many interviews. Some of these have featured his kids speaking about their father's accomplishments on and off the field.\n\nCollege career\nSmith enjoyed a stellar career at Missouri Southern State University, finishing with conference records in career receiving yards (3,043) and touchdowns (34). He also broke the school\u2019s reception record (153), and was named first-team All-America by AP, Kodak, Football Gazette and NCAA Division II sports information directors after his senior year. In his final season, Smith caught 63 passes for 986 yards and 13 touchdowns, and was a finalist for the Harlon Hill Trophy, given annually to the top football player at the Division II level. He was named Missouri Southern\u2019s Outstanding Graduate in 1994 after completing his collegiate studies with three degrees, in economics and finance, general business, as well as marketing and management.\n\nProfessional career\nAfter the 1994 draft, Smith went undrafted and was signed by the Denver Broncos as a free agent. His first NFL catch was a last-minute 43-yard touchdown from John Elway in a 38\u201331 win against the Washington Redskins on September 17, 1995. In fourteen seasons as an NFL player, Smith had eight seasons of at least 1,000 receiving yards. He had two seasons of at least 100 receptions (2000: 100; 2001: 113). In 2000, Smith and teammate Ed McCaffrey became only the second wide receiver duo on the same team to each gain 100 receptions in the same season (with Herman Moore and Brett Perriman). His 113 receptions in 2001 led the league. He was a starting wide receiver of the Broncos' back-to-back Super Bowl championships in 1997 and 1998. In the Broncos' 34\u201319 win in Super Bowl XXXIII, Smith had 5 receptions for 152 yards, tied for 5th most in Super Bowl history, including an 80-yard touchdown reception. He was a finalist for the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award in 2004.\nA hip injury that he suffered in 2006 required a complete hip replacement. On December 28, 2007 it was revealed that Smith needed another hip surgery, possibly ending his career. He was placed on the reserve/retired list on February 15, 2008, and announced his formal retirement from professional football on July 24, 2008 in a press conference at the team's Dove Valley headquarters.\nSmith finished his career as the Broncos all-time leader in receptions (849), receiving yards (11,389), and touchdown receptions (68).  Also an accomplished punt returner, Smith returned 53 punts for 647 yards and a touchdown.  His 12.2 yards per return average ranked him 2nd all time among Broncos players with at least 50 punt returns.  With two Super Bowls, three Pro Bowls, and a controversy-free career noted for professionalism, Smith left the Broncos as one of the most well-loved players of all time. In May 2012 it was announced that he would be inducted into the Broncos Ring of Fame in his first year of eligibility for the honor. The induction ceremony took place on Sunday, Sep 23, at halftime of the Broncos' home game against the Houston Texans at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\n\nAwards and accomplishments\nFirst undrafted player to reach 10,000 receiving yards, and the 24th in history to eclipse that figure.\nHas the most receiving yards (11,389) and touchdown receptions (68) of any undrafted player in NFL history.\nRanks second on the most receptions (849) by any undrafted player in NFL history, behind Wes Welker.\nHolds Broncos franchise records in career receptions, receiving yards and touchdown catches.\nRanks first on Denver's all-time yards from scrimmage list.\nOnly the sixth player in NFL history to have 100 receptions against at least 3 teams (Kansas City Chiefs, San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders).\nAFC Offensive Player of the Week (week 15; 12/17/05 against the Buffalo Bills at Buffalo).\nAssociated Press second-team All-Pro (2000, 2001).\nFootball Digest first-team All-Pro (2000, 2001).\nUSA Today first-team All-Pro (2000).\nCollege and Pro Newsweekly first-team All-Pro (2000).\nPro Football Weekly All-AFC (2000, 2001).\nDivision II Hall of Fame (Inducted in 2008)\nCollege Football Hall of Fame (Inducted in 2009)\nDenver Broncos Ring of Fame (Inducted in 2012)\n\nFranchise records\nAs of 2023's NFL off-season, Rod Smith held at least 11 Broncos franchise records, including:\n\nReceptions: career (849), season (113 in 2001)\nReceiving Yds: career (11,389), playoffs (860)\nReceiving TDs: career (68), playoffs (6)\nTotal TDs: career (71)\nYds from Scrimmage: career (11,737)\nAll Purpose Yds: career (12,488)\nGames with 1+ TD scored: career (66)\nSeasons with 1000+ receiving yards: career (8)\nPassage 3:\nRon Smith (wide receiver)\nRonnie Bernard Smith (born November 20, 1956) is a former professional American football wide receiver who played in the National Football League (NFL) for six seasons with the Los Angeles Rams, the San Diego Chargers, and the Philadelphia Eagles.\nSmith played defensive end at Kathleen High School in Lakeland, Florida. At 6 feet (1.8 m) and 185 pounds (84 kg), he received an offer to play for Cal State Fullerton, and instead enrolled at Fullerton College. He switched to playing wide receiver after his first year, and was a Junior College All-American the following season, when he earned a scholarship to play with San Diego State. As a senior in 1977, Smith caught 49 passes for around 700 yards and 14 touchdowns and was a key to the Aztecs' 10\u20131 season.In the 1978 NFL draft, Smith was selected in the second round by the Los Angeles Rams. He caught just one pass as a rookie in 1978. A seldom-used sophomore in 1979, he caught a 43-yard touchdown from Vince Ferragamo at the end of the first half to give the Rams a 14\u20135 lead in an eventual 21\u201319 win over Dallas in the divisional playoffs. In Super Bowl XIV, Smith caught a 24-yard touchdown on a halfback option pass from Lawrence McCutcheon, but the Rams loss 31\u201319 to Pittsburgh. The San Diego Chargers acquired him from the Rams at the end of the preseason in 1980 for a middle-round draft pick. He caught just four passes for 48 yards during the regular season for San Diego.  However, he came up with another key playoff touchdown when he caught a game-winning 50-yard score from Dan Fouts with 2:08 remaining in a 20\u201314 win over the Buffalo Bills, advancing the Chargers to the AFC Championship Game.After his NFL career, Smith signed with the Oakland Invaders of the United States Football League (USFL) in 1984.  Smith played in six games, starting five, and caught nine passes for 107 yards and one touchdown before being placed on injured reserve on May 30, 1984.\n\nExternal links\n\nCareer statistics and player information from NFL.com \u00b7 Pro Football Reference\nPassage 4:\nClarice Starling\nClarice M. Starling is a fictional character and protagonist of the novels The Silence of the Lambs (1988) and Hannibal (1999) by Thomas Harris.\nIn the 1991 film adaptation of The Silence of the Lambs, she was played by Jodie Foster, while in the 2001 film adaptation of Hannibal, she was played by Julianne Moore. In the CBS television series Clarice, she is played by Rebecca Breeds.\nClarice Starling, as portrayed by Foster, is ranked by the American Film Institute as the greatest heroine in film history. Rolling Stone and Entertainment Weekly ranked Starling as one of the \"50 Greatest Movie Protagonists\" and \"100 Greatest Movie Characters\" respectively. Foster's interpretation of Starling is highly ranked amongst the greatest screen performances of all-time, receiving a multitude of accolades including the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1992.\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs\nIn The Silence of the Lambs, Starling is a student at the FBI Academy. Her mentor, Behavioral Sciences Unit chief Jack Crawford, sends her to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. He is housed in a Baltimore mental institution. Upon arriving at the asylum for her first interview with Lecter, the asylum manager Frederick Chilton makes a crude pass at her, which she rebuffs; this helps her bond with Lecter, who despises Chilton. \"Multiple\" Miggs, the inmate in the cell next to Lecter, throws his semen at her; this offends Lecter, who \"influences\" Miggs to commit suicide as a way of apologizing to her.\nAs time passes, Lecter gives Starling information about Buffalo Bill, a currently active serial killer being hunted by the FBI, but only in exchange for personal information, which Crawford had specifically warned her to keep secret from Lecter.\nStarling tells Lecter that she was raised in a small town in West Virginia by her father, a night marshal. When she was a young child, her father was shot when responding to a robbery; he died a month after the incident. Her mother managed to keep the family together for more than two years after his death, working as a motel maid in the daytime and cooking at a caf\u00e9 at night, but she was ultimately unable to support the entire family. When Starling was 10 years old, she was sent to live with her mother's cousin on a Montana sheep and horse ranch, but she ran away when she witnessed the spring lambs being slaughtered, fleeing with a mare also destined for the slaughterhouse whom she named Hannah. Starling was caught, but her mother's cousin eventually agreed to let her go, and she and Hannah both went to a Lutheran orphanage, where she spent the rest of her childhood.\nAccording to the novel, Starling attended the University of Virginia as a double major in psychology and criminology. During that time, she spent two summers working as a counselor in a mental health center. Starling first met Crawford when he was a guest lecturer at UVA. His criminology seminars were a factor in her decision to join the FBI.\nDuring the investigation, Starling is assigned to coax Lecter into revealing Buffalo Bill's identity. Lecter gives her clues in the form of cryptic, riddling information designed to help Starling figure it out for herself. The two grow to respect each other, so when Lecter escapes during a transfer to a state prison in Tennessee, Starling does not fear that he will kill her, as he \"would consider it rude\".\nStarling deduces from Lecter's hints that Buffalo Bill's first victim had a personal relationship with him, and so goes to the victim's home in Belvedere, Ohio, to interview people who knew her. She unknowingly stumbles onto the killer himself, Jame Gumb, who is living under the alias \"Jack Gordon\". When she sees a Death's-head Moth, the same rare kind that Buffalo Bill stuffs in the throats of each of his victims, flutter through the house, she knows that she has found her man and tries to arrest him. Gumb flees, and Starling follows him into his basement, where his latest victim is alive and screaming for help. Gumb turns off the electricity in the basement, and stalks Starling through the rooms wearing night-vision goggles. As Gumb readies to shoot Starling, Starling hears him cock the hammer of his revolver and opens fire towards the sound, killing him. She is lauded as a hero in the press, and graduates with honors from the FBI Academy, becoming a full-fledged agent.\nWeeks later, Lecter writes Starling a letter from a hotel room somewhere in St. Louis asking her if the lambs have stopped screaming.\nThe final scene of the novel has Starling sleeping peacefully at a friend's vacation house at the Maryland seashore.\n\nHannibal\nAt the beginning of Hannibal, Starling is in her early 30s and still working for the FBI, although her career has been held back by Paul Krendler, a Department of Justice official who resents her because he is a misogynist, because she rejected his sexual advances, and because he believes that she humiliated him. She takes part in a bungled drug raid, in which she returns fire after a drug kingpin fires at her, using an infant as a human shield; her superiors blame her for the resulting mess, and she is removed from active duty, mostly at Krendler's instigation. She receives a supportive letter from Lecter, who is (unknown to her at the time) residing in Florence, Italy under an alias. One of Lecter's surviving victims, a sadistic pedophile named Mason Verger, is searching for Lecter and has offered a huge reward, which corrupt Florentine police inspector Rinaldo Pazzi tries to claim when he deduces Lecter's true identity in Florence.\nStarling finds out that Lecter is in Florence and attempts to warn Pazzi. As Starling predicted, Lecter knows about the plot to capture him and, as a result, he kills Pazzi. Lecter then flees to the United States and immediately starts to follow Starling. Starling, meanwhile, is being harassed at the FBI by various corrupt agents, especially by Krendler, who is secretly assisting Verger in his attempt to capture Lecter. Starling attempts to find Lecter first, not only to capture him but also to save him from Verger. Krendler attempts to frame Starling in a scheme planned by Verger, alleging she sent coded newspaper messages to Lecter; this only results in her being suspended, but she is now powerless to stop Verger's men. Lecter is captured by Verger, who plans to feed him to a pack of specially bred wild boars.\n\nStarling is aware that Lecter is being held by Verger, so she attempts to save him so she can bring him in to the authorities. Following Verger's death at the hands of his sister Margot, Starling uses the distraction to try to rescue Lecter. She is wounded in the ensuing gunfight with Verger's men, but Lecter rescues her and nurses her back to health. He then subjects her to a regimen of psychoactive drugs in the course of therapy sessions to help her heal from her childhood trauma and her pent-up anger at the injustices of the world. He considers whether his long-dead younger sister Mischa may somehow be able to live again through Starling.\nDuring this time, Lecter captures Krendler and performs a craniotomy on him while he is still alive. During an elaborate dinner, Lecter scoops spoonfuls of Krendler's forebrain to saute with lemon and capers. In the novel, he serves Krendler's brain to Starling, who finds it delicious.\nLecter's plan for Mischa to live again within Starling ultimately fails, as she refuses to have her own personality sublimated, and he only briefly entertains the idea of Mischa taking his place. Starling then opens her dress and offers her breasts to Lecter; he accepts her offer and the two become lovers. They disappear together, only to be sighted again three years later entering the Teatro Col\u00f3n Opera House in Buenos Aires by former orderly Barney, who had treated Lecter with respect while he was incarcerated in Baltimore. Fearing for his life, Barney leaves Buenos Aires immediately, never to return.\nThe reader then learns that Lecter and Starling are living together in an \"exquisite\" Beaux Arts mansion, where they employ servants and engage in activities such as learning new languages and dancing together and building their own respective memory palaces, and is told that \"Sex is a splendid structure they add to every day\", that the psychoactive drugs \"have had no part in their lives for a long time\", and that Lecter is \"satisfied\" with the fact that Mischa cannot return.\n\nFilms\nIn the film adaptation of The Silence of the Lambs, Starling's role remains relatively unchanged from the book. However, the film adaptation of Hannibal significantly diverges from the novel's conclusion. In the film, Lecter neither attempts to brainwash Starling nor feeds her Krendler's brain (although he does feed portions of it to Krendler himself); instead, Starling tries to apprehend Lecter, but he overpowers her and she handcuffs both of them to the refrigerator in an attempt to keep him in the house before the imminent arrival of the police. Lecter then cuts off his own hand and escapes, leaving Starling to explain the situation to the police. He is later seen on a plane, apparently fleeing the country again.\nAlthough she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for playing Starling in The Silence of the Lambs, Jodie Foster decided not to reprise her role in Hannibal. Julianne Moore portrayed the character in the sequel, with Anthony Hopkins himself recommending her for the role after his previous experience working with her in the film Surviving Picasso.\n\nTelevision\nLifetime\nIn May 2012, Lifetime announced that they were developing a television series centered on Clarice Starling after her graduation from the FBI academy, titled Clarice, which was to be produced by MGM. The project did not go forward.\n\nNBC\nBryan Fuller, the creator of the TV series Hannibal, stated prior to the show's cancellation his desire to include Clarice Starling as a character in the fifth season, provided that he could get the rights from MGM. He said that he planned for the show's fifth season to cover the events of The Silence of the Lambs, and the sixth to cover the events of Hannibal, with the seventh to be an original storyline resolving Hannibal's ending. Since the series' cancellation, Fuller has stated that should the series continue and should they obtain rights to adapt The Silence of the Lambs, Elliot Page or a person of color would be ideal casting for the role of Clarice Starling.\n\nCBS\n\nCBS developed the Clarice TV series as a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs set in 1993, created by Alex Kurtzman and Jenny Lumet. The series stars Rebecca Breeds as the titular character, along with Lucca De Oliveira, Devyn A. Tyler, Kal Penn, Nick Sandow, Michael Cudlitz, and Marnee Carpenter, and premiered on February 11, 2021, on CBS. It was effectively cancelled in June after one season because of low ratings and the breakdown of talks concerning the series' planned move from CBS to Paramount+.\nPassage 5:\nJohn \"Hannibal\" Smith\nColonel John \"Hannibal\" Smith is a fictional character and one of the four protagonists of the 1980s action-adventure television series The A-Team, played by George Peppard. The producers originally had James Coburn in mind to play the part of Hannibal, but it eventually went to Peppard.The character\u2014which was based loosely on former United States Army Special Forces officer Bo Gritz\u2014appeared on The A-Team from its beginning in 1983 until its end in 1987. The character was played by Liam Neeson in the 2010 film adaptation. His often spoken line \"I love it when a plan comes together\" was included in TV Land's \"The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catch Phrases\" in 2006.\n\nCharacter biography\nThe A-Team is a group of ex-United States Army Special Forces soldiers who, near the end of the Vietnam War, were arrested for a crime they did not commit and managed to escape from the Military Police. As fugitives, the A-Team works as soldiers of fortune, using their military training to fight oppression or injustice. Hannibal, along with B. A. Baracus, Templeton \"Faceman\" Peck, and H. M. \"Howlin' Mad\" Murdock make up the A-Team.\nIn the pilot episode (\"Mexican Slayride: Part 1\"), Hannibal is described by a reporter colleague of Amy Allen as follows: \"The leader [of the A-Team] is a Colonel named John Smith. But everybody calls him Hannibal. The guy has a very unorthodox style.\" Smith takes his name from the famous military commander and strategist, as alluded to by B. A. Baracus in the same episode; various items of tie-in literature for the series commented that just as the original Hannibal had led the elephants over the Alps, this Hannibal had led his men over the wall of Fort Bragg after they were wrongly arrested. He is distinguished by his unflappable demeanor, even when in peril, his constant cigar-smoking, his black leather gloves, and his many disguises. He is a master tactician (although his plans rarely turn out as they are supposed to; when asked if she thought this was going to work, Amy Allen summed it up by saying, \"Hannibal's plans never work right. They just work.\") and seems to have a plan for getting the team out of any situation they get into. His favorite catchphrase is, \"I love it when a plan comes together\"; he is often heard to remark \"Nice\" after part of his plan has succeeded - sometimes with destructive or explosive results.\nHe fought in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars, serving in the 5th Special Forces Group in Vietnam, and is a Medal of Honor recipient.  His rank is inconsistent: throughout the first four seasons, he is referred to as possessing the rank of lieutenant colonel, though in keeping with US Army practice, he is most often referred to simply as \"Colonel\". In the fourth-season episode \"Members Only\" and fifth-season episodes \"Trial by Fire\" and \"Firing Line\", however, he is wearing the eagle insignia of a full colonel. (His medals in these episodes are also different from those on display the last time he wore his Class A uniform in the first-season finale, \"A Nice Place to Visit\".) Thriving on adventure and the adrenaline rush of life-threatening situations (or being \"on the jazz\", as the rest of the team refers to it), he seems to genuinely enjoy every challenge they encounter. He is renowned by both allies and enemies for being cool-headed and extremely clever. There is rarely a situation where he is not able to smile in the face of adversity. He will usually light up a cigar when he needs to do some thinking\u2014often when coming up with a plan, or in the heat of a dangerous or exciting moment. He is also often seen putting on his gloves when he senses the action is about to pick up (such as a fist fight breaking out). When captured by their enemies, he will deliver flippant or sarcastic remarks. He regularly dispenses aphorisms, especially to their foes, upon defeating them. He also has some medical skills which he picked up when in Vietnam.\nHe styles himself a \"master of disguise\", though his skill lies not so much in how convincing his disguise is, but in his ability to assume any role and convince others that his role is genuine. Most episodes begin with the prospective clients coming to meet the A-Team, only to be introduced to one of Hannibal's comic aliases. Hannibal uses his various disguises to screen all the A-Team's potential clients to assure they are not fronts for the military\u2014sometimes playing more than one at a time. Clients often make reference to a \"Mr. Lee\", the owner of a Chinese laundromat who tells them where to meet the team.\nHannibal is also an aspiring actor, playing monsters in low-budget horror movies (being a fugitive, he can only choose roles in which his face cannot be seen). His many roles include \"Gatorella\", \"Killgator\" and his most famous, \"The Aquamaniac\". Naturally, Hannibal secures his roles playing his own agent; somehow always 'eluding' the Producer of his true identity.\n\nRomantic relationships\nDr. Maggie Sullivan (season 1 episode 6 \"Black Day at Bad Rock\") \u2013 In an uncharacteristic moment in the series, it is Hannibal who is capable of seducing the episode's leading female role, rather than Face. The character of Maggie Sullivan returns in season 2, episode 21 \"Deadly Maneuvers\", where Hannibal and the doctor still seem to care for one another.\nAnne Sanders (season 3 episode 4 \"Fire!\") - The A-Team is hired by a female firefighter played by Stepfanie Kramer who is capable of challenging Hannibal. The sexual tension between the two rises throughout the episode. Hannibal seemingly gives in to a short fling with the woman, and they share a kiss at the end of the episode. She is not seen in any subsequent episodes.\n\nRecurring aliases\n\"Mr. Lee\" \u2013 The owner of a Chinese laundromat, who often makes use of clich\u00e9d Chinese proverbs and is of unpredictable mood. Mr. Lee only appears on-screen in the pilot episode \"Mexican Slayride: Part 1\" (although a shot of Hannibal in character as Mr. Lee is used as part of the first season opening credits sequence). However, the alias of Mr. Lee is often referred to throughout the series by clients and by the team itself, though these examples tended to fade out after the first two seasons. Typically \"Mr. Lee\" is the first one to screen potential clients and then refers them to a second location to meet a second liaison on behalf of the team.\n\nAwards and decorations\n\"A Nice Place to Visit\"\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Lieutenant Colonel Smith in \"A Nice Place to Visit\".\n\n\"Members Only\"\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Colonel Smith in \"Members Only\".\n\n\"Trial by Fire\" and \"Firing Line\"\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Colonel Smith in \"Trial by Fire\" and \"Firing Line\".\n\n2010 film\nIn the 2010 movie adaptation, Hannibal is portrayed by Liam Neeson. Identified as \"John H. Smith\" on a toe tag, Hannibal is portrayed as a character who, though still tactically brilliant and capable of making a plan come together, is not quite as unflappable as his television counterpart. In fact, due to the betrayal nature of the storyline (concerning the \"crime they did not commit\"), Hannibal is often shown as angry and intense. The team's conviction by military court visibly affects him, though his penchant for wisecracks is still prevalent (for the television character, more than a decade had passed since the conviction so such reactions were never shown in the show).\nExcept at an airport when the A-Team is flying from Norway to Los Angeles (in which Hannibal's disguise is Neeson's real-life appearance), the character does not don any disguises in the film, instead leaving that arm of business to Face. The cigar smoking was also kept intact; despite Neeson being an ex-smoker, he kept his personal preferences aside for the role. Hannibal shows considerable leadership abilities, attempting to take the A-Team's full blame for their alleged crime, and breaking them out of prison when they reject it; however, he steps back and lets Face plan the final mission, a decision B. A. regrets.\nIn the film, Hannibal is a full colonel, has served in both the Army's 75th Ranger Regiment and the 7th Special Forces Group, in which he and his team are still members until their court martial, and has served a total of two and a half years in overseas combat zones.

Two branch campuses are in the Kansas City metropolitan area on the Kansas side: the university's medical school and hospital in Kansas City, Kansas, the Edwards Campus in Overland Park. There are also educational and research sites in Garden City, Hays, Leavenworth, Parsons, and Topeka, an agricultural education center in rural north Douglas County, and branches of the medical school in Salina and Wichita. The university is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\".Founded March 21, 1865, the university was opened in 1866 under a charter granted by the Kansas State Legislature in 1864 and legislation passed in 1863 under the state constitution, which was adopted two years after the 1861 admission of the former Kansas Territory as the 34th state into the Union.Enrollment at the Lawrence and Edwards campuses was 23,958 students in fall 2021; an additional 3,727 students were enrolled at the KU Medical Center (KUMC) for an enrollment of 27,685  students across the three campuses. The university overall (including KUMC) employed 4,776 faculty members (faculty, faculty administrators, graduate student employees and librarians) in fall 2021.Kansas's athletic teams compete in NCAA Division I sports as the Jayhawks, as members of the Big 12 Conference. They field 16 varsity sports, as well as club-level sports for ice hockey, rugby, and men's volleyball.\n\nHistory\nOn February 20, 1863, Kansas Governor Thomas Carney signed into law a bill creating the state university in Lawrence. The law was conditioned upon a gift from Lawrence of a $15,000 endowment fund and a site for the university, in or near the town, of not less than forty acres (16 hectares) of land. If Lawrence failed to meet these conditions, Emporia instead of Lawrence would get the university.\nThe site selected for the university was a hill known as Hogback Ridge (later known as Mount Oread), which was privately donated by Charles L. Robinson, the Republican governor of the state of Kansas from 1861 to 1863, and one of the original settlers of Lawrence, Kansas. Robinson and his wife Sara bestowed the 40-acre (16 ha) site to the State of Kansas in exchange for land elsewhere. The philanthropist Amos Adams Lawrence donated $10,000 of the necessary endowment fund, and the citizens of Lawrence raised the remaining money themselves via private donations. On November 2, 1863, Governor Carney announced Lawrence had met the conditions to get into the state university, and the following year the university was officially organized.\nThe school's Board of Regents held its first meeting in March 1865, which is the event that KU dates its founding from. Work on the first college building began later that year. The school opened for classes on September 12, 1866, and the first class graduated in 1873. According to William L. Burdick, the first degree awarded by the university was a Doctor of Divinity, bestowed upon noted abolitionist preacher Richard Cordley.During World War II, Kansas was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission.\n\nLandmarks and structures\nKU is home to the Robert J.

His nine-year-old son, Thomas, was injured in an automobile accident in Los Angeles and is in critical condition. Just days before Christmas, Pryor hits a prison guard, escapes and heads for the Louisiana swamps. Avoiding the tracking teams assisted by dogs, Pryor makes it to the highway where he hitches a farm truck ride to the nearest town. In town he breaks into a sporting goods store where he takes two firearms and ammo, a knife and hunting clothing leaving an IOU note in lieu of payment. Over the radio he gets the latest news and learns that someone has killed the prison guard who tried to prevent his escape from prison. It's obvious that someone is trying to pin the prison murder on him and frame him. Meanwhile, Louisiana's governor assigns Pryor's escape case to Inspector Markley, a tracking specialist. Inspector Markley decides to start the pursuit in Texas, on a hunch that Pryor might be heading that way in order to reach California. Things get even more complicated when Pryor starts carjacking people and taking hostages in his obsessive aim to reach his injured son in Los Angeles before Christmas.\n\nCast\nProduction\nIn November 1977 Peppard announced he wanted to direct and star in The Long Escape. \"Directing is something I've wanted to do a long time,\" he said.Peppard later said he decided to direct because \"I couldn't hire anyone else as cheaply\" and says the experience \"somehow cleared my head of all the negative feelings I had towards acting.\"Peppard made the film with much of his own money. He later stated that it cost $1 million to produce. \"I'm quite proud of it,\" he said in 1979. \"I sold many assets to help make it but I don't mind. It was the best time of my life. Maybe it would have been a better film with a better script - I don't know - but I just didn't have any money to spare.\" He later said he disliked acting and directing at the same time.Peppard said he wrote most of the script but did not take credit. \"That would be too much of an ego trip.\"His then wife Sherry Boucher played a small role and Bocher's sister Savannah was cast as Peppard's love interest.\nIn December 1977 the film was sold to Universal, by which time Peppard and Boucher were separated. This was attributed to the stress of making the movie.Peppard said he sold the film for $1,250,000, thus allowing him to repay his investors within nine months of the sale.\n\nRelease\nThe film received a regional release on April 21, 1978, opening in eight cities in Arizona, Louisiana and Mississippi before expanding into Southern and Central states before opening in Los Angeles on March 9, 1979.\n\nCritical reception\nThe Los Angeles Times said the film was \"calculated to warm the cockles of every heart in sight... pleasantly insignificant\".\n\nLegacy\nBill Conti's love theme Come With Me Now was the inspiration to the theme tune to Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, hosted by the late Robin Leach.

The events described are often violent and sometimes quite horrific in their cruelty both on the journey and in the fighting which took place on Italian soil as Hannibal's army sweeps through the Italian countryside seeking to out-manoeuvre his Roman opponents.\n\nReviews\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/29/books/torture-carnage-elephants.html\nFiction Book Review: Hannibal by Ross Leckie, Author Regnery Publishing $19.95 (0p) ISBN 978-0-89526-443-5\nHannibal (The Carthage Trilogy, #1) by Ross Leckie | Goodreads",
    "Passage 1:\nEverton F.C.\nEverton Football Club () is an English professional association football club based in Liverpool that competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The club was a founder member of the Football League in 1888, and has, as of May 2023, competed in the top division for a record 120 seasons, having missed only four top-flight seasons (1930\u201331, 1951\u201352, 1952\u201353, and 1953\u201354). Everton is the club with the second-longest continuous presence in English top-flight football, and ranks third in the all-time points rankings. The club has won nine league titles, five FA Cups, one European Cup Winners' Cup and nine Charity Shields.\nFormed in 1878, Everton won their first League Championship during the 1890\u201391 season. After winning four more League championships and two FA Cups, the club experienced a post-Second World War lull until a revival in the 1960s. A period of sustained success came in the mid-1980s, when Everton won a further two League championships, one FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup.\nThe club's supporters are colloquially known as \"Evertonians\" or \"Blues\". Everton's main rivals are Liverpool, whose home stadium at Anfield is just under one mile away from Everton's home at Goodison Park; the two clubs contest the Merseyside derby. Everton have been based at Goodison Park since 1892, having moved from their original home at Anfield following a disagreement over its rent. The club's home colours are royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks.\n\nHistory\nEverton was founded as St. Domingo's FC in 1878 so that members of the congregation of St Domingo Methodist New Connexion Chapel in Breckfield Road North, Everton, could play sport year round \u2013 cricket was played in summer. The club's first game was a 1\u20130 victory over Everton Church Club. The club was renamed Everton in November 1879 after the local area, as people outside the congregation wished to participate.The club was a founding member of the Football League in 1888\u201389 and won its first League Championship title in the 1890\u201391 season. Everton won the FA Cup for the first time in 1906 and the League Championship again in 1914\u201315. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 interrupted the football programme while Everton were reigning champions, which was something that would again occur in 1939.\nIt was not until 1927 that Everton's first sustained period of success began. In 1925 the club signed Dixie Dean from Tranmere Rovers. In 1927\u201328, Dean set the record for top-flight league goals in a single season with 60 goals in 39 league games, which is a record that still stands. He helped Everton win its third League Championship that season. However, Everton was relegated to the Second Division two years later during internal turmoil at the club. The club quickly rebounded and was promoted at the first attempt, while scoring a record number of goals in the Second Division. On return to the top flight in 1931\u201332, Everton wasted no time in reaffirming its status and won a fourth League Championship at the first opportunity. Everton also won its second FA Cup in 1933 with a 3\u20130 win against Manchester City in the final. The era ended in 1938\u201339 with a fifth League Championship.The outbreak of the Second World War again saw the suspension of league football, and when official competition resumed in 1946, the Everton team had been split up and paled in comparison to the pre-war team. Everton was relegated for the second time in 1950\u201351 and did not earn promotion until 1953\u201354, when it finished as the runner-up in its third season in the Second Division. The club has been a top-flight presence ever since.\nEverton's second successful era started when Harry Catterick was made manager in 1961. In 1962\u201363, his second season in charge, Everton won the League Championship. In 1966 the club won the FA Cup with a 3\u20132 win over Sheffield Wednesday. Everton again reached the final in 1968, but this time was unable to overcome West Bromwich Albion at Wembley. Two seasons later in 1969\u201370, Everton won the League Championship, finishing nine points clear of nearest rivals Leeds United. During this period, Everton was the first English club to achieve five consecutive years in European competitions \u2013 covering the seasons from 1961\u201362 to 1966\u201367.However, the success did not last; the team finished fourteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth and seventh in the following seasons. Harry Catterick retired, but his successors failed to win any silverware for the remainder of the 1970s despite finishing fourth in 1974\u201375 under manager Billy Bingham, third in 1977\u201378 and fourth the following season under manager Gordon Lee. Lee was sacked in 1981.Howard Kendall took over as manager and guided Everton to its most successful era. Domestically, Everton won the FA Cup in 1984 and two League Championships in 1984\u201385 and 1986\u201387. In Europe, the club won its first, and so far only, European trophy by securing the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1985. The European success came after first beating University College Dublin, Inter Bratislava and Fortuna Sittard. Then, Everton defeated German giants Bayern Munich 3\u20131 in the semi-finals, despite trailing at half time (in a match voted the greatest in Goodison Park history), and recorded the same scoreline over Austrian club Rapid Vienna in the final. Having won both the League and Cup Winners' Cup in 1985, Everton came very close to winning a treble, but lost to Manchester United in the FA Cup final. The following season, 1985\u201386, Everton was the runner-up to Liverpool in both the League and the FA Cup, but did recapture the League Championship in 1986\u201387.\nAfter the Heysel Stadium disaster and the subsequent ban of all English clubs from continental football, Everton lost the chance to compete for more European trophies. A large proportion of the title-winning side was broken up following the ban. Kendall himself moved to Athletic Bilbao after the 1987 title triumph and was succeeded by assistant Colin Harvey. Harvey took Everton to the 1989 FA Cup final, but lost 3\u20132 after extra time to Liverpool.\n\nEverton was a founding member of the Premier League in 1992, but struggled to find the right manager. Howard Kendall had returned in 1990, but could not repeat his previous success. His successor, Mike Walker, was statistically the least successful Everton manager to date. When former Everton player Joe Royle took over in 1994, the club's form started to improve; his first game in charge was a 2\u20130 victory over derby rivals Liverpool. Royle dragged Everton clear of relegation and led the club to the FA Cup for the fifth time in its history by defeating Manchester United 1\u20130 in the final. The cup triumph was also Everton's passport to the Cup Winners' Cup, its first European campaign in the post-Heysel era. Progress under Royle continued in 1995\u201396 as the team climbed to sixth place in the Premiership. A fifteenth-place finish the following season saw Royle resign towards the end of the campaign, and he was temporarily replaced by club captain Dave Watson.\nHoward Kendall was appointed Everton manager for the third time in 1997, but the appointment proved unsuccessful as Everton finished seventeenth in the Premiership. The club only avoided relegation due to its superior goal difference over Bolton Wanderers. Former Rangers manager Walter Smith then took over from Kendall in the summer of 1998, but only managed three successive finishes in the bottom half of the table. The Everton board finally ran out of patience with Smith, and he was sacked in March 2002 after an FA Cup exit at Middlesbrough and with Everton in real danger of relegation. His replacement, David Moyes, guided Everton to a safe finish in fifteenth place.In 2002\u201303 Everton finished seventh, which was its highest finish since 1996. It was under Moyes' management that Wayne Rooney broke into the first team before being sold to Manchester United for a club record fee of \u00a328 million in the summer of 2004. A fourth-place finish in 2004\u201305 ensured that Everton qualified for the UEFA Champions League qualifying round. The team failed to make it through to the Champions League group stage and was then eliminated from the UEFA Cup. Everton qualified for the 2007\u201308 and 2008\u201309 UEFA Cup competitions, and was the runner-up in the 2009 FA Cup final. During this period, Moyes broke the club record for highest transfer fee paid on four occasions: signing James Beattie for \u00a36 million in January 2005, Andy Johnson for \u00a38.6 million in summer 2006, Yakubu for \u00a311.25 million in summer 2007, and Marouane Fellaini for \u00a315 million in September 2008.At the end of the 2012\u201313 season, Moyes left his position at Everton to take over at Manchester United, bringing in staff from Everton to join him in July (assistant manager Steve Round, goalkeeping coach Chris Woods and coach Jimmy Lumsden), with Everton players Phil Neville and Marouane Fellaini also leaving for United, the former joining the coaching staff. Moyes was replaced by Roberto Mart\u00ednez, who led Everton to 5th place in the Premier League in his first season while amassing the club's best points tally in 27 years with 72. The following season, Mart\u00ednez led Everton to the last 16 of the 2014-15 UEFA Europa League, where it was defeated by Dynamo Kyiv, whilst domestically finishing 11th in the Premier League. Everton reached the semi-finals of both the League Cup and the FA Cup in 2015\u201316, but was defeated in both. After a poor run of form in the Premier League, Mart\u00ednez was sacked following the penultimate game of the season, with Everton lying in 12th place.Mart\u00ednez was replaced in the summer of 2016 by Ronald Koeman, who left Southampton to sign a three-year contract with Everton. In his first season at the club, he qualified for the Europa League, but a poor start to the 2017\u201318 season left Everton in the relegation zone after nine games, and Koeman was sacked on 23 October following a 5\u20132 home defeat to Arsenal. Sam Allardyce was appointed Everton manager in November 2017, but he resigned at the end of the season amid fan discontent at his style of play.Marco Silva was named Everton manager in May 2018. In November that year, the club was banned from signing academy football players from its youth clubs for two years. Silva led Everton to finish 8th in his first season in charge, but after a poor start to the following season which left the team in the relegation zone on 14 points, he was sacked on 5 December 2019. His last league match was a 5\u20132 loss to Liverpool at Anfield. Former player and first-team coach Duncan Ferguson stepped in as caretaker manager for the next three games before his replacement, Carlo Ancelotti; Ferguson stayed as assistant manager.Ancelotti left the club in June 2021 to rejoin former club Real Madrid as manager, having led the club to a 10th place finish in his only full season at the club. Former Liverpool manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez was appointed as his replacement, subsequently becoming only the second person to manage both Liverpool and Everton. He was dismissed in January 2022 following 9 losses in his last 13 games in charge at the club, and was replaced by former Chelsea boss Frank Lampard. Lampard was later also dismissed in January 2023 after extremely poor performance. Everton narrowly escaped relegation with a 1\u20130 win over Bournemouth in their last game of the 2022\u201323 Premier League.\n\nColours\nEverton's traditional home colours are royal blue shirts, white shorts and white socks. However, during the first decades of its history, Everton had several different kit colours. The team originally played in white and then blue and white stripes, but as new players arriving at the club wore its old team's shirts during matches, confusion soon ensued. It was decided that the shirts would be dyed black, both to save on expenses and to instill a more professional look. However, the kit appeared morbid, so a scarlet sash was added. When the club moved to Goodison Park in 1892, the colours were salmon pink and dark blue striped shirts with dark blue shorts. The club later switched to ruby shirts with blue trim and dark blue shorts. Royal blue jerseys with white shorts were first used in the 1901\u201302 season. The club played in sky blue in 1906; however, the fans protested, and the colour reverted to royal blue. Occasionally, Everton have played in lighter shades than royal blue (such as in 1930\u201331 and 1997\u201398). The home kit today is royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks. The club may also wear all blue to avoid any colour clashes.\nEverton's traditional away colours were white shirts with black shorts, but from 1968 amber shirts and royal blue shorts became common. Various editions appeared throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Black, white, grey, and yellow away shirts have also been used.\n\nCrest\nAt the end of the 1937\u201338 season, Everton secretary Theo Kelly, who later became the club's first manager, wanted to design a club necktie. It was agreed that the colour be blue, and Kelly was given the task of designing a crest to be featured on the necktie. He worked on it for four months until deciding on a reproduction of Everton Lock-Up, which stands in the heart of the Everton district. The Lock-Up has been linked with the Everton area since its construction in 1787. It was originally used as a bridewell to incarcerate mainly drunks and minor criminals and it still stands on Everton Brow. The Lock-Up was accompanied by two laurel wreaths on either side and, according to the College of Arms in London, Kelly chose to include the laurels as they were the sign of winners. The crest was accompanied by the club motto, \"Nil satis nisi optimum\", meaning \"Nothing but the best is good enough\". The ties were first worn by Kelly and the Everton chairman, Mr. E. Green, on the first day of the 1938\u201339 season.The club rarely incorporated a badge of any description on its shirts. An interwoven \"EFC\" design was adopted between 1922 and 1930 before the club reverted to plain royal blue shirts until 1972 when bold \"EFC\" lettering was added. The crest designed by Kelly was first used on the team's shirts in 1978 and has remained there ever since, while undergoing gradual change to become the version used today.\nIn May 2013, the club launched a new crest to improve the reproducibility of the design in print and broadcast media, particularly on a small scale. Critics suggested that it was external pressure from sports manufacturer Nike, Inc. that evoked the redesign as the number of colours had been reduced and the radial effect was removed, which made the kit more cost efficient to reproduce. The redesign was poorly received by supporters, with a poll on an Everton fan site registering a 91% negative response to the crest. A protest petition reached over 22,000 signatures before the club offered an apology and announced a new crest would be created for the 2014\u201315 season with an emphasis on fan consultation. Shortly afterwards, the Head of Marketing left the club. The latest crest was revealed by the club on 3 October 2013. After a consultation process with the supporters, three new crests were shortlisted. In the final vote, the new crest was chosen by almost 80% of the supporters that took part and began being used in July 2014.\n\nNickname\nEverton's most widely recognised nickname is \"The Toffees\" or \"The Toffeemen\", which came about after Everton had moved to Goodison. There are several explanations for how this name came to be adopted with the best known being that there was a business in Everton village, between Everton Brow and Brow Side, named Mother Noblett's, which was a toffee shop that sold sweets including the Everton Mint. It was also located opposite the lock-up on which Everton's club crest is based. The Toffee Lady tradition, in which a girl walks around the perimeter of the pitch before the start of a game tossing free Everton Mints into the crowd, symbolises the connection. Another possible reason is that there was a house named Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House in nearby Village Street, Everton, run by Ma Bushell. The toffee house was located near the Queen's Head hotel in which early club meetings took place.Everton has had many other nicknames over the years. When the black kit was worn, the team was nicknamed \"The Black Watch\" after the famous army regiment. Since going blue in 1901, the team has been given the simple nickname \"The Blues\". Everton's attractive style of play led to Steve Bloomer calling the team \"scientific\" in 1928, which is thought to have inspired the nickname \"The School of Science\". The battling 1995 FA Cup winning side was known collectively as \"The Dogs of War\". In 2002, when David Moyes arrived as manager, he proclaimed Everton \"The People's Club\", which has been adopted as a semi-official club nickname.\n\nStadium\nEverton originally played in the southeast corner of Stanley Park. The first official match took place in 1879. In 1882, a man named J. Cruitt donated land at Priory Road which became the club's home. In 1884 Everton became tenants at Anfield, which was owned by John Orrell, a land owner who was a friend of Everton F.C. member John Houlding. Orrell lent Anfield to the club in exchange for a small rent. Houlding purchased the land from Orrell in 1885 and effectively became Everton's landlord by charging the club rent, which increased from \u00a3100 to \u00a3240 a year by 1888 \u2013 and was still rising until Everton left the ground in 1892. The club regarded the increase in rent as unacceptable. A further dispute between Houlding and the club's committee led to Houlding attempting to gain full control of the club by registering the company, \"Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd\". Everton left Anfield for a new ground, Goodison Park, where the club has played ever since. Houlding attempted to take over Everton's name, colours, fixtures and league position, but was denied by The Football Association. Instead, Houlding formed a new club, Liverpool F.C.Goodison Park, the first major football stadium to be built in England, was opened in 1892. Goodison Park has staged more top-flight football games than any other ground in the United Kingdom and was the only English club ground to host a semi-final at the 1966 FIFA World Cup. It was also the first English ground to have under-soil heating and the first to have two tiers on all sides. The church grounds of St Luke the Evangelist are adjacent to the corner of the Main Stand and the Howard Kendall Gwladys Street End.On match days, in a tradition going back to 1962, players walk out to the tune \"Johnny Todd\", played in the arrangement used when it was the theme song for Z-Cars. It is a traditional Liverpool children's song collected in 1890 by Frank Kidson and tells the story of a sailor betrayed by his lover while away at sea. On two occasions in 1994, the club walked out to different songs. In August 1994, the club played 2 Unlimited's song \"Get Ready For This\". A month later, the club used a reworking of the Creedence Clearwater Revival classic \"Bad Moon Rising\". Both songs were met with complete disapproval by Everton fans.\n\nTraining facilities\nFrom 1966 to 2007, Everton trained at Bellefield in the West Derby area of Liverpool. The club moved to the Finch Farm training complex in Halewood in 2007. The training ground houses both the Everton first team and the youth academy.\n\nEverton Stadium\nThere have been indications since 1996 that Everton will move to a new stadium. The original plan was for a new 60,000-seat stadium, but in 2000 a proposal was submitted to build a 55,000-seat stadium as part of the King's Dock regeneration. This proposal was unsuccessful as Everton failed to generate the \u00a330 million needed for a half stake in the stadium project, and the city council rejected the proposal in 2003. Late in 2004, driven by the Liverpool Council and the Northwest Development Corporation, the club entered talks with Liverpool F.C. about sharing a proposed stadium on Stanley Park. However, negotiations broke down as Everton failed to raise 50% of the costs. On 11 January 2005, Liverpool announced that ground-sharing was not a possibility and proceeded to plan its own Stanley Park Stadium.Following a unanimous approval by Liverpool City Council to grant planning permission in July 2021, work by contractors, Laing O'Rourke, began on the new stadium on 10 August 2021. The first phase involved infilling the dock with 500,000 cubic metres of sea-dredged sand, and so 2,500 vertical concrete piles have been inserted. Its capacity will be 52,888. It is due to open for the start of the 2024\u201325 season, replacing Goodison Park at an estimated cost of \u00a3760 million.\n\nSupporters and rivalries\nEverton has a large fanbase, with the eighth-highest average attendance in the Premier League in the 2008\u201309 season. The majority of Everton's matchday support comes from the North West of England, primarily Merseyside, Cheshire, West Lancashire and parts of Western Greater Manchester along with many fans who travel from North Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. Within the city of Liverpool, support for Everton and city rivals Liverpool is not determined by geographical basis with supporters mixed across the city. Everton also has many supporters' clubs worldwide in places such as North America, Singapore, Indonesia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Thailand, India, and Australia. Paul McCartney is an Everton supporter. The official supporters club is FOREVERTON, and there are also several fanzines including When Skies are Grey and Speke from the Harbour, which are sold around Goodison Park on match days.\n\nEverton regularly take large numbers away from home both domestically and in European fixtures. The club implements a loyalty points scheme offering the first opportunity to purchase away tickets to season ticket holders who have attended the most away matches. Everton often sell out the full allocation in away grounds, and tickets sell particularly well for North West England away matches. In October 2009, Everton took 7,000 travelling fans to Benfica, which was its largest ever away crowd in Europe since the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup Final.\nEverton's biggest rivalry is with neighbours Liverpool, against whom the club contests the Merseyside derby. The rivalry stems from an internal dispute between Everton officials and the owners of Anfield, which was then Everton's home ground. The dispute resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park and the subsequent formation of Liverpool F.C. in 1892. Following these events, a fierce rivalry has existed between Everton and Liverpool, albeit one that is generally perceived as more respectful than many other derbies in English football. This was illustrated by a chain of red and blue scarves that were linked between the gates of both grounds across Stanley Park as a tribute to the Liverpool fans killed in the Hillsborough disaster. The derby is usually a sellout fixture and has been known as the \"friendly derby\" because both sets of fans can often be seen side by side dressed in red and blue inside both Anfield and Goodison Park. Recently, on the field, matches have tended to be extremely stormy affairs; the derby has had more red cards than any other fixture in Premier League history.\n\nCoaching staff\nAs of 30 January 2023First team\n\nUnder-21s and Under-18s\n\nPlayers\nAs of 7 July 2023\n\nFirst-team squad\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

The club's most recent accounts, from May 2014, show a net total debt of \u00a328.1 million, with a turnover of \u00a3120.5 million and a profit of \u00a328.2 million. The club's overdraft with Barclays Bank is secured against the Premier League's \"Basic Award Fund\", which is a guaranteed sum given to clubs for competing in the Premier League. Everton agreed to a long-term loan of \u00a330 million with Bear Stearns and Prudential plc in 2002 for a duration of 25 years. The loan was a consolidation of debts at the time as well as a source of capital for new player acquisitions. Goodison Park is secured as collateral. On 27 February 2016, it was announced that Farhad Moshiri would buy a 49.9% stake in the club.\nFigures taken from 2013 to 2014 accounts.\n\nShirt sponsors and manufacturers\nSince the 2020\u201321 season, the club's primary shirt sponsor has been Cazoo, after the club announced the early termination of the previous deal with SportPesa in February 2020. The sponsorship does not extend to the club's women's team, who for the first time are able to sign their own shirt sponsor. Previous sponsors include SportPesa (2017\u201320), Chang Beer (2004\u201317) Hafnia (1979\u201385), NEC (1985\u201395), Danka (1995\u201397), one2one (1997\u20132002) and Kejian (2002\u201304). For the 2008\u201309 season, Everton sold junior replica jerseys without the current name or logo of its main sponsor Chang beer, which followed a recommendation from the Portman Group that alcoholic brand names be removed from kits sold to children.Everton's current kit manufacturers \u2013 since the 2020\u201321 season \u2013 are Hummel, after a previous deal with Umbro was terminated early by the club. Umbro have been the club's kit manufacturer four times (1974\u201383, 1986\u20132000, 2004\u201309, and 2014\u201320). Other previous manufacturing firms are Le Coq Sportif (1983\u201386, 2009\u201312), Puma (2000\u201304) and Nike (2012\u201314).The club currently has two 'megastores': one located near Goodison Park on Walton Lane named 'Everton One' and one located in the Liverpool One shopping complex named 'Everton Two', which gives the second store the address 'Everton Two, Liverpool One'.\n\nManagers\nThe club's current manager is Sean Dyche. There have also been four caretaker managers, and before 1939 the team was selected by either the club secretary or by committee. The club's longest-serving manager has been Harry Catterick, who was in charge of the team from 1961 to 1973 for 594 first team matches. The Everton manager to win the most domestic and international trophies is Howard Kendall, who won two First Division championships, the 1984 FA Cup, the 1985 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, and three FA Charity Shields.\n\nRecords and statistics\nNeville Southall holds the record for the most Everton appearances with 751 first-team matches between 1981 and 1997. The late centre half and former captain Brian Labone comes in second with 534 matches. The longest serving player is goalkeeper Ted Sagar, who played for 23 years between 1929 and 1953. This tenure covered both sides of the Second World War and included a total of 495 appearances. Southall also previously held the record for the most league clean sheets during a season with 15. However, this record was beaten during the 2008\u201309 season by American goalkeeper Tim Howard, who ended the season with 17 clean sheets. The club's top goalscorer, with 383 goals in all competitions, is Dixie Dean; the second-highest goalscorer is Graeme Sharp with 159. Dean still holds the English national record of most goals in a season with 60.The record attendance for an Everton home match is 78,299 against Liverpool on 18 September 1948. Remarkably, there was only one injury at this game, which occurred when Tom Fleetwood was hit on the head by a coin thrown from the crowd whilst he marched around the perimeter and played the cornet with St Edward's Orphanage Band. Goodison Park, like all major English football grounds since the recommendations of the Taylor Report were implemented, is now an all-seater and only holds just under 40,000, meaning it is unlikely that this attendance record will ever be broken at Goodison. Everton's record transfer paid was to Swansea City for the Icelandic midfielder Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson for a sum of \u00a345m in 2017. The sale of Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United was for an initial sum of \u00a375m, a record fee between two English clubs and the largest sum Everton has received for a player.\nEverton holds the record for the most seasons in England's top tier (Division One/Premier League), with 119 seasons out of 123, as of completion of the 2021-22 season (the club played in Division 2 in 1930\u201331 and from 1951 to 1954). It is one of six teams to have played in every season of the Premier League since its inception in August 1992 \u2013 the others being Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur. Everton against Aston Villa is the most played fixture in England's top flight. As of the 2012\u201313 season, the two founding members of the Football League have played a record 196 league games.\n\nEverton's community department\nEverton's community department, Everton in the Community (EitC), is a charity that provides sports and other social activities for the local community including for people with disabilities. EitC represents the club in the European Multisport Club Association.\n\nRelationships with other clubs\nEverton is connected to many other sports clubs and organisations. It has links with Irish football academy Ballyoulster United in Celbridge, the Canadian Ontario Soccer Association, and the Thai Football Association (where there is a competition named the Chang-Everton Cup, competed for by local schoolboys). The club also has a football academy in the Cypriot city of Limassol and a partnership agreement with American club Pittsburgh Riverhounds.Everton has links with Chilean team Everton de Vi\u00f1a del Mar, who were named after the club. On 4 August 2010, the two Evertons played each other in a friendly match at Goodison Park named the \"Copa Hermandad\" to mark the centenary of the Chilean team. The occasion was organised by the Ruleteros Society, which was founded to promote connections between the two clubs. Other Everton clubs also exist in Colonia in Uruguay, La Plata and R\u00edo Cuarto in Argentina, Elk Grove in the U.S. state of California, and Cork in Ireland. There was also a team named Everton in Trinidad and Tobago. There was an Everton club in Auckland, New Zealand from 1907 to 1915 named because of the first FA Cup win.The club owned and operated a professional basketball team by the name of the Everton Tigers, who competed in the top-tier British Basketball League. The team was launched in the summer of 2007 as part of the club's Community programme and played its home games at the Greenbank Sports Academy in Liverpool's Mossley Hill suburb. The team was an amalgam of the Toxteth Tigers community youth programme, which started in 1968. The team quickly became one of the most successful in the league by winning the BBL Cup in 2009 and the play-offs in 2010. However, Everton withdrew funding before the 2010\u201311 season and the team was re-launched as the Mersey Tigers.\n\nIn popular culture\nFilm and TV\nKen Loach's 1969 television film The Golden Vision combined improvised drama with documentary footage to tell the story of a group of Everton fans for whom the main purpose of life\u2014following the team\u2014is interrupted by such inconveniences as work and weddings. Everton forward Alex Young, whose nickname was also the title of the film, appeared as himself.Paul Greengrass's 1997 television film The Fix dramatised the true story of a match-fixing scandal in which the club's newest player Tony Kay (played by Jason Isaacs) is implicated in having helped to throw a match between his previous club Sheffield Wednesday and Ipswich Town. The majority of the story is set during Everton's 1962\u201363 League Championship winning season, with then-manager Harry Catterick played by Colin Welland.In the 2015 Rocky film Creed, Goodison Park serves as the venue of the climactic fight scene. Footage of the stadium and crowd during a home game against West Bromwich Albion was used for the scene. Liverpool-born boxing champion Tony Bellew, a lifelong Everton fan, plays Creed's opponent and wore the Everton badge on his training gear and shorts.\n\nMusic\nThe club entered the UK singles chart on four occasions under different titles during the 1980s and 1990s, when many clubs each released a song to mark reaching the FA Cup Final. \"The Boys in Blue\", released in 1984, peaked at No. 82. The following year, the club scored its biggest hit when \"Here We Go\" peaked at No. 14. In 1986, Everton released \"Everybody's Cheering the Blues\", which reached No. 83. \"All Together Now\", a reworking of a song by Liverpool band The Farm, was released for the 1995 FA Cup final and reached No. 27. By the time the club reached the 2009 FA Cup final, the tradition had largely been abandoned by all clubs and no song was released.\n\nSee also\nNotes\nPassage 2:\n1914 FA Cup Final\nThe 1914 FA Cup final was a football match between Burnley and Liverpool on 25 April 1914 at Crystal Palace, London. It was the final match of the 1913\u201314 FA Cup, the 43rd season of the country's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup, better known as the FA Cup. Both teams were appearing in their first final.Both teams entered the competition in the first round. Burnley's matches ranged from comfortable victories to close affairs. They beat Bolton Wanderers 3\u20130 in the third round, but beat Sheffield United 1\u20130 in a replay of their semi-final which finished 0\u20130. Liverpool matches were generally close affairs, two of their five ties went to a replay. Apart from a 5\u20131 victory in their third round replay against West Ham United, their biggest margin of victory was by two goals.\nWatched by a crowd of 72,778, including King George V, who became the first reigning monarch to attend a FA Cup Final and to present the trophy to the winners, the first half was goalless. Burnley opened the scoring the 57th minute, when ex-Evertonian Bert Freeman scored. Liverpool could not find an equaliser in the remaining minutes and Burnley won the match 1\u20130 to win their first and to date only FA Cup.\nThe match was the last FA Cup Final to be played at Crystal Palace.\n\nMatch\nDetails\nPassage 3:\nSingapore FA Cup\nThe Singapore FA Cup, (also known as the Singapore Pools FA Cup for sponsorship reasons), is an annual football competition in Singapore.Initially held for clubs from the S.League from 1996-1998, the Football Association of Singapore decided to change format of the cup to allow only teams from National Football League to take part in the knock out competition from 1999,\nso that the S.League clubs can focus on Singapore Cup, competition created in 1998.After the Singapore Cup and earlier League Cup, Singapore FA Cup is the next major cup competition in Singapore. For a number of years, the FA Cup was solely restricted to NFL clubs. In 2006, S.League clubs were once again allowed in the competition, but were only permitted to field their developmental Prime League teams. The team matchups were drawn out of a hat against one another for the initial 2006 and 2007 seasons, before being seeded into two groups since 2008.\n\nResults\nNote: \nTampines Rovers SC is a separate entity from Tampines Rovers.\nSAFSA is a separate entity from Singapore Armed Forces.\nPolice SA is a separate entity from Home United (formerly Police FC).\nPassage 4:\nPeter Till\nPeter Till (born 7 September 1985) is an English former professional footballer who played as a winger.\nHe has played in the Football League for Scunthorpe United, Boston United, Leyton Orient, Grimsby Town, Chesterfield and Walsall.

Tony Butcher of Cod Almighty described him as an \"instant hit with wonderful wingery\" on his debut in a 2\u20130 victory over Accrington Stanley on 25 November 2006. After impressing manager Alan Buckley during his loan at Blundell Park, Grimsby agreed a deal with Birmingham and offered Till a permanent contract. He eventually joined Grimsby on a two-and-a-half-year contract on 5 January 2007, having already made seven appearances for the team during the 2006\u201307 season.

Villa play at Villa Park while Birmingham play at St Andrew's, the two grounds separated by roughly 2.4 miles (3.9 km). It is known as the Second City Derby based on Birmingham being referred to as the second city of the United Kingdom. The two clubs are generally regarded as each other's most fierce rivals. In addition both sides have affiliated women's sides, Aston Villa W.F.C. and Birmingham City W.F.C.\n\nHistory\nThe clubs first met on 27 September 1879, when Birmingham City were called Small Heath Alliance. The game, on a pitch at Small Heath's Muntz Street ground described by the Villa players as \"only suitable for pot-holing\", finished 1\u20130 \u2013 recorded as \"one goal and a disputed goal to nil\" \u2013 to the home side. Villa won the first competitive game between the clubs, in the Second Round of the FA Cup at Wellington Road in 1887, by four goals to nil, and their first league encounter, in the First Division in the 1894\u201395 season, 2\u20131.The two teams have engaged in several hotly contested matches. In the 1925 league game at Villa Park, with the home side 3\u20130 ahead with eleven minutes to go, Blues scored three times in a dramatic final spell to draw the match. The following year, Aston Villa made headlines with the signing of Tom 'Pongo' Waring, and his first appearance was for the reserves against Birmingham City's reserves, which famously drew a crowd of 23,000. Waring scored three times in the match.The most significant clash was the final of the 1963 League Cup, which was staged not long after Aston Villa had beaten Birmingham City 4\u20130 in the league. Blues won 3\u20131 on aggregate over the two-legged final to claim their first major domestic honour.During the late 1970s to early 1980s both Villa and Blues met regularly in the First Division and both teams had some memorable successes in the fixture. In 1980\u201381 Villa did the double over Blues and went on to win the First Division title. Blues scored a memorable 3\u20130 victory at St Andrew's in the first meeting following Villa's European Cup triumph in 1982. Both teams promptly went into decline. Blues racked up a 3\u20130 win in a relegation battle at Villa Park in March 1986 but were relegated at the end of that season. Villa would be demoted the following campaign. The next time Villa met Blues in a league fixture at Villa Park again was in the Second Division and saw a 2\u20130 Blues victory. The reverse fixture at St Andrew's was a 2\u20131 Villa victory with both goals coming from Garry Thompson. The two sides would only meet again in the 1980s in cup competitions. Villa won 7\u20130 on aggregate when they clashed twice in the 1988\u201389 League Cup. The same season Villa also won a Full Members Cup clash 6\u20130.\n\nThe Premier League Era\nFollowing the creation of the Premier League, Aston Villa and Birmingham City met twice in the second round of the 1993\u201394 League Cup. Villa won both matches 1\u20130. The game at St Andrew's was settled by a Kevin Richardson goal after his keeper Mark Bosnich had saved a penalty from John Frain to keep the game at 0\u20130. The second leg at Villa Park was notable for a winning goal from Villa's Dean Saunders and a red card for Blues' Paul Tait. Villa went on to win the trophy.\nBlues' promotion to the Premier League in 2002 saw fans eagerly anticipating the first league derbies in 15 years. Blues won both derbies 3\u20130 and 2\u20130, respectively. Both matches saw goalkeeping errors by Villa goalkeeper Peter Enckelman, including a goal scored directly from an Olof Mellberg throw-in. Violence between both sets of fans occurred before both matches as evening kick-off times had allowed fans to get drunk over the course of the day. In March 2003, during the game at Villa Park, two Villa players were sent off, Dion Dublin for a head-butt on Blues' Robbie Savage and Joey Gu\u00f0j\u00f3nsson for a reckless two-footed tackle on Matthew Upson. Trouble also took place following the game on Witton Lane outside Villa Park, where missiles were hurled at police who were attempting to keep both sets of fans apart.\nThe 2003\u201304 Premiership season saw games ending in 0\u20130 and 2\u20132 draws. The 2\u20132 draw saw Blues recover a two-goal deficit thanks to a 90th-minute equaliser from Stern John. Both games were lunchtime kick-offs to avoid drunken behaviour, which was achieved although the games lost none of their passionate edge. The following season Blues got back to winning ways, with 2\u20131 victory at Villa Park just before Christmas and 2\u20130 at home in March, Villa keeper Thomas S\u00f8rensen making mistakes in both matches, though it's debatable if his errors directly affected the respective results. In the 2005\u201306 Premiership Season, Villa finally beat Blues in the Premiership, thanks to a Kevin Phillips goal. This was followed up by another Villa victory on 16 April 2006, Easter Sunday, with Aston Villa winning 3\u20131 thanks to two goals from Milan Baro\u0161 and a bicycle kick from Gary Cahill. Blues were relegated in 2006 but subsequently promoted in 2007.\nIn November 2007, Villa won their third consecutive derby match with a 2\u20131 victory at St Andrew's. Former Villa defender Liam Ridgewell scored an own goal to put Villa 1\u20130 up, Blues equalised through Mikael Forssell only for Gabriel Agbonlahor to clinch it with a late header for Villa, having cleared off his own line seconds before. Violent clashes took place outside the ground after the game in which over 20 police officers were hurt. The derby on 20 April 2008 between the two sides ended in a 5\u20131 win for Aston Villa at Villa Park, the biggest winning margin for either side in a league match for 40 years.\nVilla continued their winning ways in the derby, when they won both of the meetings between the clubs in the 2009\u201310 Premier League season. The first took place on 13 September 2009 at St Andrew's, and ended 1\u20130 to Aston Villa, with Agbonlahor scoring the winner in the 85th minute, once again there was trouble with 14 arrests. Villa then went on to beat Blues 1\u20130 at Villa Park thanks to a disputed penalty from James Milner in the 82nd minute. This was the 3rd time in 4 derbies that Villa had scored the winning goal in the final 10 minutes of the game. Villa also possess the record of six straight wins from 1987 to 1993, including five cup matches. This record was then achieved in the Premier League after Villa beat Blues 1\u20130 on 25 April 2010, setting a record of six straight league wins from 2005 to 2010. The record was finally ended at the next derby match on 31 October 2010, which resulted in a 0\u20130 draw at Villa Park. The return match at St Andrew's also ended in a draw, with it finishing 1\u20131.\nIn those games in October and December 2010 where Aston Villa played Birmingham City, at Villa Park (Premier League, 31 October) and St Andrew's (League Cup, 1 December, which was the first mid-week game between the two sides since 2003) violence between the two sets of supporters and hooligan firms occurred, with many fans being arrested. In the first game, there were scenes of violence outside Villa Park and there were a small amount of arrests including a Birmingham City club chef. In the second of the two games (and larger scale violence) after Blues had beaten Villa 2\u20131, Blues supporters came onto the pitch and confronted the visiting Villa fans, this resulted in flares, ripped out seats and other missiles being hurled by Villa fans into the Blues supporters, there were also flash points before and after the game including the attack on a Blues supporters pub by Villa hooligans, the events were described as a \"warzone\" by a supporter who attended the game. Birmingham City were later fined \u00a340,000 by the Football Association for failing to control their fans.On 10 April 2011, an episode of Police Academy UK, a TV show aired on BBC Three which documents overseas police officers' introduction to British crime and policing, was set in Birmingham and covered the violence that occurred at the game between Birmingham City and Aston Villa on 1 December 2010.On 17 June 2011, Birmingham City manager Alex McLeish swapped Blues for Villa in a move that shocked the football world. The reaction from both sets of supporters was one of anger. Blues supporters were angry at McLeish, who guided them to only their second ever major trophy win in February 2011, for betraying them to join bitter rivals Villa, and Villa fans were unhappy with the appointment of a manager that had got Blues relegated twice in four seasons, and was perceived to play a negative style of football; that he came from Blues only served to rub salt into the wound of the board making such an unambitious and negative appointment. Several hundred Villa supporters protested at Villa Park when it emerged that Villa owner Randy Lerner has begun talks with McLeish. McLeish received death threats from followers of both teams following his appointment as Aston Villa manager. This controversial move only increased tension and hostility between the players, supporters and owners of both clubs even more as Blues directors threatened legal action against Villa for allegedly \"tapping up\" McLeish, who resigned as Blues manager on 12 June 2011, while he was still under contract at Birmingham City. McLeish's appointment marked the first time in history that a manager had moved directly from Birmingham City to Aston Villa. On 14 May 2012, one day after the 2011\u201312 Premier League season ended, McLeish was sacked as Villa manager after a massively disappointing one season in charge.\n\nThe EFL Championship Era\nAfter being relegated in 2011, Birmingham are still yet to gain promotion back to the top flight of English football. However, since Alex McLeish was sacked as Villa manager, Villa's poor form continued. Despite several manager changes over the next few years, after several close calls they were finally relegated at the end of the 2015/16 season. Earlier on in the 2015/16 season, the two teams were drawn to play each other in the third round of the League Cup. Aston Villa ran out 1\u20130 winners thanks to a goal from Rudy Gestede. \nIn the 2016\u201317 season the two teams faced off in the second tier of English football for the first time since 1987. The first game at St Andrew's ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Villa won the second match 1\u20130 with a 69th-minute goal scored by Agbonlahor. The two sides faced each other again in the league during the 2017/18 season, producing a dismal 0\u20130 draw at St. Andrews marred by Birmingham fans throwing clappers at the Villa players all throughout the game, before Villa emphatically fortified their second city superiority with a 2\u20130 victory in front of 41,232 spectators at Villa Park. Some fans believed this game to be a coming of age for lifelong Villa fan and local Jack Grealish, who produced a match-winning man-of-the-match display. \nThe teams next met on 25 November in one of the most exciting derby games in recent times, Villa ran out 4-2 winners after goals from Jonathan Kodjia, Jack Grealish, a Tammy Abraham penalty and Alan Hutton who ran half the length of the pitch to score, Pedersen and Lukas Jutkiewicz scored for Birmingham.On 10 March 2019, a Birmingham City fan invaded the pitch during the reverse fixture at St. Andrew's and assaulted Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish on the pitch by punching him from behind in the head, which was labelled as \"disgraceful and cowardly\" by supporters of both teams. The man was arrested and charged by West Midlands Police. St Andrew's' security was criticised as a result. The game ended in an ironic twist with a 1\u20130 win for Aston Villa with Grealish scoring the winning goal. At the end of the same season, Villa were promoted as they won ten in a row including that game. Since then, this fiercely contested fixture hasn't been played between the two rivals.\n\nWomen's Sides\nBirmingham City W.F.C. were founded in 1968, whilst Aston Villa W.F.C. were founded in 1973 as Solihull F.C., and took on their current Aston Villa guise in 1996. During the 2000-01 and 2001-02 seasons both teams competed in the second tier FA Women's Premier League North. Birmingham were then promoted to the Women's Premier League National with Villa joining them for one season in 2003-04 before being relegated. Then followed 18 years of the teams being in different divisions, Birmingham being in the top tier and Villa elsewhere, until the 2020\u201321 Women's Super League season when Villa were promoted up to join Blues. In the first ever WSL match between the two sides Birmingham beat Villa 1\u20130 at an empty Villa Park (due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom), while the Birmingham's home match which was also played behind closed doors at Damson Park, Solihull was a 1\u20131 draw. In the 2021\u201322 season, Aston Villa won 1\u20130 at St. Andrew's. Birmingham returned the favour and won 1\u20130 at Villa Park on 8 May 2022, the final day of the season, as they were relegated to the FA Women's Championship.As of the 2021\u201322 Birmingham currently play at St Andrew's, home of the men's team, having played at Redditch Utd, Stratford Town and Solihull Moors in the 21st century. Villa play at Walsall's Bescot Stadium, having moved from Boldmere St Michaels - although important games such as the Second City Derby will often take place at Villa Park.\n\nStatistics and records\nAs of the end of the 2010\u201311 season, there have been 120 meetings in major competition between the two teams since the first FA Cup meeting in 1887, of which Aston Villa have won 52 and Birmingham City 38. The most goals in one game were scored in a league game on 7 July 1895, in the First Division, as Small Heath lost to Aston Villa 7\u20133. The biggest winning margin was 6\u20130 to Aston Villa on 9 November 1988, in a Full Members Cup fixture. The last Birmingham City league victory over Aston Villa was on 20 March 2005, when Blues won 2\u20130 at St Andrew's. Villa won six encounters in a row, most recently on 25 April 2010 (2005\u20132010). The two teams drew for the first time in over six years in the next match (the first of three in the 2010\u201311 season), with the match finishing 0\u20130 (the other Premier League match of the season also finished as a draw). The second match of the season resulted in the first Blues win since 2005, as they beat Villa 2\u20131 in the 2010\u201311 League Cup Quarter Final on 1 December 2010.\n\nAll-time results\nCup matches\nWomen's matches\nSummary of results\nStats correct as of 10 March 2019.\n\nRecords\nFirsts\nFirst competitive meeting: Aston Villa 4\u20130 Small Heath Alliance (FA Cup), 5 November 1887.\nFirst league meeting: Aston Villa 2\u20131 Small Heath, 1 September 1894.\nFirst away victory for Aston Villa: Small Heath 1\u20134 Aston Villa, 26 October 1895.\nFirst away victory for Birmingham City: Aston Villa 1\u20133 Birmingham, 20 January 1906.\n\nResults\nHighest scoring game: Aston Villa 7\u20133 Small Heath, 7 September 1895.\nLargest winning margin (Aston Villa): 6 goals \u2013 6\u20130, 9 November 1988.\nLargest winning margin (Birmingham City): 4 goals \u2013 4\u20130, 21 September 1968.\n\nPlayers\nMost goals in a match (Aston Villa):\nMost goals in a match (Birmingham City):\n\nTrends\nMost games won in a row (Aston Villa): 6, 16 October 2005 to 25 April 2010.\nMost games won in a row (Birmingham City): 5, 3 April 1976 \u2013 25 February 1978.\nMost games without defeat (Aston Villa): 14, 16 October 2005 \u2013 on going\nMost games without defeat (Birmingham City): 6, 8 March 1933 \u2013 23 November 1935 and 16 September 2002 \u2013 20 March 2005.\nMost drawn games in a row: 4, 10 December 1949 \u2013 21 September 1955.\nWhenever the clubs have met in the Premier League the result has always been the same during that particular season: 2002/2003\u2013 2 Blues wins, 2003/2004\u2013 2 draws, 2004/2005\u2013 2 Blues wins, 2005/2006\u2013 2 Villa Wins, 2007/2008\u2013 2 Villa wins, 2009/2010\u2013 2 Villa wins, 2010/11- 2 draws.\n\nTop scorers\nThe following is a list of the top goal scorers for each team in the fixture. Only players who have scored 4 or more goals feature.\n\nCrossing the divide\nPlayers\nUnlike, for example, the Old Firm derby, there is no shortage of players who have appeared for both clubs. Villa legend Harry Hampton transferred to Blues after the First World War and helped the club to the Second Division title. The last established first-team player to make this move was Des Bremner in 1984, though there had been loan signings and movement of youth players during this period. The most recent permanent transfer from Aston Villa to Birmingham City was that of Gary Gardner in Summer 2019, his brother Craig was the previous player to move from Villa to Birmingham in 2010. The last player to move directly in the other direction was Spanish Winger Jota in the same transfer window.\nNotable players who have been transferred directly between the clubs are listed below.\n\nAston Villa to Birmingham City\nNotes\nThe players listed above made a direct transfer from Villa to Blues. In addition, there are several players who have \"crossed the divide\" but done so via another league club.\nEuropean Cup winner Dennis Mortimer \u2013 regarded by Villa fans as one of their greatest ever players \u2013 also played for Birmingham City in the 1986/7 season.\nKevin Phillips played for Villa in the 2005/06 season before moving to Blues in 2008 via West Bromwich Albion.\n\nBirmingham City to Aston Villa\nNotes\nThe players listed above made a direct transfer from Blues to Villa. In addition, there are several high-profile players who have \"crossed the divide\" but done so via another league club. Notable examples include former England international Emile Heskey and European Cup winner Peter Withe.\nChris Sutton was released by Birmingham City at the end of the 2005\u201306 season. His next club was Aston Villa, for whom he signed for in October 2006.\nScott Sinclair has played on loan at both clubs. He was on loan at Birmingham City while he was playing for Chelsea during the 2008\u201309 season and he was on loan at Aston Villa during the 2014\u201315 season before signing permanently from Manchester City.\n\nManagers\nFormer Aston Villa Manager Ron Saunders, who managed Villa to League Cup success in 1975 and again in 1977 before taking the club to its first Championship success for 70 years in 1981, also moved across to Birmingham City following his resignation in 1982.\nAlex McLeish's appointment as Aston Villa manager in June 2011 after resigning from Birmingham City five days before was the first time in history a manager has moved from Birmingham City to Aston Villa. The move shocked the football world and increased tension between the two clubs even more.Former Birmingham City Manager Steve Bruce was appointed Villa manager in 2016.\n\nAston Villa to Birmingham City\nBirmingham City to Aston Villa\nChairmen\nDoug Ellis was a director of Birmingham City in the late 1960s before becoming part of a consortium which took over at Aston Villa in 1968.\n\nSee also\nAston Villa Hardcore (hooligan firm)\nBirmingham Zulu Warriors (hooligan firm)\nList of Aston Villa F.C. seasons\nList of Birmingham City F.C. seasons\nList of Aston Villa F.C. records and statistics\nList of Birmingham City F.C. records and statistics\nPassage 6:\n1894\u201395 FA Cup\nThe 1894\u201395 FA Cup was the 24th season of the world's oldest association football competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (more usually known as the FA Cup). The cup was won by Aston Villa, who defeated West Bromwich Albion 1\u20130 in the final of the competition, played at Crystal Palace in London. This was Villa's second victory in the FA Cup.\nThe Trophy was stolen from a display in the shop window of W. Shillcock (a football fitter) in Newton Row, Birmingham, after the Final and never recovered despite a \u00a310 reward. According to the Police, it was taken sometime between 21:30 on Wednesday 11 September and 7:30 the following morning, along with cash from a drawer. The cup was replaced by a copy of the original, made by Howard Vaughton, the former Aston Villa player and England international, who had opened a silversmith's business after his retirement from the game.\nMatches were scheduled to be played at the stadium of the team named first on the date specified for each round, which was always a Saturday. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played, a replay would take place at the stadium of the second-named team later the same week. If the replayed match was drawn further replays would be held at neutral venues until a winner was determined. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played in a replay, a 30-minute period of extra time would be played.\n\nCalendar\nThe format of the FA Cup for the season had a preliminary round, four qualifying rounds, three proper rounds, and the semi-finals and final.\n\nFirst round proper\nThe first round proper contained sixteen ties between 32 teams. The 16 First Division sides were given a bye to this round, as were Notts County, Darwen, Bury, Newcastle United, Newton Heath and Woolwich Arsenal from the Second Division. The other Second Division sides were entered into the first round qualifying, with the exceptions of Burton Swifts, who started in the second round qualifying, and Manchester City, who played no part in the season's competition. Of the qualifying League sides, only Burton Wanderers and Leicester Fosse qualified to the FA Cup proper. Eight non-league sides also qualified.\nThe matches were played on Saturday, 2 February 1895. One match was drawn, with the replay taking place in the following midweek fixture. The Barnsley St Peter's \u2013 Liverpool game was voided following a dispute over extra time being played.  The match was replayed nine days later, resulting in a 4\u20130 win to Liverpool.\n\nSecond round proper\nThe eight Second Round matches were scheduled for Saturday, 16 February 1895. There were two replays, played in the following midweek fixture.\n\nThird round proper\nThe four Third Round matches were scheduled for Saturday, 2 March 1895. There were no replays.\n\nSemi-finals\nThe semi-final matches were both played on Saturday, 16 March 1895. Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion went on to meet in the final at Crystal Palace.\n\nFinal\nThe Final was contested by Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion at Crystal Palace. Aston Villa won 1\u20130, with Bob Chatt being credited with scoring the fastest goal in FA Cup Final history, scored after just 30 seconds.

    "Passage 1:\nNickelodeon (film)\nNickelodeon is a 1976 comedy film directed by Peter Bogdanovich, and stars Ryan O'Neal, Burt Reynolds and Tatum O'Neal. According to Bogdanovich, the film was based on true stories told to him by silent film directors Allan Dwan and Raoul Walsh. It was entered into the 27th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nPlot\nIn 1914, Leo Harrigan (Ryan O'Neal) goes from being a lawyer to a writer and then to a film director while having problems, such as being hopelessly smitten with Kathleen Cooke.\nWhile directing a scene of his friend Buck rising in a balloon, Kathleen gets trapped in a rope and is hoisted in a most undignified manner. They keep filming, including the balloon crashing onto a moving train. As the footage is excellent, they incorporate it into the film and rewrite the story to fit. Kathleen therefore accidentally becomes the leading lady.\nDue to Kathleen's life being saved by Buck in the balloon they are now engaged. After shooting a scene where they get married they drive off to really wed.\nWhen they go to a small town nickelodeon, they are surprised to see a film Tuttle's Muddle which is a spliced version of the ten films which they have made to date. Their attitude changes when the audience follow them, recognising them as the stars of the film. The group are offered a contract by Atlantic Pictures who are relocating to the Pacific and they all head to Hollywood.\nLeo moves from New Jersey to California to keep one step ahead of the Motion Picture Patents Company, which is out to destroy any non-authorized equipment violating the Edison Trust. Leo finally settles in with other filmmakers in Hollywoodland, California, and makes a series of dramatic, romantic, and comedic shorts as throwaways.\nWhile initially believing movies are just a brief flickering kind of entertainment, Leo and the crew are profoundly affected when they go to see the 1915 world premiere of D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation, which transforms the motion picture industry. The film gets a standing ovation and Leo is left feeling inadequate. After the film, they re-encounter Cobb who speaks to camera enthusing about what the cinema can bring. He wants Leo to make a film about the war, getting \"what war?\" in response.\n\nCast\nRyan O'Neal as Leo Harrigan\nBurt Reynolds as Buck Greenway\nTatum O'Neal as Alice Forsyte\nJane Hitchcock as Kathleen Cooke\nBrian Keith as H.H. Cobb\nStella Stevens as Marty Reeves\nJohn Ritter as Franklin Frank\nBrion James as Bailiff\nSidney Armus as Judge\nJoe Warfield as Defence Attorney\nLorenzo Music as Mullins\nJeffrey Byron as Steve\nPriscilla Pointer as Mabel\nPhilip Bruns as Duncan\nFrank Marshall as Dinsdale's Assistant\nHarry Carey, Jr. as Dobie\nJames Best as Jim\nGeorge Gaynes as Reginald Kingsley\nM.

He took the idea to W.D. Richter, with whom he had worked a number of times, and Richter agreed to write the project on \"spec\" for the producers (Winkler's producing partner was Bob Chartoff). Richter's final script was called Starlight Parade, and attracted interest from United Artists and Columbia. David Begelman at Columbia suggested Peter Bogdanovich as director.Winkler later stated:\n\nHe made David come to his office and wait until the receptionist said: 'Mr. Bogdanovich will see you now.' As soon as we came inside, we were very haughtily told that he thought the script was a piece of [garbage]. I'd been around long enough to know that I should take that as a bad sign. I remember coming out of the meeting, saying, 'David, why should we make the movie with someone who hates our script?' And all David said was, 'Hey, he's a genius.' ... What he filmed had nothing to do with the original script. I know it meant a lot to Peter to have all of the authentic stories about the silent period in the film, but Rick's script, authentic or not, was terrific. It was just a great drama. By the time Peter was done with it, it was authentic, but it wasn't dramatic anymore. Peter hadn't really experienced any failure yet \u2014  we hired him before At Long Last Love had come out - so he was easily the most arrogant person I'd ever met in the business, before or since. When we shot the picture, he actually directed some of the scenes on horseback. When I asked him why he was on horseback, he said: \"Because that's the way John Ford did it.'\"\nBogdanovich has an alternative version:\n\nI should have never gotten involved, I should have done it myself. I'd been planning to do a big picture about the silent era, largely based on the interviews with Dwan, Walsh and McCarey. I was preparing it and I got a call from my agent and she said they're preparing a movie called Starlight Parade, there's another director involved but they want you. I said, \"Well, I don't really want to do their script, I'll have to rewrite it completely.\" \"They'll let you rewrite it, whatever you want.\" Basically I rewrote the whole damn thing and never used any of Starlight Parade. The trouble was, again, the picture had a balance between comedy and drama and it was a comedy-drama, no question about it, and I had wanted to do it in black and white. It was very important to do it in black and white and Columbia, the studio, wouldn't let me. I had a big fight about that and they cancelled the picture. Then Barry Spikings at British-Lion came in and funded some of the picture, threw in a few million dollars. It ended up being a Columbia-British Lion picture and but when it was all done it was a difficult picture.\nThe movie's title was eventually changed to Nickelodeon.\n\nCasting\nBogdanovich said his original choices for the leads were Jeff Bridges, John Ritter, Cybill Shepherd and Orson Welles. However Columbia Pictures head David Begelman refused and Burt Reynolds and Ryan O'Neal were cast in the leads. He also refused to let Bogdanovich's then-girlfriend Shepherd in the female lead out of fear of a public backlash against her, following the poor box office performance of Daisy Miller and At Long Last Love. Brian Keith played the part Bogdanovich wanted Welles to play. (He later said he was going to play it at one stage.) Of Bogdanovich's original picks for the leads, only Ritter was cast, in a smaller role, as cameraman Franklin Frank in what would be the first of three collaborations between him and Bogdanovich (the other two being 1981's They All Laughed, and 1992's Noises Off.)\n\"The character I play ... is a sort of a Gary Cooper with a little Buster Keaton thrown in\", said Reynolds. \"I do a lot of pratfalls and fall into things. He's a very shy, sweet, and likeable character. This is a first for me. The part that I would normally play is being played by Ryan O'Neal. He's a fast talking guy trying to become a big success. Peter wrote the film for Ryan O'Neal and me; he sees me [in real life] as that shy guy.\"Tatum O'Neal, who had won an Oscar appearing in Paper Moon with her father and Bogdanovich, joined the supporting cast.\nThe fees for Reynolds and O'Neal were around $750,000, and Tatum O'Neal was $350,000. This caused the budget to increase and Columbia cancelled the film.\n\"This film is not over and done with\", said Richter in November 1975. \"What it comes down to is a power struggle over the budget. Columbia wants an enormous hunk cut out of it and I think if we can cut if they will make the film. By its very nature it is an expensive project. Why the studio brought this to is another question. Maybe it is the beginning of an attempt to start cutting back stars' prices. I think it is criminal to have to shorten the film just to pay a kings ransom to stars. You end up in debt before you begin.\"Extra finance was obtained by British Lion and it was announced that filming would proceed. \"We have worked out 99% of the problems and expect to work out 100% of the creative differences\", said David Begelman in December 1975.Columbia provided $6 million, British Lion $2 million. The director's fee was $700,000, $500,000 of which was held as a completion guarantee.Bogdanovich later said the film \"didn't have to cost half as much as it did. The producers insisted it be bigger and I fought but I finally had to accept what they wanted.\"\n\nShooting\n\"The whole idea was to capture the era, since obviously the original films were shot in black and white\", Bogdanovich says. \"My cinematographer, Laszlo Kovacs, carefully lit everything to accommodate black-and-white, which is why the lighting looks so good. We used a lot of the techniques of the silent era, irising in and out of scenes. There are no opticals at all in the film. But all the studio wanted was another broad comedy like What's Up, Doc? \"During filming, Burt Reynolds collapsed on set one day. Doctors could not figure out what was wrong with him and the film had to be postponed for two weeks while he recovered. The film went over schedule and over budget and Bogdanovich had to forfeit his $500,000.\"I just had a smaller picture in mind\", said the director later. \"Both Burt Reynolds and Ryan were good in it, and Jane Hitchcock was good but she didn't have any threat about her.\"Ryan O'Neal had made two pictures previously with Bogdanovich but said Nickelodeon was a \"terrible experience\" and that Bogdanovich \"began no longer using writers ... Orson Welles quit one week before he was to appear in the film ... Bogdanovich rewrote what originally was a tough little script about Hollywood into a farcical series of precious little jokes. I tried to get out of the picture. I told him, 'Peter we had a good script but you changed it. You're locked up there in your house. You've got to get out and regain the gritty edge you showed in Last Picture Show. But he never did.\"Reynolds and his stunt man Hal Needham had an unhappy experience making the film. They later made the film Hooper which featured a pretentious film director based on Bogdanovich.\n\nPost-production\nWinkler says when he saw a rough cut of the final film he thought it was \"atrocious ... for Peter to blame the movie's failure on the casting and not being in black-and-white is a really terrible excuse for a guy who simply screwed up a really terrific script.\"\n\nReception\nFor the Los Angeles premiere, all guests (and some critics) paid five cents to see the movie in honor of the film and early Hollywood ticket prices. However, the movie was unsuccessful at the box office, and was Bogdanovich's third flop in a row, after Daisy Miller and At Long Last Love (the latter of which was also an attempt to revive an older style of film making).\nBogdanovich reminisced in 2004:\n\nThe previews were edgy and the studio wanted me to take most of the drama out, play it more comedy and turn it more into a What's Up Doc?, which it really wasn't. So that threw it off and it got fucked up. Again, the picture came out not at all the way I wanted. I tried to recut that one and I couldn't get back to it. There's about five minutes I'd like to put back that really makes a difference, some heavy stuff where you find out that Ryan O'Neal has an affair with Stella Stevens, it becomes very clear, and you see that John Ritter knows it, all that stuff. It was just much heavier and darker. So the picture got screwed up and that's why I took three years off and went away.\nBogdanovich blamed the studio for poor marketing.\n\nI couldn't seem to get anything across to them. I felt like I was talking into a void. When you've had a few successes you can say the stupidest things in the world and people will think it's clever. When you've had a few flops, you can say something perfectly reasonable and they look at you as if they had no idea what you are talking about.\nAs for Richter;\n\nAfter it became clear the picture was a failure, the most amazing thing happened: I got more job offers than ever before in my life. People seemed so mad at Peter that they were eager to make excuses for me and help me out. And they all wanted to hear about working with him.\n\nAfter making the film, Bogdanovich felt he had compromised so much he took three years off directing, before returning with Saint Jack (1979).\nAmong contemporary reviews from critics, Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and called it \"a curiously flat movie. It functions like clockwork and it looks right, but it doesn't feel like much. The laughs are telegraphed, the actors are lifeless (with the exception of Burt Reynolds), and the movie does an abrupt turnabout, from comedy to elegy, about two-thirds of the way through.\" Richard Eder of The New York Times called the film \"two hours and two minutes of impersonations. Some of them are very good impersonations\u2014deft and funny\u2014but they lack a life to string them together.\" Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called it \"an okay comedy-drama about the early days of motion pictures. Recreating a cultural era in terms of some of its artistic forms and cliches emerges as an uneven dramatic device though it sometimes works.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four and wrote that it \"really bogs down with incessantly inept pratfall comedy\" and \"is successful only when it captures the innocence of the period.\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"In the first part of the film O'Neal, Reynolds and Miss Hitchcock often seem merely silly as they carry on like the exaggerated characters in their own movies. Alas, the effect is to make the latter portion of the movie unduly static and drawn out in comparison to its frenetic beginning. However, the more aware one is of what Bogdanovich is trying to do and the more knowledgeable one is about the era he is trying to evoke, the more enjoyable the movie. Indeed, 'Nickelodeon' is most affecting for the cineaste, and its culminating tribute to D. W. Griffith as the screen's first great artist brings tears to the eyes.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote that while Bogdanovich's new film was not quite a disaster on par with his previous flop At Long Last Love, \"this elaborate, rambling and ultimately tedious period comedy about the pioneering years of the movie business in Hollywood does not lack for crippling deficiencies, miscalculations and self-indulgences.\"Critic John Simon called the film \"a sanity test: anyone who catches himself laughing at any of it at this late date should seriously consider committing himself to the nearest mental hospital even though in his case a cure is hardly to be hoped for.\"As of March 2022, the film holds a rating of 8% on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 4.7 out of 10.\n\nAlternative versions\nThe 2009 DVD release includes a 125-minute \"Director's Cut\" in black and white. \"There's nothing to distract you\", said Bogdanovich, \"Ryan's blond hair and blue eyes don't distract you, and you focus on the action in an easier way. That's why the funniest movies ever made were silent comedies\u2014Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Charlie Chaplin.

Cassata is typically composed of a round sponge cake moistened with fruit juices or liqueur and layered with ricotta cheese and candied fruit (a filling also used with cannoli). Cassata has a shell of marzipan, pink and green coloured icing, and decorative designs. Cassata may also refer to a Neapolitan ice cream containing candied or dried fruit and nuts.\n\nOrigin\nCassata is believed to have originated in Palermo in the 10th century, when under Muslim rule. The word al-qa\u0161\u0161\u0101\u1e6d\u012b \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0634\u0627\u0637\u064a (Arabic for 'the cassata-maker') \u2013 was first mentioned in Corleone in 1178.The Arabic word qas'ah, from which cassata may derive, refers to the bowl that is used to shape the cake.\n\nVariations\nUnlike the round, traditional shape some cassata are made in the form of a rectangle, square, or box. The word \"box\" in Italian is cassa, although it is unlikely that the word cassata originated from this term.Cassata Catanese, as it is often prepared in the Sicilian province of Catania, is made similar to a pie, containing a top and bottom crust, filled with ricotta, and baked in the oven.\n\nThe Cassatella di sant'Agata (pl. cassatelle)\u2014colloquially named Minni di Vergini, meaning \"virgin breasts\"\u2014is a similar dessert, but made in a smaller, personal-serving size,  with a candied cherry on top, and often a specifically green-coloured marzipan. It is typically made in Catania for the festival of Saint Agatha. The allusion to the female breast relates the specific torture Saint Agatha faced as a Catholic martyr.When a cassata is made, layers of gelato (Italian ice cream) can be substituted for the layers of cheese, producing a dessert similar to an ice cream cake. The version of the recipe followed in Messina is less sweet than the one used in Palermo.\n\"Cassata\" can also refer to a flavor of ice-cream inspired by the sweet.\n\nUnited States\nIn Cleveland, Ohio and the surrounding region, the term \"Cassata Cake\" uniquely refers to a layered yellow sponge cake soaked in rum or rum syrup, filled with fresh strawberries and custard, and usually decorated with whipped cream and sliced strawberries. \nThis Cleveland version of the Cassata Cake first appeared in the early 1920s at LaPuma Spumoni & Bakery in Cleveland. The children of the owners did not like traditional cassata cake, made with sweetened ricotta and candied fruit. Using what he had in the bakery, Tomasso LaPuma created what was to become known as the Cleveland Cassata Cake. The fifth generation of this bakery, now located in the city's eastern suburb of Chesterland, still continues to make the original version of this cake, as do many other Italian bakeries in the area. The layered cake is served for special occasions such as weddings and large family events. Some local specialty bakers or restaurants, including several in Cleveland's Little Italy neighborhood, sell Cassata Cake by the slice or have adapted the cake to be sold with ingredients layered with in a jar to-go.\n\nSee also\nCannoli\nCrema de fruta\nTrifle\nTipsy cake\nPassage 6:\nGreen Party of Tennessee\nThe Green Party of the United States, also known as GPUS, is one of the two minor contemporary political parties in the United States with a sustained national presence, the other being the Libertarian Party. The Green Party has affiliated state parties in most states. However, not all state Green Parties are affiliated with GPUS, with those parties included separately in the following list.\n\nOrganizations of GPUS\nStandalone state parties\nAlaska\nThe Green Party of Alaska is a political party in the U.S. state of Alaska. It was the Alaska affiliate of the national state Green Party, up from its creation to 2021, due of the state party has broken the party rules over refused to recognize the nominated presidential candidate, Howie Hawkins in the 2020 presidential election.  Alaska was the first state to gain Green Party ballot access, in 1990, when Jim Sykes ran for governor.  Sykes had previously filed a ballot access lawsuit, citing an earlier case, Vogler v. Miller.\nLike the Alaska Libertarian Party, the Green Party organizes local affiliate groups by regions of the state rather than election districts.  It is known for calling these groups bioregions.  The organized bioregions of the GPAK include the Southcentral Bioregion (Anchorage area) and the Tanana-Yukon Bioregion (the Interior, around the Tanana and Yukon River areas).\n\nGeorgia\nThe Georgia Green Party is a state-level political party in Georgia. Their candidate for president in 2016 was Dr. Jill Stein. Stein was denied access to the ballot. The party sued and won at the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The state chapter was disaffiliated by the Green Party of the United States on June 26, 2021 due to the state chapter drafting and passing a platform amendment against the rights of transgender people, counter to the GPUS platform.\n\nRhode Island\nOSGP\nThe Ocean State Green Party (OSGP) is a  Green party in the United States. The party was founded in summer 2020, originally as a small group of supporters of the Hawkins-Walker 2020 campaign in Rhode Island. After the older Green Party of Rhode Island refused to support the presidential campaign, these supporters opted to reject this decision and collect signatures to gain a ballot line for the Green Party ticket. They then proceeded to file a complaint with the Accreditation Committee of the Green Party of the United States.\n\nGPRI\nThe Green Party of Rhode Island (GPRI) is one of the oldest active Green parties in the United States. The party was founded on March 6, 1992, at a meeting of 40 activists from Rhode Island. In November 1996, GPRI was one of 12 founding parties in the Association of State Green Parties, renamed the Green Party of the United States in 2001. Several Rhode Island party leaders have served as officers of the national Green Party.  The party's candidates run for municipal councils in several cities and towns, such as running for Mayor of Providence, the State Senate and the State House of Representatives, U.S. Congress, and for Lieutenant governor. The Green Party of Rhode Island was involved in nationwide Green politics, until 2020 when the state party leadership took the rogue position to refuse to place the Green nominee for President, Howie Hawkins, on the ballot. Rather than face deaccreditation, the state party ended its affiliation with GPUS.\n\nVirginia\nThe Independent Greens of Virginia, (also known as the Indy Greens), was the state affiliate of the Independence Party of America in the Commonwealth of Virginia. It became a state party around 2003 when a faction of the Arlington local chapter of the Green Party of Virginia (GPVA) split from the main party. As of 2011, it bills itself as a \"fiscally conservative, socially responsible green party\", with an emphasis on rail transportation and \"more candidates\". In support of wider ballot participation, it endorses many independent candidates who are not affiliated with the party.\n\nSee also\nList of state parties of the Democratic Party (United States)\nList of state parties of the Libertarian Party (United States)\nList of state parties of the Republican Party (United States)\nPassage 7:\nBowling Green Plateau\nBowling Green Plateau (79\u00b042\u2032S 158\u00b036\u2032E) is a small but prominent ice-covered plateau at the north side of the Brown Hills in the Cook Mountains in Antarctica  It was named by the Victoria University of Wellington Antarctic Expedition (VUWAE) (1962\u201363); Professor Charles C.

It was written by Melissa Rosenberg, based on the 2008 novel Breaking Dawn by Stephenie Meyer. The sequel to The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 1 (2011), it is the fifth installment in The Twilight Saga film series. The film stars Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner, reprising their roles as Bella Swan, Edward Cullen, and Jacob Black, respectively; Mackenzie Foy portrays Renesmee Cullen. The ensemble cast includes Billy Burke, Peter Facinelli, Elizabeth Reaser, Kellan Lutz, Nikki Reed, Jackson Rathbone, Ashley Greene, Michael Sheen, and Dakota Fanning.\nSummit Entertainment announced that Breaking Dawn would be adapted into a two-part film on June 10, 2010. Principal photography for both parts began on November 1, 2010, and wrapped on April 22, 2011. The second part was shot in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana; and Vancouver, Canada.\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2 premiered in Los Angeles on November 12, 2012, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 16, by Summit Entertainment. The film grossed $829.7 million worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2012, the highest-grossing film of The Twilight Saga series, and the highest-grossing film released by Summit Entertainment, despite mixed reviews.\n\nPlot\nThe movie continues from the events of the previous film, as Bella, who has just given birth, awakens from her human-to-vampire transformation. After Edward helps her satisfy her initial thirst, Bella is introduced to her daughter Renesmee. The rest of the Cullens and Jacob stay nearby, and when Jacob acts possessively towards Renesmee, Bella learns he has imprinted on her, making her furious until he explains he has no ill intentions.\nMeanwhile, Bella's father, Charlie, has been trying to contact the Cullens for updates on Bella's health. Carlisle announces that they have to leave Forks, Washington, to protect their identities - especially because of Charlie. Jacob, desperate not to lose Renesmee, visits Charlie and tells him that Bella is alive and well, but that she had to change in order to get better. Jacob also tells him he doesn't live in the world he thinks he does, and then reveals his wolf form to him. Charlie goes to the Cullen house to see Bella and meet Renesmee. He accepts that Bella is now recovered and this is her chosen life, but he does not know what has changed her or where Renesmee came from, aside from she's 'adopted'.\nSeveral months pass with Carlisle monitoring Renesmee's rapid growth. On an outing in the woods, a bitter Irina sees Renesmee from a distance and assumes she's an immortal child. Immortal children were vampires who were changed in childhood, and because they could not be trained nor restrained, they slaughtered entire villages. The creation of such children is outlawed by the Volturi and anyone caught with one is to be executed.\nIrina goes to the Volturi, reporting what she has seen. Alice gets a vision of the Volturi and Irina coming to kill the Cullens and instructs the others to gather as many witnesses as they can to testify that Renesmee is not an immortal child. Alice and Jasper then leave to gather evidence of this. The Cullens begin to summon witnesses, such as the Denali family. One of the Denalis, Eleazar, later discovers that Bella has a special ability: a powerful mental shield that had protected her from Edward's mind-reading even when she was human, which she is taught to extend to protect others from vampire powers.\nThe Volturi, led by Aro, arrive in Forks prepared for battle. Seeing the large group of vampires (the Cullens and their witnesses) and wolves, they stop their procession. They are able to prove to Aro that Renesmee is not an immortal child; however, the Volturi are eager to add the gifted members of the Cullen coven to the guard, so they execute Irina in an attempt to provoke a battle. Before a fight breaks out, Alice and Jasper return and Alice shows Aro her visions of the future.\nIn this violent vision, she and Jasper are arrested for attacking Aro after Alice finds out he will not change his decision and kicks him in the face. Carlisle tries to save them but is murdered by Aro. Jasper is beheaded by Demetri and Jane. Alice and Sam together avenge Jasper by killing Jane. Caius is partially beheaded by Tanya (a member of the Denalis) as revenge for Irina's execution. Seth is killed by Felix. Leah saves Esme's life but loses hers in the process. Marcus welcomes his death as he is torn to pieces by Vladimir and Stefan. Aro tries to kill Edward but a joint effort from Bella and Edward kills him. The vision ends with Bella burning Aro's detached head as other Volturi members try to grab her from behind.\nAro, despite being afraid of the vision future, still wants to execute Renesmee as she might become savage. Alice and Jasper reveal their final witness, Nahuel, a half-human half-vampire just like Renesmee. He proves that he is not a threat, supporting the notion that Renesmee is not one either. The Volturi unhappily leave, Aro fearfully explaining that there will be no battle today.\nBack at the Cullen home, Alice glimpses the future, seeing Edward and Bella greeting Jacob and a fully matured Renesmee, also a couple, on a sun-dappled beach. Edward reads Alice's mind and feels relieved that Renesmee has Jacob to protect her. Alone in the meadow, Bella pushes her mental shield away and finally allows Edward to see into her mind, showing him every moment they have shared together. They kiss after Bella tells him, \"nobody has ever loved anybody as much as I love you\", and he says \"with one exception.\"\n\nCast\nGil Birmingham, Sarah Clarke, Michael Welch, Anna Kendrick, Christian Serratos, Justin Chon, Cam Gigandet, Edi Gathegi, Rachelle Lefevre, Kiowa Gordon, Tyson Houseman, Alex Meraz, Bronson Pelletier, Graham Greene, Tinsel Korey, Alex Rice, Xavier Samuel, Jodelle Ferland, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Carolina Virguez from the previous films make archival cameo appearances during the pre-credits montage accompanied by a duet version of Christina Perri\u2019s \u201cA Thousand Years\u201d with Steve Kazee as the second voice.\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\nOn June 10, 2010, Summit Entertainment announced that a two-part adaptation of the novel Breaking Dawn would start filming in November and made clear that all major actors would return for both parts.\n\nPre-production\nBy August 2010, screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg said that the scripts for Part 1 and 2 were 75 to 85 percent completed. She found the greatest challenge in writing the scripts to be the final sequence of Part 2, explaining, \"The final battle sequence is a big challenge because it lasts 25 pages. It's almost an entire three-act story in and of itself. You have to track [keep it all in one setting] hundreds of characters. It's an enormous challenge to choreograph on the page and for Bill [Condon] to choreograph on the stage.\" She had written various drafts of the scene but, at the time, hadn't revised or discussed them with Condon yet. She said, \"That's the next big hurdle to sit down with the stunt coordinator and create the ballet. It's a lot of work. I'm exhausted, but we're intent on making them the best scripts yet.\" Producer Wyck Godfrey called Part 2 \"an action film in terms of life-and-death stakes\" and said that in Part 1 \"there are the pangs of newlywed tension that occur that are relatable even in a fantasy film. Marriage is not quite the experience that they thought it was.\"Godfrey considered releasing the second film in 3D to differentiate between the time before and after Bella becomes a vampire, an idea originally proposed for The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, but said that the decision was up to Condon. However, he said that if the second film were to be released in 3D, he would like to shoot it with the proper equipment in \"real\" 3D as was done with Avatar (2009), not convert it into 3D in post-production as was done with Clash of the Titans (2010).\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography started on November 1, 2010, and wrapped on April 22, 2011, ending the franchise's three years of production since March 2008. Filming was shot on location in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana; and Vancouver, Canada. Filming also occurred at Raleigh Studios in Baton Rouge.On the subject of the final day and her final moment as Bella, Stewart stated, \"After that scene, my true final scene, I felt like I could shoot up into the night sky and every pore of my body would shoot light. I felt lighter than I've ever felt in my life.\"In April 2012, the crew and some of the cast, including Pattinson and Stewart, returned for reshoots to pick up some additional shots for technical work. These re-shoots did not include any new scenes or dialogue.\n\nSpecial effects\nTippett Studio first began working on the CGI (computer-generated imagery) wolves in February 2009 for The Twilight Saga: New Moon, and the look of the creatures has evolved, becoming more photo-real over the course of the saga, with the input of three different directors. \"It's a subtle balance of just how anthropomorphic these wolves are,\" says Eric Leven. \"Bill (Condon) wanted to make sure that we had a sense of the human or the shapeshifter in there. Finding that balance of how much of a human performance versus an animal performance was important for Bill.\"\nLeven adds, \"Bill has always treated the wolves as characters and never as computer-generated things, and directs them in the same way he'd direct any actor. He would always give us direction like Sam should be angrier. It's the best way to work. His treating these creatures as characters, instead of just computer bits, was really great.\"\n\"Because we've been working on this franchise for such a prolonged period of time, we've been able to improve the look from show to show,\" comments Phil Tippett. \"Wolves generally are pretty darn clean and since Bill wanted the wolves rangier, that means a lot more fur matting and clumping, like they've lived out in the woods. We edged towards something a bit more feral.\"\n\"However, there is also a balance between look and technology,\" adds Tippett. \"The body count of the wolves escalates and because we're adding a great deal more hair to get the right texture, that fur really ups the rendering time. We've gone from four wolves to eight to twelve, to sixteen in Part 2. So we have to be very careful about that balance because it takes hundreds of hours to render each wolf.\"\n\nMusic\nIt was revealed in January 2012 that the soundtrack for Part 2 had already started production. Confirmed for the soundtrack in advance were \"Heart of Stone\" by Iko, which plays when Edward and Bella are talking in the cottage after finding Alice's note and \"Where I Come From\" by Passion Pit, which will play when Bella wakes up from her transformation. The lead single from the soundtrack is \"The Forgotten\", performed by the American rock band Green Day. \"A Thousand Years, Pt. 2\" by the American singer Christina Perri is also featured on the soundtrack album.\nCarter Burwell, the composer of Twilight and Breaking Dawn: Part 1, returned to score the final installment of the series.\n\nRelease\nBox office\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2 earned $292 million in North America and $537 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $829.6 million.

The consensus states: \"It's the most entertaining Twilight, but that's not enough to make Breaking Dawn Part 2 worth watching for filmgoers who don't already count themselves among the franchise converts.\" At Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100 based on reviews from 31 critics. Audiences polled on CinemaScore gave it an average rating of \"A\".Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"The final installment of the immortal Bella/Edward romance will give its breathlessly awaiting international audience just what it wants\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said, \"Breaking Dawn: Part 2 starts off slow but gathers momentum, and that's because, with Bella and Edward united against the Volturi, the picture has a real threat\". Sara Stewart of the New York Post wrote, \"Finally, someone took the source material at its terribly written word and stopped treating the whole affair so seriously\". Justin Chang of Variety praised the performance of Stewart by saying, \"No longer a mopey, lower-lip-biting emo girl, this Bella is twitchy, feral, formidable and fully energized, a goddess even among her exalted bloodsucker brethren\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, \"Despite the slow start Mr. Condon closes the series in fine, smooth style. He gives fans all the lovely flowers, conditioned hair and lightly erotic, dreamy kisses they deserve\".Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, saying \"its audience, which takes these films very seriously indeed, will drink deeply of its blood. The sensational closing sequence cannot be accused of leaving a single loophole, not even some of those we didn't know were there\". He concluded by saying, \"\"Breaking Dawn, Part 2\" must be one of the more serious entries in any major movie franchise... it bit the bullet, and I imagine fans will be pleased.\" Helen O'Hara of Empire gave the film a mixed review and said, \"Fans will be left on a high; other viewers will be confused but generally entertained by a saga whose romance is matched only by its weirdness\".\n\nHome media\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2 was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 2, 2013. As of June 1, 2014, Breaking Dawn: Part 2 has sold 4,810,249 DVDs along with 1,224,869 Blu-ray Discs for $71,418,469 and $24,472,107, respectively, totaling $99,195,325.\n\nSpin-offs\nIn September 2016, Lionsgate co-chairman Patrick Wachsberger stated that a sequel was \"a possibility\", but would only go ahead if Stephenie Meyer wanted to do one.

    "Passage 1:\nBlack Death\nThe Black Death (also known as the Pestilence, the Great Mortality or the Plague) was a bubonic plague pandemic occurring in Western Eurasia and North Africa from 1346 to 1353. It is the most fatal pandemic recorded in human history, causing the deaths of 75\u2013200 million people, peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351. Bubonic plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis spread by fleas, but during the Black Death it probably also took a secondary form, spread by person-to-person contact via aerosols, causing pneumonic plague.The Black Death was the beginning of the second plague pandemic. The plague created religious, social and economic upheavals, with profound effects on the course of European history.\nThe origin of the Black Death is disputed. Genetic analysis points to the evolution of Yersinia pestis in the Tian Shan mountains on the border between Kyrgyzstan and China 2,600 years ago. The immediate territorial origins of the Black Death and its outbreak remains unclear with some pointing towards Central Asia, China, the Middle East and Europe. The pandemic was reportedly first introduced to Europe during the siege of the Genoese trading port of Kaffa in Crimea by the Golden Horde army of Jani Beg in 1347. From Crimea, it was most likely carried by fleas living on the black rats that travelled on Genoese ships, spreading through the Mediterranean Basin and reaching North Africa, Western Asia and the rest of Europe via Constantinople, Sicily and the Italian Peninsula. There is evidence that once it came ashore, the Black Death mainly spread person-to-person as pneumonic plague, thus explaining the quick inland spread of the epidemic, which was faster than would be expected if the primary vector was rat fleas causing bubonic plague. In 2022, it was discovered that there was a sudden surge of deaths in what is today Kyrgyzstan from the Black Death in the late 1330s; when combined with genetic evidence, this implies that the initial spread may not have been due to Mongol conquests in the 14th century, as previously speculated.The Black Death was the second great natural disaster to strike Europe during the Late Middle Ages (the first one being the Great Famine of 1315\u20131317) and is estimated to have killed 30 percent to 60 percent of the European population, as well as about one-third of the population of the Middle East. The plague might have reduced the world population from c.\u2009475 million to 350\u2013375 million in the 14th century. There were further outbreaks throughout the Late Middle Ages and, with other contributing factors (the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages), the European population did not regain its level in 1300 until 1500. Outbreaks of the plague recurred around the world until the early 19th century.\n\nNames\nEuropean writers contemporary with the plague described the disease in Latin as pestis or pestilentia, 'pestilence'; epidemia, 'epidemic'; mortalitas, 'mortality'. In English prior to the 18th century, the event was called the \"pestilence\" or \"great pestilence\", \"the plague\" or the \"great death\". Subsequent to the pandemic \"the furste moreyn\" (first murrain) or \"first pestilence\" was applied, to distinguish the mid-14th century phenomenon from other infectious diseases and epidemics of plague.The 1347 pandemic plague was not referred to specifically as \"black\" in the time of occurrence in any European language, though the expression \"black death\" had occasionally been applied to fatal disease beforehand. \"Black death\" was not used to describe the plague pandemic in English until the 1750s; the term is first attested in 1755, where it translated Danish: den sorte d\u00f8d, lit.\u2009'the black death'. This expression as a proper name for the pandemic had been popularized by Swedish and Danish chroniclers in the 15th and early 16th centuries, and in the 16th and 17th centuries was transferred to other languages as a calque: Icelandic: svarti dau\u00f0i, German: der schwarze Tod, and French: la mort noire. Previously, most European languages had named the pandemic a variant or calque of the Latin: magna mortalitas, lit.\u2009'Great Death'.The phrase 'black death' \u2013 describing Death as black \u2013 is very old. Homer used it in the Odyssey to describe the monstrous Scylla, with her mouths \"full of black Death\" (Ancient Greek: \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u0398\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf, romanized: ple\u00eeoi m\u00e9lanos Than\u00e1toio). Seneca the Younger may have been the first to describe an epidemic as 'black death', (Latin: mors atra) but only in reference to the acute lethality and dark prognosis of disease. The 12th\u201313th century French physician Gilles de Corbeil had already used atra mors to refer to a \"pestilential fever\" (febris pestilentialis) in his work On the Signs and Symptoms of Diseases (De signis et symptomatibus aegritudium). The phrase mors nigra, 'black death', was used in 1350 by Simon de Covino (or Couvin), a Belgian astronomer, in his poem \"On the Judgement of the Sun at a Feast of Saturn\" (De judicio Solis in convivio Saturni), which attributes the plague to an astrological conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn. His use of the phrase is not connected unambiguously with the plague pandemic of 1347 and appears to refer to the fatal outcome of disease.The historian Cardinal Francis Aidan Gasquet wrote about the Great Pestilence in 1893 and suggested that it had been \"some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague\". In 1908, Gasquet said use of the name atra mors for the 14th-century epidemic first appeared in a 1631 book on Danish history by J. I. Pontanus: \"Commonly and from its effects, they called it the black death\" (Vulgo & ab effectu atram mortem vocitabant).\n\nPrevious plague epidemics\nResearch from 2017 suggests plague first infected humans in Europe and Asia in the Late Neolithic-Early Bronze Age. Research in 2018 found evidence of Yersinia pestis in an ancient Swedish tomb, which may have been associated with the \"Neolithic decline\" around 3000 BCE, in which European populations fell significantly. This Y. pestis may have been different from more modern types, with bubonic plague transmissible by fleas first known from Bronze Age remains near Samara.The symptoms of bubonic plague are first attested in a fragment of Rufus of Ephesus preserved by Oribasius; these ancient medical authorities suggest bubonic plague had appeared in the Roman Empire before the reign of Trajan, six centuries before arriving at Pelusium in the reign of Justinian I. In 2013, researchers confirmed earlier speculation that the cause of the Plague of Justinian (541\u2013542 CE, with recurrences until 750) was Y. pestis. This is known as the first plague pandemic. In 610, the Chinese physician Chao Yuanfang described a \"malignant bubo\" \"coming in abruptly with high fever together with the appearance of a bundle of nodes beneath the tissue.\" The Chinese physician Sun Simo who died in 652 also mentioned a \"malignant bubo\" and plague that was common in Lingnan (Guangzhou). Ole J\u00f8rgen Benedictow believes that this indicates it was an offshoot of the first plague pandemic which made its way eastward to Chinese territory by around 600.\n\n14th-century plague\nCauses\nEarly theory\nThe most authoritative contemporary account is found in a report from the medical faculty in Paris to Philip VI of France. It blamed the heavens, in the form of a conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a \"great pestilence in the air\" (miasma theory). Muslim religious scholars taught that the pandemic was a \"martyrdom and mercy\" from God, assuring the believer's place in paradise. For non-believers, it was a punishment. Some Muslim doctors cautioned against trying to prevent or treat a disease sent by God. Others adopted preventive measures and treatments for plague used by Europeans. These Muslim doctors also depended on the writings of the ancient Greeks.\n\nPredominant modern theory\nDue to climate change in Asia, rodents began to flee the dried-out grasslands to more populated areas, spreading the disease. The plague disease, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas, including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, North India, Uganda and the western United States.Y. pestis was discovered by Alexandre Yersin, a pupil of Louis Pasteur, during an epidemic of bubonic plague in Hong Kong in 1894; Yersin also proved this bacillus was present in rodents and suggested the rat was the main vehicle of transmission. The mechanism by which Y. pestis is usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage starves the fleas and drives them to aggressive feeding behaviour and attempts to clear the blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lacks resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic.\n\nDNA evidence\nDefinitive confirmation of the role of Y. pestis arrived in 2010 with a publication in PLOS Pathogens by Haensch et al. They assessed the presence of DNA/RNA with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques for Y. pestis from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences. The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany, \"ends the debate about the cause of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that Y. pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages\". In 2011, these results were further confirmed with genetic evidence derived from Black Death victims in the East Smithfield burial site in England. Schuenemann et al. concluded in 2011 \"that the Black Death in medieval Europe was caused by a variant of Y. pestis that may no longer exist\".Later in 2011, Bos et al. reported in Nature the first draft genome of Y. pestis from plague victims from the same East Smithfield cemetery and indicated that the strain that caused the Black Death is ancestral to most modern strains of Y. pestis.Since this time, further genomic papers have further confirmed the phylogenetic placement of the Y. pestis strain responsible for the Black Death as both the ancestor of later plague epidemics including the third plague pandemic and as the descendant of the strain responsible for the Plague of Justinian. In addition, plague genomes from significantly earlier in prehistory have been recovered.DNA taken from 25 skeletons from 14th century London have shown plague is a strain of Y. pestis almost identical to that which hit Madagascar in 2013. Further DNA evidence also proves the role of Y. Pestis and traces the source to the Tian Shan Mountains in Kyrgyzstan.\n\nAlternative explanations\nIt is recognised that an epidemiological account of plague is as important as an identification of symptoms, but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period. Most work has been done on the spread of the disease in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken in England between the time of publication of the Domesday Book of 1086 and the poll tax of the year 1377. Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures for the clergy.\nMathematical modelling is used to match the spreading patterns and the means of transmission. A research in 2018 challenged the popular hypothesis that \"infected rats died, their flea parasites could have jumped from the recently dead rat hosts to humans\". It suggested an alternative model in which \"the disease was spread from human fleas and body lice to other people\". The second model claims to better fit the trends of death toll because the rat-flea-human hypothesis would have produced a delayed but very high spike in deaths, which contradict historical death data.Lars Wall\u00f8e complains that all of these authors \"take it for granted that Simond's infection model, black rat \u2192 rat flea \u2192 human, which was developed to explain the spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of Yersinia pestis infection could spread\", whilst pointing to several other possibilities. Similarly, Monica Green has argued that greater attention is needed to the range of (especially non-commensal) animals that might be involved in the transmission of plague.Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of numerous rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the disease spread too quickly to support the thesis that Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. This theory is supported by research in 2018 which suggested transmission was more likely by body lice and fleas during the second plague pandemic.\n\nSummary\nAlthough academic debate continues, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicaemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed in the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis. Currently, while osteoarcheologists have conclusively verified the presence of Y. pestis bacteria in burial sites across northern Europe through examination of bones and dental pulp, no other epidemic pathogen has been discovered to bolster the alternative explanations.\n\nTransmission\nLack of hygiene\nThe importance of hygiene was recognised only in the nineteenth century with the development of the germ theory of disease; until then streets were commonly filthy, with live animals of all sorts around and human parasites abounding, facilitating the spread of transmissible disease.By the early fourteenth century so much filth had collected inside urban Europe that French and Italian cities were naming streets after human waste. In medieval Paris, several street names were inspired by merde, the French word for \"shit\". There were rue Merdeux, rue Merdelet, rue Merdusson, rue des Merdons and rue Merdiere\u2014as well as a rue du Pipi.Pigs, cattle, chickens, geese, goats and horses roamed the streets of medieval London and Paris. Medieval homeowners were supposed to police their housefronts, including removing animal dung, but most urbanites were as careless as William E. Cosner, a resident of the London suburb of Farringdon Without. A complaint lodged against Cosner charges that \"men could not pass [by his house] for the stink [of] . . . horse dung and horse piss.\"One irate Londoner complained that the runoff from the local slaughterhouse had made his garden \"stinking and putrid\", while another charged that the blood from slain animals flooded nearby streets and lanes, \"making a foul corruption and abominable sight to all dwelling near.\" In much of medieval Europe, sanitation legislation consisted of an ordinance requiring homeowners to shout, \"Look out below!\" three times before dumping a full chamber pot into the street.Early Christians, who thought self-abnegation a cardinal virtue, considered bathing, if not a vice, then a temptation. \"Who knows what impure thoughts might arise in a tub of warm water? With this danger in mind, St. Benedict declared, \"To those who are well, and especially to the young, bathing shall seldom be permitted.\" St. Agnes took the injunction to heart and died without ever bathing.\n\nTerritorial origins\nAccording to a team of medical geneticists led by Mark Achtman that analysed the genetic variation of the bacterium Yersinia pestis \"evolved in or near China\" over 2,600 years ago. Later research by a team led by Galina Eroshenko places the origins more specifically in the Tian Shan mountains on the border between Kyrgyzstan and China. However more recent research notes that the previous sampling had a very heavy East Asian bias and that sampling since then has discovered strains of Y. pestis in the Caucasus region that were previously thought to be restricted to China. There is also no physical or specific textual evidence of the Black Death in 14th century China. As a result, China's place in the sequence of the plague's spread is still debated to this day. According to Charles Creighton, records of epidemics in 14th century China suggest nothing more than typhus and major Chinese outbreaks of epidemic disease post-date the European epidemic by several years. The earliest Chinese descriptions of the bubonic plague do not appear until the 1640s.Nestorian graves dating to 1338\u20131339 near Issyk-Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague, which has led some historians and epidemiologists to think they mark the outbreak of the epidemic; this is supported by recent direct findings of Y. pestis DNA in teeth samples from graves in the area with inscriptions referring to \"pestilence\" as the cause of death. Epidemics killed an estimated 25 million across Asia during the fifteen years before the Black Death reached Constantinople in 1347.\nThe evidence does not suggest, at least at present, that these mortality crises were caused by plague. Although some scholars, including McNeill and Cao, see the 1333 outbreak as a prelude to the outbreaks in Europe from the late 1340s to the early 1350s, scholars of the Yuan and Ming periods remain skeptical about such an interpretation. Nonetheless, the remarkably high mortality rates during the Datong mortality should discourage us from rejecting the possibility of localized/regional outbreaks of plague in different parts of China, albeit differing in scale from, and unrelated to, the pandemic mortality of the Black Death. What we lack is any indication of a plague pandemic that engulfed vast territories of the Yuan Empire and later moved into western Eurasia through Central Asia.\nAccording to John Norris, evidence from Issyk-Kul indicates a small sporadic outbreak characteristic of transmission from rodents to humans with no wide-scale impact. According to Achtman, the dating of the plague suggests that it was not carried along the Silk Road, and its widespread appearance in that region probably postdates the European outbreak. There are no records of the symptoms of the Black Death from Mongol sources or writings from travelers east of the Black Sea prior to the Crimean outbreak in 1346. Finally, the Silk Road had already been heavily disrupted before the spread of the Black Death. Western and Middle Eastern traders found it difficult to trade on the Silk Road by 1325 and impossible by 1340, making spread of the plague less likely.Others still favor an origin in China or even Kurdistan, and not Central Asia. According to the theory of Chinese origin, the disease may have traveled along the Silk Road with Mongol armies and traders, or it could have arrived via ship, but this theory is still contested. It is speculated that rats aboard Zheng He's ships in the 15th century may have carried the plague to Southeast Asia, India and Africa.\nResearch on the Delhi Sultanate and the Yuan Dynasty shows no evidence of any serious epidemic in fourteenth-century India and no specific evidence of plague in fourteenth-century China, suggesting that the Black Death may not have reached these regions. Ole Benedictow argues that since the first clear reports of the Black Death come from Kaffa, the Black Death most likely originated in the nearby plague focus on the northwestern shore of the Caspian Sea.\nDemographic historians estimate that China's population fell by at least 15 percent, and perhaps as much as a third, between 1340 and 1370. This population loss coincided with the Black Death that ravaged Europe and much of the Islamic world in 1347\u201352. However, there is a conspicuous lack of evidence for pandemic disease on the scale of the Black Death in China at this time. War and famine \u2013 and the diseases that typically accompanied them \u2013 probably were the main causes of mortality in the final decades of Mongol rule.\nMonica H. Green suggests that the reason why other parts of Eurasia outside the west do not contain the same evidence of the Black Plague is because there were actually four strains of Yersinia pestis that became predominant in different parts of the world. Mongol records of illness such as food poisoning may have been referring to the Black Plague. Another theory is that the Black Death originated near Europe and cycled through the Mediterranean, Northern Europe and Russia before making its way to China. Other historians such as John Norris and Ole Benedictaw believe the Black Death likely originated in Europe or the Middle East and never reached China.\n\nEuropean outbreak\nPlague was reportedly first introduced to Europe via Genoese traders from their port city of Kaffa in the Crimea in 1347. During a protracted siege of the city, in 1345\u20131346 the Mongol Golden Horde army of Jani Beg, whose mainly Tatar troops were suffering from the disease, catapulted infected corpses over the city walls of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants, though it is more likely that infected rats travelled across the siege lines to spread the epidemic to the inhabitants. As the disease took hold, Genoese traders fled across the Black Sea to Constantinople, where the disease first arrived in Europe in summer 1347.The epidemic there killed the 13-year-old son of the Byzantine emperor, John VI Kantakouzenos, who wrote a description of the disease modelled on Thucydides's account of the 5th century BCE Plague of Athens, but noting the spread of the Black Death by ship between maritime cities. Nicephorus Gregoras also described in writing to Demetrios Kydones the rising death toll, the futility of medicine, and the panic of the citizens. The first outbreak in Constantinople lasted a year, but the disease recurred ten times before 1400.Carried by twelve Genoese galleys, plague arrived by ship in Sicily in October 1347; the disease spread rapidly all over the island. Galleys from Kaffa reached Genoa and Venice in January 1348, but it was the outbreak in Pisa a few weeks later that was the entry point to northern Italy. Towards the end of January, one of the galleys expelled from Italy arrived in Marseilles.From Italy, the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France, Spain (the epidemic began to wreak havoc first on the Crown of Aragon in the spring of 1348), Portugal and England by June 1348, then spread east and north through Germany, Scotland and Scandinavia from 1348 to 1350. It was introduced into Norway in 1349 when a ship landed at Ask\u00f8y, then spread to Bj\u00f8rgvin (modern Bergen) and Iceland. Finally, it spread to northwestern Russia in 1351. Plague was somewhat more uncommon in parts of Europe with less developed trade with their neighbours, including the majority of the Basque Country, isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands, and isolated Alpine villages throughout the continent.According to some epidemiologists, periods of unfavourable weather decimated plague-infected rodent populations and forced their fleas onto alternative hosts, inducing plague outbreaks which often peaked in the hot summers of the Mediterranean, as well as during the cool autumn months of the southern Baltic region. Among many other culprits of plague contagiousness, malnutrition, even if distantly, also contributed to such an immense loss in European population, since it weakened immune systems.\n\nWestern Asian and North African outbreak\nThe disease struck various regions in the Middle East and North Africa during the pandemic, leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures. As infected rodents infected new rodents, the disease spread across the region, entering also from southern Russia.\nBy autumn 1347, plague had reached Alexandria in Egypt, transmitted by sea from Constantinople; according to a contemporary witness, from a single merchant ship carrying slaves. By late summer 1348 it reached Cairo, capital of the Mamluk Sultanate, cultural centre of the Islamic world, and the largest city in the Mediterranean Basin; the Bahriyya child sultan an-Nasir Hasan fled and more than a third of the 600,000 residents died. The Nile was choked with corpses despite Cairo having a medieval hospital, the late 13th century bimaristan of the Qalawun complex. The historian al-Maqrizi described the abundant work for grave-diggers and practitioners of funeral rites, and plague recurred in Cairo more than fifty times over the following one and a half centuries.During 1347, the disease travelled eastward to Gaza by April; by July it had reached Damascus, and in October plague had broken out in Aleppo. That year, in the territory of modern Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Palestine, the cities of Ascalon, Acre, Jerusalem, Sidon and Homs were all infected. In 1348\u20131349, the disease reached Antioch. The city's residents fled to the north, but most of them ended up dying during the journey. Within two years, the plague had spread throughout the Islamic world, from Arabia across North Africa. The pandemic spread westwards from Alexandria along the African coast, while in April 1348 Tunis was infected by ship from Sicily. Tunis was then under attack by an army from Morocco; this army dispersed in 1348 and brought the contagion with them to Morocco, whose epidemic may also have been seeded from the Islamic city of Almer\u00eda in al-Andalus.Mecca became infected in 1348 by pilgrims performing the Hajj. In 1351 or 1352, the Rasulid sultan of the Yemen, al-Mujahid Ali, was released from Mamluk captivity in Egypt and carried plague with him on his return home. During 1348, records show the city of Mosul suffered a massive epidemic, and the city of Baghdad experienced a second round of the disease.\n\nSigns and symptoms\nBubonic plague\nSymptoms of the disease include fever of 38\u201341 \u00b0C (100\u2013106 \u00b0F), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 percent die within eight days.Contemporary accounts of the pandemic are varied and often imprecise. The most commonly noted symptom was the appearance of buboes (or gavocciolos) in the groin, neck and armpits, which oozed pus and bled when opened. Boccaccio's description:\n\nIn men and women alike it first betrayed itself by the emergence of certain tumours in the groin or armpits, some of which grew as large as a common apple, others as an egg ... From the two said parts of the body this deadly gavocciolo soon began to propagate and spread itself in all directions indifferently; after which the form of the malady began to change, black spots or livid making their appearance in many cases on the arm or the thigh or elsewhere, now few and large, now minute and numerous. As the gavocciolo had been and still was an infallible token of approaching death, such also were these spots on whomsoever they showed themselves.\nThis was followed by acute fever and vomiting of blood. Most people died two to seven days after initial infection. Freckle-like spots and rashes, which could have been caused by flea-bites, were identified as another potential sign of plague.\n\nPneumonic plague\nLodewijk Heyligen, whose master the Cardinal Colonna died of plague in 1348, noted a distinct form of the disease, pneumonic plague, that infected the lungs and led to respiratory problems. Symptoms include fever, cough and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free-flowing and bright red. Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent.\n\nSepticaemic plague\nSepticaemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicaemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.\n\nConsequences\nDeaths\nThere are no exact figures for the death toll; the rate varied widely by locality. In urban centres, the greater the population before the outbreak, the longer the duration of the period of abnormal mortality. It killed some 75 to 200 million people in Eurasia. A study published in 2022 of pollen samples across Europe between 1250 and 1450 was used to estimate changes in agricultural output before and after the Black Death. The authors found great variability in different regions, with evidence for high mortality in areas of Scandinavia, France, western Germany, Greece and central Italy, but uninterrupted agricultural growth in central and eastern Europe, Iberia and Ireland.The mortality rate of the Black Death in the 14th century was far greater than the worst 20th-century outbreaks of Y. pestis plague, which occurred in India and killed as much as 3% of the population of certain cities. The overwhelming number of deceased bodies produced by the Black Death caused the necessity of mass burial sites in Europe, sometimes including up to several hundred or several thousand skeletons. The mass burial sites that have been excavated have allowed archaeologists to continue interpreting and defining the biological, sociological, historical and anthropological implications of the Black Death.According to medieval historian Philip Daileader, it is likely that over four years, 45\u201350% of the European population died of plague. Norwegian historian Ole Benedictow suggests it could have been as much as 60% of the European population. In 1348, the disease spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. Half of Paris' population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from between 110,000 and 120,000 inhabitants in 1338 down to 50,000 in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well, with a death toll of approximately 62,000 between 1346 and 1353. Florence's tax records suggest that 80% of the city's population died within four months in 1348. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. The disease bypassed some areas, with the most isolated areas being less vulnerable to contagion. Plague did not appear in Douai in Flanders until the turn of the 15th century, and the impact was less severe on the populations of Hainaut, Finland, northern Germany and areas of Poland. Monks, nuns and priests were especially hard-hit since they cared for people with the Black Death.\n\nThe physician to the Avignon Papacy, Raimundo Chalmel de Vinario (Latin: Magister Raimundus, lit.\u2009'Master Raymond'), observed the decreasing mortality rate of successive outbreaks of plague in 1347\u201348, 1362, 1371 and 1382 in his 1382 treatise On Epidemics (De epidemica). In the first outbreak, two thirds of the population contracted the illness and most patients died; in the next, half the population became ill but only some died; by the third, a tenth were affected and many survived; while by the fourth occurrence, only one in twenty people were sickened and most of them survived. By the 1380s in Europe, it predominantly affected children. Chalmel de Vinario recognised that bloodletting was ineffective (though he continued to prescribe bleeding for members of the Roman Curia, whom he disliked), and said that all true cases of plague were caused by astrological factors and were incurable; he himself was never able to effect a cure.The most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran and Syria, during this time, is for a death toll of about a third of the population. The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypt's population. In Cairo, with a population numbering as many as 600,000, and possibly the largest city west of China, between one third and 40% of the inhabitants died within eight months.Italian chronicler Agnolo di Tura recorded his experience from Siena, where plague arrived in May 1348:\n\nFather abandoned child, wife husband, one brother another; for this illness seemed to strike through the breath and sight. And so they died. And none could be found to bury the dead for money or friendship. Members of a household brought their dead to a ditch as best they could, without priest, without divine offices ... great pits were dug and piled deep with the multitude of dead. And they died by the hundreds both day and night ... And as soon as those ditches were filled more were dug ... And I, Agnolo di Tura ... buried my five children with my own hands. And there were also those who were so sparsely covered with earth that the dogs dragged them forth and devoured many bodies throughout the city. There was no one who wept for any death, for all awaited death. And so many died that all believed it was the end of the world.\n\nEconomic\nIt has been suggested that the plague, like some others in history, disproportionately affected the poorest people, who were already in generally worse physical condition than the wealthier citizens.  Nevertheless, with such a large overall population decline from the pandemic, wages soared in response to a labour shortage. On the other hand, in the quarter century after the Black Death in England, it is clear many labourers, artisans and craftsmen, those living from money-wages alone, did suffer a reduction in real incomes owing to rampant inflation. Landowners were also pushed to substitute monetary rents for labour services in an effort to keep tenants.\n\nEnvironmental\nA study performed by Thomas Van Hoof of the Utrecht University suggests that the innumerable deaths brought on by the pandemic cooled the climate by freeing up land and triggering reforestation. This may have led to the Little Ice Age.\n\nPersecutions\nRenewed religious fervour and fanaticism bloomed in the wake of the Black Death. Some Europeans targeted \"various groups such as Jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims\", lepers and Romani, blaming them for the crisis. Lepers, and others with skin diseases such as acne or psoriasis, were killed throughout Europe.\nBecause 14th-century healers and governments were at a loss to explain or stop the disease, Europeans turned to astrological forces, earthquakes and the poisoning of wells by Jews as possible reasons for outbreaks. Many believed the epidemic was a punishment by God for their sins, and could be relieved by winning God's forgiveness.There were many attacks against Jewish communities. In the Strasbourg massacre of February 1349, about 2,000 Jews were murdered. In August 1349, the Jewish communities in Mainz and Cologne were annihilated. By 1351, 60 major and 150 smaller Jewish communities had been destroyed. During this period many Jews relocated to Poland, where they received a warm welcome from King Casimir the Great.\n\nSocial\nOne theory that has been advanced is that the devastation in Florence caused by the Black Death, which hit Europe between 1348 and 1350, resulted in a shift in the world view of people in 14th-century Italy and led to the Renaissance. Italy was particularly badly hit by the pandemic, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on Earth, rather than on spirituality and the afterlife. It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the sponsorship of religious works of art.This does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred in Italy in the 14th century. The Black Death was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors, in combination with an influx of Greek scholars following the fall of the Byzantine Empire. As a result of the drastic reduction in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom. To answer the increased need for labour, workers travelled in search of the most favorable position economically.Prior to the emergence of the Black Death, the workings of Europe were run by the Catholic Church and the continent was considered a feudalistic society, composed of fiefs and city-states. The pandemic completely restructured both religion and political forces; survivors began to turn to other forms of spirituality and the power dynamics of the fiefs and city-states crumbled.Cairo's population, partly owing to the numerous plague epidemics, was in the early 18th century half of what it was in 1347. The populations of some Italian cities, notably Florence, did not regain their pre-14th century size until the 19th century. The demographic decline due to the pandemic had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30\u201340% in most parts of Europe between 1350 and 1400. Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. The survivors of the pandemic found not only that the prices of food were lower but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives, and this probably destabilised feudalism.The word \"quarantine\" has its roots in this period, though the concept of isolating people to prevent the spread of disease is older. In the city-state of Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik, Croatia), a thirty-day isolation period was implemented in 1377 for new arrivals to the city from plague-affected areas. The isolation period was later extended to forty days, and given the name \"quarantino\" from the Italian word for \"forty\".\n\nRecurrences\nSecond plague pandemic\nThe plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries. According to Jean-No\u00ebl Biraben, the plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671. (Note that some researchers have cautions about the uncritical use of Biraben's data.) The second pandemic was particularly widespread in the following years: 1360\u201363; 1374; 1400; 1438\u201339; 1456\u201357; 1464\u201366; 1481\u201385; 1500\u201303; 1518\u201331; 1544\u201348; 1563\u201366; 1573\u201388; 1596\u201399; 1602\u201311; 1623\u201340; 1644\u201354; and 1664\u201367. Subsequent outbreaks, though severe, marked the retreat from most of Europe (18th century) and northern Africa (19th century). The historian George Sussman argued that the plague had not occurred in East Africa until the 1900s. However, other sources suggest that the Second pandemic did indeed reach Sub-Saharan Africa.According to historian Geoffrey Parker, \"France alone lost almost a million people to the plague in the epidemic of 1628\u201331.\" In the first half of the 17th century, a plague killed some 1.7 million people in Italy. More than 1.25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th-century Spain.The Black Death ravaged much of the Islamic world. Plague could be found in the Islamic world almost every year between 1500 and 1850. Sometimes the outbreaks affected small areas, while other outbreaks affected multiple regions. Plague repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost 30,000\u201350,000 inhabitants to it in 1620\u201321, and again in 1654\u201357, 1665, 1691 and 1740\u201342. Cairo suffered more than fifty plague epidemics within 150 years from the plague's first appearance, with the final outbreak of the second pandemic there in the 1840s. Plague remained a major event in Ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century. Between 1701 and 1750, thirty-seven larger and smaller epidemics were recorded in Constantinople, and an additional thirty-one between 1751 and 1800. Baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague, and sometimes two-thirds of its population had died.\n\nThird plague pandemic\nThe third plague pandemic (1855\u20131859) started in China in the mid-19th century, spreading to all inhabited continents and killing 10 million people in India alone. The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, after whom the pathogen was named.Twelve plague outbreaks in Australia between 1900 and 1925 resulted in well over 1,000 deaths, chiefly in Sydney. This led to the establishment of a Public Health Department there which undertook some leading-edge research on plague transmission from rat fleas to humans via the bacillus Yersinia pestis.The first North American plague epidemic was the San Francisco plague of 1900\u20131904, followed by another outbreak in 1907\u20131908.\n\nModern-day\nModern treatment methods include insecticides, the use of antibiotics, and a plague vaccine. It is feared that the plague bacterium could develop drug resistance and again become a major health threat. One case of a drug-resistant form of the bacterium was found in Madagascar in 1995. A further outbreak in Madagascar was reported in November 2014. In October 2017, the deadliest outbreak of the plague in modern times hit Madagascar, killing 170 people and infecting thousands.An estimate of the case fatality rate for the modern bubonic plague, following the introduction of antibiotics, is 11%, although it may be higher in underdeveloped regions.\n\nSee also\nBlack Death in England\nBlack Death in medieval culture\nCrisis of the Late Middle Ages\nFlagellant\nGlobalization and disease\nList of epidemics\nSecond plague pandemic\nTimeline of plague\nPassage 2:\nPatricia Millardet\nPatricia Millardet (24 March 1957 \u2212 13 April 2020) was a French movie and television actress, who played judge Silvia Conti in the Italian mafia series La piovra.She died of a heart attack in 2020 at the age of 63.\n\nPartial filmography\nPassage 3:\nLa Rosiere de Pessac\nLa Rosi\u00e8re de Pessac (The Virgin of Pessac) is the title of two hour-long films directed by Jean Eustache (in 1968 and 1979 respectively).

It is a recomposition of an Orlando furioso written by Giovanni Alberto Ristori which had been very successfully staged by Vivaldi and his father's impresa in 1713, and whose music survives in a few fragments retained in the score of RV 819. Therefore, Vivaldi's first cataloguer Peter Ryom did not assign the opera a RV number, but catalogued it as RV Anh. 84. The libretto was by Grazio Braccioli.\n\nAuthorship\nFederico Maria Sardelli, according to the studies of Reinhard Strohm, argues that Orlando RV 819 was entirely recomposed by Vivaldi, starting from the original Ristori's opera that Vivaldi himself had already changed during the numerous representations of the season 1713. He assigned to it the catalogue number RV 819. One suggestion is that Vivaldi avoided putting his own name on the opera having himself only recently taken direction of the Teatro San Angelo. Against this others consider that the bulk of the opera is a copy of Ristori's lost work.\n\nOpera\nUnlike the Orlando furioso (RV 728) of 1727, in which the role of Orlando is sung by a contralto, the 1714 opera assigns the title role to a bass. The third act is missing and the rest of the score (evidently used in performances by the composer) is incomplete. Two arias are lost, seven arias are incomplete (only the bass part is extant) and three arias are identical with extant arias in RV 727 and RV 729.\n\nRecording\nThe French label Na\u00efve, which had already recorded the more famous Orlando furioso and Orlando finto pazzo for its Vivaldi Edition, released a recording of the July 20, 2012 premi\u00e8re at the Festival de Beaune, with Sardelli conducting Modo Antiquo and singers including Riccardo Novaro as Orlando, Ga\u00eblle Arquez as Angelica, Romina Basso as Alcina and Teodora Gheorghiu as Bradamante. Given the heavily defective nature of the surviving manuscript, Sardelli had to reconstruct or compose ex novo the seven incomplete arias, in a Vivaldian style.\n\nSee also\nList of operas by Antonio Vivaldi\nPassage 5:\nDenmark Place fire\nThe Denmark Place fire occurred on 16 August 1980 at 18 Denmark Place in Central London. The fire, caused by arson, killed 37 people of eight nationalities, most of whom were Spanish or Latin American, who were patrons of two unlicensed bars in the building. At the time, The Sunday Times suggested that it could be \"the worst mass murder in British history\".\n\nBackground\nThere were two unlicensed bars on the top two floors of 18 Denmark Place: The Spanish Rooms, a late night bar frequented by locals, including Irish and Jamaican immigrants; and Rodo's, also known as El Dandy, a salsa club popular with South American immigrants. Access to both of these bars was obtained by shouting up from the street below in order to obtain a key. The only way into both of these clubs was through a locked front door and up some stairs leading to a landing. \nAccess to the club on the lower floor was via this landing and access to the club on the upper floor was via a fire escape enclosed with plywood. Both bars, being unlicensed, were obscured from the outside world by boarded up windows and the door on Denmark Street that led to the fire escape was bolted shut. The Metropolitan Police were aware of the clubs and were planning to shut them both down on Monday 18 August. A farewell party was being thrown over the weekend.\n\nThe fire\nOn the night of 16 August 1980, John Thompson, a Scottish-born petty criminal aged 42, entered The Spanish Rooms and drank there. He believed that the barman had overcharged him for the drink. After fighting with the barman he was ejected from the building and the door was locked behind him. Thompson found a 2-gallon container outside the club, hailed a taxi and then travelled to a 24-hour petrol station in Camden where he filled the container with petrol. He then returned to 18 Denmark Place, poured the petrol through the letterbox of the front door and put a lit piece of paper through.Fire quickly took hold in the premises owing to the largely timber construction of the building. Both bars were badly damaged. There were estimated to be 150 people within the building at the time. People could not escape easily due to the boarded up windows, the locked fire escape and general lack of fire safety precautions owing to the bars' unlicensed status.The fire burned quickly through the wooden staircase, destroying the main entrance and exit to the bars. Some patrons tried to escape via the back door but found that this was locked. Others smashed windows and jumped out onto the street below. On Denmark Street there was a music shop that backed onto the clubs and some patrons were found here trapped behind the security shutters. One firefighter managed to rescue six people from this area.\nWhen firefighters were called to the fire at around 03:30 they could see smoke seeping from the shuttered windows. When an attempt was made to force the locked front door open they were showered with sparks and embers and were forced to retreat. Once firefighters were able to access the front door it took four minutes to break it down \u2013 behind it they found that the staircase was completely on fire.\nThe speed of the fire was so rapid that many of the bar patrons died where they were sitting or standing. An officer from the London Fire Brigade described the scene:\n\nPeople seem to have died on the spot without even having time to move an inch. Some were slumped at tables. Seven were at the bar and appear to have fallen as they stood, with drinks still in their hands.\n\nAftermath\nIn May 1981, Thompson was convicted on a specimen charge of murdering one of the victims, Archibald Campbell (aged 63) and sentenced to life imprisonment. He died of lung cancer on 16 August 2008, the 28th anniversary of the fire.There was comparatively little publicity about the fire, and no formal enquiry into it. The families of some of those who died were not aware of the circumstances. In 2022, after redevelopment of the site, a plaque was placed on a wall in memory.\n\nSee also\nBlue Bird Caf\u00e9 fire, 1972 fire in Montreal started in retaliations by patrons refused entry who then lit petrol in front of main entrance and only exit; also killed 37.\nHappy Land fire, 1990 fire in New York City at illegally operated nightclub started the same way by aggrieved ejected patron; resulting 87 fatalities is the worst mass murder in city history caused by a single person.\nClerkenwell cinema fire, 1994 fire in London at an illegally operated adult cinema, intentionally started by an aggrieved patron.\nGhost Ship warehouse fire, 2016 fire at illegally operated nightclub in California that killed 37\nPassage 6:\nList of bones of the human skeleton\nThe human skeleton of an adult consists of around 206 bones, depending on the counting of sternum (which may alternatively be included as the manubrium, body of sternum, and the xiphoid process). It is composed of 270 bones at the time of birth, but later decreases to 206: 80 bones in the axial skeleton and 126 bones in the appendicular skeleton. Many small accessory bones, such as sesamoid bones, are not included in this count.\n\nIntroduction\nAs a person ages, some bones fuse, a process which typically lasts until sometime within the third decade of life. Therefore, the number of bones in an individual may be evaluated differently throughout a lifetime. In addition, the bones of the skull and face are counted as separate bones, despite being fused naturally. Some reliable sesamoid bones such as the pisiform are counted, while others, such as the hallux sesamoids, are not.\nIndividuals may have more or fewer bones than the average (even accounting for developmental stage) owing to anatomical variations. The most common variations include sutural (wormian) bones, which are located along the sutural lines on the back of the skull, and sesamoid bones which develop within some tendons, mainly in the hands and feet. Some individuals may also have additional (i.e., supernumerary) cervical ribs or lumbar vertebrae. Amputations or other injuries may result in the loss of bones. Complete bone fractures may split one bone into multiple pieces. Other genetic conditions may result in abnormally higher (e.g. polydactyly or conjoined twins) or lower (e.g. oligodactyly) counts of bones.\n\nBones\nThe axial skeleton, comprising the spine, chest and head, contains 80 bones. The appendicular skeleton, comprising the arms and legs, including the shoulder and pelvic girdles, contains 126 bones, bringing the total for the entire skeleton to 206 bones. Infants are born with about 270 bones with most of it being cartilage, but will later fuse together and decrease over time to 206 bones.\n\nSpine (vertebral column)\nA fully grown adult features 26 bones in the spine, whereas a child can have 34.\n\nCervical vertebrae (7 bones)\nThoracic vertebrae (12 bones)\nLumbar vertebrae (5 bones)\nSacrum (5 bones at birth, fused into one after adolescence)\nCoccygeal vertebrae/Cordal (set of 4 bones at birth; some or all fuse together, but there seems to be a disagreement between researchers as to what the most common number should be. Some say the most common is 1, others say 2 or 3, with 4 being the least likely. It is counted as 1 in this article.)\n\nChest (thorax)\nThere are 25 bones in the chest. The chest contains cartilage for the lungs to fill with air. \n\nSternum (1 or 3 bones.

The epicentre was Ba\u015fyurt in Elaz\u0131\u011f Province, in eastern Turkey. Initial reports in global media said as many as 57 people had died. By 10 March, reports in the Turkish media placed the death toll at 41 and later, the death toll rose to 42. Another 74 were injured, many after falling and jumping from buildings. A stampede through the streets led to further injuries.The earthquake came one week to the day after the Turkish Chamber of Civil Engineers sent a report to parliament detailing inadequate building projects and the possibility that Istanbul would be destroyed by an earthquake, which could kill tens of thousands of people, at some point in the next three decades.\n\nEarthquake\nThe quake occurred on the East Anatolian Fault, a major transform fault which represents  the boundary between the Anatolian Plate and the Arabian Plate.\n\nDamage\nAccording to officials, most of the deaths occurred in three villages: Ok\u00e7ular, Yukar\u0131 Kanatl\u0131 and Kayal\u0131. At least five villages, though, suffered loss of life. Villagers fled buildings, spending the night outside and lighting fires in the streets for warmth.Thirty houses collapsed in Ok\u00e7ular, and the death toll is at least 17. Reports from the scene indicate \"the village is totally flattened\" and \"everything has been knocked down \u2013 there is not a stone in place\".At least 25 people died in Yukar\u0131 Demirci, and emergency services went to Kovanc\u0131lar.Many people used vehicles and taxis to drive to the hospital. Most were asleep at the time the quake struck, with four sleeping sisters perishing in one house. Farm animals were also killed, and minarets fell down.\n\nAftershocks\nSeveral aftershocks were felt, the strongest measuring 5.5 (at 09:47 local time), 5.1 (at 12:14) and 5.3 (at 13:12). A total of over 20 aftershocks were counted within a short time following the quake. Villagers were told to stay away from buildings for several days due to the potential of further aftershocks.Onur Tan et al. (2011) analyzed 2130 aftershocks (ML\u22650.3) and reported in Geophysical Research Letters.\n\nResponse\nTurkey: Four government ministers, including Deputy Prime Minister Cemil \u00c7i\u00e7ek, visited the scene as soon as news of the earthquake was reported. The Red Crescent and Turkey's disaster management centre donated blankets and tents. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan later arrived. Pakistan: Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani sent a condolence message to his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan over the loss of lives and property and said that \"We have learnt with utter sense of shock and profound sadness the news of the massive earthquake that has hit your beautiful country, today. Our hearts go out to our Turkish brethren over the loss of precious lives and destruction of property. I wish to convey, on behalf of the people and Government of Pakistan and on my own behalf our deepest condolences and commiserations to the people and Government of Turkey in bearing this enormous natural calamity.\" Israel: Defense Minister Ehud Barak ordered an aid proposal to be put together but later said that Turkey informed Israel that it did not require assistance at this time.\n\nSee also\n2020 Elaz\u0131\u011f earthquake\nList of earthquakes in 2010\nList of earthquakes in Turkey\nPassage 8:\nLa Cantuta massacre\nLa Cantuta massacre took place in Peru on 18 July 1992, during the presidency of Alberto Fujimori. Supposed members of Shining Path, including a university professor and nine students from Lima's La Cantuta University, were abducted, tortured, and killed by Grupo Colina, a military death squad. The incident occurred two days after the Shining Path's Tarata bombing, which killed over 40 people in Lima Province.\nThe massacre was one of the crimes cited in the conviction of Fujimori on 7 April 2009, for human rights abuses.\n\nContext\nThe Enrique Guzm\u00e1n y Valle National Education University (Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n Enrique Guzm\u00e1n y Valle, or \"UNE\"; better known as \"La Cantuta\", from the neighbourhood in which it stands) was founded as a teacher-training college in 1822, granted its university charter in 1965, closed down by the military government in 1977, and reopened in 1980.Because of its remote location, far away from the centre of Lima, the fact that most of its students hailed from the impoverished interior of the country, and that most of them intended to enter the highly politicised teaching profession, La Cantuta gained a reputation as hotbed of radical politics, such as communism and anarchism as early as the late 1950s and early 1960s. A series of student-led protest actions on the campus \u2014 including the blocking of the railway line linking Lima with the interior of the country \u2014 that led to the suspension of its activities in 1977.With the return of democratic rule in 1980, President Bela\u00fande reopened the university. The radical elements among the students and lecturers were quick to return, and by the mid-1980s the country's two main insurgent groups, Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) and the T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), had a strong presence on campus, being widely regarded as 2 very legitimate organisations. By the early 1990s, due to a strategic withdrawal by MRTA and the fragmentation of the other left-wing groups on campus, legal and illegal alike, Sendero Luminoso had the upper hand. This was in spite of operations such as that of 13 February 1987, when 4000 police officers conducted night-time raids at the dormitories of three state universities (including La Cantuta); 20 April 1989, when a joint force of police and army descended on La Cantuta University and San Marcos National University and arrested over 500 students on charges of subversion; or 22 May 1991, when, in response to a hostage crisis and rumors of an explosive device squirreled away on campus, Fujimori sent the army in to restore law and order at La Cantuta. Graffiti alluding to Sendero Luminoso and its leader, Abimael Guzm\u00e1n, were painted over with patriotic slogans; students went about their business only after passing checkpoints and under close supervision from the armed forces; and the campus remained under military control for several years.\n\nAbduction of July 1992\nIn the pre-dawn hours of 18 July 1992, two days after the Tarata bombing, members of the Army Intelligence Service (SIE) and the Army Directorate of Intelligence (DINTE), most of whom were attached to the recently established Grupo Colina death squad, burst into the residences of the Enrique Guzm\u00e1n y Valle National University.Once inside, the troops forced all the students to leave their rooms and lie belly-down on the floor. Nine students believed to be linked to the Tarata Bombing \u2014 Bertila Lozano Torres, Dora Oyague Fierro, Luis Enrique Ortiz Perea, Armando Richard Amaro C\u00f3ndor, Robert \u00c9dgar Teodoro Espinoza, Her\u00e1clides Pablo Meza, Felipe Flores Chipana, Marcelino Rosales C\u00e1rdenas, and Juan Gabriel Mari\u00f1os Figueroa \u2014 were separated from the others and taken away. Meanwhile, in the staff residences, a group of soldiers broke into the home of professor Hugo Mu\u00f1oz S\u00e1nchez. After searching his bedroom, they gagged the professor and led him away.\n\nProsecutions and amnesty\nIn April 1993, a group of Peruvian military officers anonymously released a document detailing the events at La Cantuta. Their document claimed the death squad had abducted the victims, tortured and murdered them, and then hurriedly buried them; later, they claimed, after questions had been raised in Congress, that the armed forces had exhumed, incinerated, and reburied the bodies in another location. The military whistleblowers named the members of Grupo Colina involved, identified the operations chief as Major Santiago Mart\u00edn Rivas, and suggested that the group operated on the orders of Vladimiro Montesinos, head of the National Intelligence Service (SIN) and a close advisor to President Fujimori.\nOn 6 May, Lt. Gen. Humberto Robles Espinoza, the army's third highest-ranking officer, publicly denounced a number of human rights violations committed by the SIN and the armed forces, including the La Cantuta killings. He was later dismissed from duty and subjected to death threats, and finally fled the country for political asylum in Argentina.In June 1993, Justo Arizapana Vicente, a recycler, and his friend Guillermo Cataroca, leaked a marked map to congress man Roger C\u00e1ceres Vel\u00e1squez and Radio Comas journalist Juan Jara Berrospi. C\u00e1ceres then shared the map with Ricardo Uceda at the news magazine S\u00ed, who published it in July of that year. Mariella Barreto, an agent of the Peruvian Army Intelligence Service, is also sometimes credited with leaking this map to a Peruvian magazine. An investigation of the site indicated on the map by the public prosecutor revealed four clandestine graves. Forensic tests conducted on the remains, and on another set of bones found at another site, revealed that they belonged to Mu\u00f1oz S\u00e1nchez and the students Luis Enrique Ortiz Perea, Armando Amaro Condor, and Juan Gabriel Mari\u00f1os Figueroa, and that at least some of them had been tortured prior to receiving an execution-style coup-de-gr\u00e2ce to the base of the neck. Barreto was murdered some years later: her decapitated and dismembered corpse, showing signs of ante-mortem torture, was found in March 1997. A few weeks after Mariella Barreto's death, her colleague Leonor La Rosa, was on TV in a hospital bed, declaring she had been tortured and that Barreto had been killed in retaliation for leaking information to the press about the Groupo Colina's plan to intimidate journalists and politicians from the opposition.The military authorities had begun an investigation into the killings in May 1993. In addition, in December 1993, a civilian prosecutor filed criminal charges against several named members of the military. A conflict of jurisdiction thus arose between the military and civilian courts. The controversy was placed before the Supreme Court which, on 3 February 1994, ruled that it was unable to reach agreement on which venue should apply. Consequently, on the night of 7 February, Congress enacted a new law whereby the Supreme Court could decide such matters with a simple majority, instead of a unanimous vote. By a three-to-two vote of the Supreme Court's criminal division, the case was placed under military jurisdiction.On 21 February 1994, the Supreme Council of Military Justice (CSJM) sentenced ten of the perpetrators to prison sentences of between one and 20 years.Following Fujimori's landslide re-election in April 1995, in another all-night session on 14 June 1995, Congress enacted law No. 26479, the \"Amnesty Law\", ordering the release of all police officers, soldiers, and civil servants convicted of or charged with civilian or military crimes during Peru's War on Terrorism. On 15 July, the Supreme Council of Military Justice ordered the release of all the individuals convicted for the La Cantuta killings.\n\nRepeal of the Amnesty Law\nThe Amnesty Law was repealed after the Fujimori government in 2000 and, on 21 March 2001, Attorney General Nelly Calder\u00f3n presented charges against Fujimori, accusing him of being one of the \"co-authors\" of this massacre and of the 1991 Barrios Altos massacre. She presented evidence that Fujimori, acting in concert with SIN supremo Vladimiro Montesinos, exercised control over Grupo Colina. The charges alleged that the group could not have committed crimes of this magnitude without Fujimori's express orders or consent, and that the formation and function of the Colina group was part of an overall counter-insurgency policy that involved systematic violations of human rights.\n\nProsecutions and apology\nIn November 2005, Fujimori was detained in Chile. Peruvian authorities filed for his extradition to face charges arising from various incidents during his presidency, including the La Cantuta massacre, and he was returned to Peru on 22 September 2007.\nOn 8 April 2008, a court found a number of people, including Julio Salazar, guilty of kidnapping, homicide, and forced disappearance.In October 2007, pursuant to a 2006 ruling from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the government extended a formal apology for the massacre and undertook to make amends to the victims' next-of-kin, including compensation in the amount of US$1.8 million.\n\nFujimori's trial\nDuring the trial of Alberto Fujimori, it was asserted by former Colina member Jos\u00e9 William Tena Jacinto that at least two of the victims were positively identified as Shining Path members.Lieutenant Aquilino Portella and the Dean of the Social Science Department of the University, Claudio Cajahuaringa, have also claimed that Professor Hugo Mu\u00f1oz S\u00e1nchez and student Bertila Lozano Torres were involved with Shining Path. In the case of Lozano, it was claimed that documents allegedly in her possession revealed that she was indeed an actual member of the insurgent organization.In 2009 it was determined by a judicial ruling that not a single one of the victims in La Cantuta massacre was linked to any terrorist organization, it was in the same ruling that condemned Fujimori to a 25 years imprisonment for crimes against humanity.\n\nSee also\nList of massacres in Peru\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n\"The La Canuta Case\".

It was first performed on 28 August 1721 at the Teatro Regio Ducale in Milan on the occasion of the birthday celebrations of the Austrian Empress Elisabeth Christine, wife of Emperor Charles VI of Austria.\n\nBackground\nIn 1718 Vivaldi had been nominated maestro di cappella di camera, at the court of Philipp von Hessen-Darmstadt in Mantua for whom he composed Armida al campo d'Egitto, Teuzzone, Scanderbeg (all 1718) and then Tito Manlio (1719) and La Candace (1720). On his return to Venice, following performance of La verit\u00e0 in cimento at the Teatro Sant'Angelo, Vivaldi, thinly disguised as \"Aldiviva\", became, along with Giovanni Porta, Anna Maria Strada and others, one of the principal targets of the gentleman-composer Benedetto Marcello's satirical pamphlet Il teatro alla moda (written 1718-1719, published 1720).Bissari's text had originally been written in 1710 as a play for Princess Teresa Kunegunda Sobieska, second wife of the Bavarian elector Maximillian II Emmanuel. The opera was performed again in Milan in 1723 and 1724. 8 of the arias are preserved in the Biblioteca Nazionale di Torino.\n\nRoles\nRecordings\n2001 (reconstruction of nine surviving arias) Roberta Invernizzi, Gloria Banditelli, John Elwes, Philippe Cantor.

In 1764 he made his appearance in Paris as a mandolin virtuoso and was highly esteemed, both as a performer and teacher. He published his Method for the mandolin while residing in Paris, which met with great success throughout France, being the most popular of its period.\nHis chief works were the operas L'Italienne and Pierre et Lucette, the former being an opera bouffe in one act (with the storyline or libretto by Nicolas-\u00c9tienne Framery). These works were commissioned by the Comedie Italienne, Paris, and were produced at this theatre successfully, in 1770 and 1774. Several of the songs and duets in Pierre and Lucette were exceedingly popular in France, and they were republished in Paris in 1775 and 1780.\n\nWorks\nL'Italienne  : com\u00e9die en 1 acte, m\u00eal\u00e9e d'ariettes (Paris, 1770)\nPierre et Lucette, com\u00e9die en deux actes et en prose m\u00eal\u00e9e d'ariettes (Paris, 1774)\nAirs d\u00e9tach\u00e9s de Perin et Lucette, com\u00e9die en deux actes, m\u00eal\u00e9es d'ariettes par M.

Since then he has guest directed on a vast number of series including CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, ER, Dollhouse and House. In 1997, Alcal\u00e1 made his theatrical film directing debut with the film Fire Down Below starring Steven Seagal.\nIn 2007, Alcal\u00e1 was nominated for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards for directing the Battlestar Galactica episode Exodus, Part II\n\nSelected directing credits\nPassage 2:\nLarry Alcala\nLauro \"Larry\" Zarate Alcala (August 18, 1926 \u2013 June 24, 2002) was a well-known editorial cartoonist and illustrator in the Philippines. In 2018, he was posthumously conferred the National Artist for Visual Arts title and the Grand Collar of the Order of National Artists (Order ng Pambansang Alagad ng Sining).\n\nBiography\nHe was born on August 18, 1926, to Ernesto Alcala and Elpidia Zarate in Daraga, Albay. Through a scholarship from Manila Times granted by the publisher Ram\u00f3n Roces, he obtained a degree of Bachelor of Fine Arts in Painting at the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1950. He became a professor at the same university from 1951 to 1981. He also received the Australian Cultural Award accompanied by a travel study grant in 1975.He started his cartooning career in 1946 while still attending school. After World War II, he created his very first comic strip, Islaw Palitaw, which was printed on the pages of the Filipino weekly magazine Liwayway. In 1947, he created the comic strip Kalabog en Bosyo, using Taglish as the medium of communication of his characters.\nHe pioneered animated cartoons for television commercials of products such as Darigold Milk in 1957 and Caltex in 1965. His campaign for the advancement of illustration and commercial art in the Philippines resulted to the establishment of the Visual Communication Department at the UP College of Fine Arts.In 1997, the Philippine Board on Books for Young People (PBBY) granted him the title Dean of Filipino Cartoonists, an achievement award for his lifetime dedication to the art of capturing humor in the character and everyday life in the Philippines. In 1991, he promoted the formation of a group of young children's book illustrators called Ang Ilustrador ng Kabataan (Ang INK).All in all, he made over 500 cartoon characters, twenty comic strips, six movies, two murals, and 15,000 published pages in his 56 years of professional cartooning career. He believed in the far-reaching role of cartoons in education and value formation.\n\nDeath\nAlcala died at the age of 75 on June 24, 2002, due to heart failure on Monday night at the Riverside Medical Centre, Bacolod City, central Philippines. His remains will lie in state at the Rolling Hills Memorial Chapel in the Visayas.\n\nHis Cartoons\nHis most popular cartoon series was Slice of Life, which is a reflection of the many unique aspects of everyday life in the Philippines. He captured the interest of his weekend patrons by giving them the task of looking for his image cleverly concealed within the weekend cartoon. He did the same with his other comic strip Kalabog en Bosyo. His cartoons had been tapped in advertising campaigns, such as corporate calendars, print ads, promotional T-shirts and in San Miguel Beer cans.In 1988, his Slice of Life received the Best in Humor award and was also cited for helping to keep alive the Filipino's ability to laugh at himself, through the lively marriage of art and humor, and through commentaries that are at once critical and compassionate, evoking laughter and reflection.Slice of Life appeared on the pages of the Weekend Magazine.\n\nMang Ambo\nMang Ambo is the personification of the Filipino according to Larry Alcala. Mang Ambo, the character, is an incorrigible cock-eyed innocent, possessing a small town charm amidst urban sophistication. Through Mang Ambo and the other characters of a fictional place called Barrio Bulabog, Alcala exposed the follies and foibles of Philippine society in general and of cosmopolitan life in particular. In this cartoon strip's characters, he also affirmed the Filipino's peculiar coping mechanism of laughing at himself in the face of adversity but still absorbing life's vicissitudes with resilience. Mang Ambo made its debut in 1960 as a full-page feature in the Weekly Graphic. The cartoon series later became the first Alcala comic strip to be compiled in book form.\n\nKalabog en Bosyo\nAlcala's most enduring comic strip was Kalabog en Bosyo that first appeared on the pages of Pilipino Komiks in 1947. It eventually became the longest running cartoon series created by a Filipino.Decades before Slice of Life, Alcala was already doing cameo roles in his Kalabog en Bosyo comic strips, but instead of portraying himself with a moustach, spectacles and side burns, he rendered himself in a crew-cut, younger and about 100-pounds thinner profile.An onomatopoeic Tagalog word, the name of the character, Kalabog, refers to the thud sound produced after the impact of a falling object finally reaching solid ground. In Kalabog en Bosyo, Alcala pioneered in the blending of Tagalog and English or Taglish as the medium of communication among his characters. The comic misadventures of the two bungling detectives namely Kalabog and Bosyo had been transposed into films by Sampaguita Pictures in 1957, starring the Filipino actors-comedians, Dolphy and Panchito Alba.\n\nSummary of published works\nThe following is a summary of Alcala's published works:\nInternational Cartoons, Athens, Greece (1980)\nSalon of Cartoons, Montreal, Canada (1980)\nLaugh and Live, Life Today (1981\u20132002)\nSlice of Life, Weekend (1980\u20131986), Sunday Tribune (1986\u20131987), Sunday Times (1987\u20131995), Philstar (1995\u20132002)\nBing Bam Bung, Pilipino Funny Komiks (1978\u20131989)\nAsiong Aksaya, Daily Express, Tagalog Klasiks (1976\u20131984)\nMod-Caps, Mod Magazine (1974\u20132002)\nSnickerteens, TSS Magazine (1973\u20131984)\nSmolbateribols, Darna Komiks (1972\u20131984)\nSiopawman, Daily Express (1972\u20131983, 2002)\nKalambogesyons, Pinoy Komiks (1966\u20131972)\nCongressman Kalog, Aliwan Komiks (1966\u20131972)\nBarrio Pogspak, Holiday Komiks (1966\u20131972)\nProject 13, Pioneer Komiks (1966\u20131972)\nLoverboy, Redondo Komiks (1964\u20131969)\nCartoon Feature, Asia Magazine (1963)\nMang Ambo, Weekly Graphic (1963\u20131965), Weekly Nation (1965\u20131972) Manila Standard (1993\u20131998)\nThis Business of Living, Weekly Graphic (1951\u20131965), Weekly Nation (1965\u20131972)\nBest Cartoons from Abroad, New York, US (1955\u20131956)\nTipin, Hiwaga Komiks (1951\u20131965)\nKalabog en Bosyo, Pilipino Komiks (1949\u20131983), Manila Times (1984\u20131995)\nIslaw Palitaw (1946\u20131948)\nA Cover for Asiaweek Magazine, February 10, 1984\nMga Salawikain ni Lolo Brigido, Pambata Magazine\nA Cartoon Mural for the Philippine Village Hotel\nA Mural for the Philippine Commission on Audit\nContributions for Duty Free\nContributions for Jollibee restaurant\nCaricatures and Cartoons, Private collections\nCover designs, brochures and catalogs, University of the Philippines\nSan Miguel Corporation Calendar, 1983\nSPIC Cartoonists Exhibit on Wheels, 1967 Society of Philippine Illustrators and Cartoonists (SPIC)\nAsiong Aksaya TV show, Energy Conservation Movement of the Philippines, 1977\n\nContributions to Philippine education\nThe following are Alcala's contributions to education in the Philippines:\nIntroduced the first college degree course on Commercial Design in the Philippines, 1953\nIntroduced the first 8 mm film production of animated cartoons in Visual Communications course, 1972\nChairman Department of Visual Communications, University of the Philippines, 1978\u20131981\nProfessor, College of Fine Arts, University of the Philippines, 1976\u20131979\nAssociate Professor, College of Fine Arts, University of the Philippines, 1971\u20131976\nAssistant Professor, College of Fine Arts, University of the Philippines, 1962\u20131970\nInstructor, College of Fine Arts, University of the Philippines, 1951\u20131962\n\nCartoon exhibitions\nThe following are exhibitions of Alcala's cartoons:\n1999 Larry Alcala & Friends: Cartoons and Caricatures Show, The Westin Philippine Plaza (now Sofitel Philippine Plaza), CCP Complex, Roxas Boulevard,\n1998 Larry Alcala, Life and Times of a Cartoonist, Museo Pambata Foundation, Inc.\n1998 Cartoon Festival, Seoul, Korea\n1995 Asian Cartoonist Exhibition and Symposium, Japan\n1995 Slices of Larry's Art, SM Megamall Art Center & Liongoren Art Gallery\n1993 Cartoons, Solo exhibit, San Jose & San Francisco, California, U.S.A.\n1991 Cartoons, Group exhibit, Japan\n1990 ASEAN Cartoonist Exhibit, Tokyo, Japan\n1989 Cartoon Exhibit, China\n1988 Slices of Life Part 2, Art Association of Bacolod Gallery\n1987 Slices of Life Here and Abroad, Hyatt Regency Manila\n1987 Cartoons, Group exhibit, Hiroshima, Japan\n1986 Cartoons, Solo exhibit, Bratislava, Czechoslovakia\n1985 Cartoons, Group exhibit, Chicago, San Francisco & Los Angeles, U.S.A.\n1984 1st Asian Cartoonist Conference, Hiroshima, Japan\n1984 Larry Alcala's First One-Man Exhibition, Heritage Art Center\n1982 SKP Exhibit in Australia\n\nProfessional and journalistic achievements\nThe following is an enumeration of Alcala's professional and journalistic accomplishments:\nArt Director, Weekly Nation, 1965\u20131972\nEditorial Cartoonist and Illustrator, Weekly Graphic, 1961\u20131964\nTV Art Consultant, Citizens Award for Television (CCMM) 1971\u20131972\nTV Animated Cartoon Commercial for Darigold Milk, 1969\nArt Consultant, U.P.

Number of social workers supported him to start and establish around 20 branches of Al-Ameen Educational Society and 200 institutions throughout India.\n\nHistory\nMumtaz Ahmed Khan is the founder of Al-Ameen Educational Society. At the age of 31, in 1966 Khan founded the Al-Ameen Movement. He had decided to name it The Bangalore Educational Society. He was advised against this by his friend Khader Hussein who suggested Al-Ameen Educational Society as a reference to the title given to Prophet Muhammad which meant The Trustworthy. Hussein later became the principle of Saboo Siddiq Polytechnic, Bombay.\nAbbasiya Begum, a female member of the Karnataka Legislative Council was elected the first chairperson of this society.A number of social workers supported him for starting and establishing around 20 branches of Al-Ameen Educational Society and 200 institutions throughout India.\n\nStructure\nActivities\nPlanning Commission of India member Syeda Saiyidain Hameed was awarded Al-Ameen All India Community Leadership Award - 2006 by the Secretary, Chairman and Vice Chairman on 23 January 2007.\n\nInstitutions\nAl-Ameen College of Pharmacy\nAl-Ameen College of Law\nAl-Ameen Arts, Science and Commerce Degree College\nAl-Ameen College of Education\nAl-Ameen Institute of Management Studies\nAl-Ameen Institute of Information Sciences\nAl-Ameen Pre University College\nAl-Ameen Primary & High School\nPassage 4:\nReserve Officers' Training Corps (Philippines)\nReserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) in the Philippines is one of three components of the National Service Training Program, the civic education and defense preparedness program for Filipino college students. ROTC aims to provide military education and training for students to mobilize them for national defense preparedness. Its specific objectives include preparation of college students for service in the Armed Forces of the Philippines in the event of an emergency and their training to become reservists and potential commissioned officers of the AFP.\nGraduates of the ROTC advance program serve in all branches of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. In 2008, ROTC graduates of the officer candidate schools of the various services constituted roughly 75% of the AFP officer corps. The ROTC grants qualified student-cadets scholarship benefits through a merit-based incentive program in return for an obligation of military service in the reserve force, or active duty in the AFP if given the opportunity, after graduation.\nROTC student-cadets attend college like other students, but also receive basic military training and officer training from the branch of service that handles their school's ROTC unit. The students participate in regular ROTC instruction during the school year (one school year for Basic ROTC student-cadets and three school years for Advance ROTC cadet-officers), and extended training activities during the summer, such as the ROTC Summer Camp Training (RSCT) and the Advance ROTC Academic Phase Training (ARAPT).\nROTC units in colleges and universities are organized through the Department of Military Science and Tactics (DMST) which is under joint supervision by the school administration and the Department of National Defense. These ROTC units are in turn managed by active duty officers of the AFP and the reservist organization representatives of the major services, the Philippine Army Reserve Command of the Philippine Army, the Philippine Navy Reserve Command of the Philippine Navy and the Philippine Air Force Reserve Command of the Philippine Air Force.\n\nNomenclature\nCommonwealth Act No. 1, the National Defense Act of 1935, referred to the ROTC as the \"Reserve Officers Training Corps\", whereas Republic Act No. 7077, the Citizen Armed Forces of the Philippines Reservist Act of 1991, referred to the ROTC as the \"Reserve Officers' Training Corps\", ascribing the possessive form to the word \"officers\". \nRepublic Act No. 9163, the National Service Training Program Act of 2001 likewise uses the same possessive form as RA 7077.\n\nHistory\nROTC in the Philippines began in 1912 when the Philippine Constabulary commenced with military instruction at the University of the Philippines. The university's Board of Regents then made representations to the United States Department of War through the Governor-General and received the services of a United States Army officer who took on the duties of a professor of Military Science. Through this arrangement, the first official ROTC unit in the Philippines was established in the University of the Philippines on July 3, 1922.In 1921, National University became the first private college in the Philippines to have an ROTC unit.  Later in the same year, Ateneo de Manila University, Liceo de Manila, and Colegio de San Juan de Letran soon followed suit and organized their own respective ROTC units. In 1936, the Office of the Superintendent for ROTC Units under the Philippine Army was activated to supervise all ROTC units in the country.\n\nNational Defense Act of 1935\nPresident Manuel L. Quezon issued Executive Order No. 207 in 1939 in order to implement the National Defense Act of 1935, otherwise known as Commonwealth Act No. 1, the embodiment of the national defense plan formulated by General Douglas MacArthur for the Philippine Commonwealth. This executive order made ROTC obligatory at all colleges and universities with a total enrollment of 100 students and greater. This measure was made in order to help fill out the reserve force requirement of 400,000 men by 1946 and especially for junior reserve officers.\n\nWorld War II\nAt the onset of World War II in 1941, thirty-three colleges and universities in the Philippines had organized ROTC units, the cadets and officers of which would see action for the first time. Elements from different ROTC units in Metro Manila took part in the Battle of Bataan. ROTC cadets of Silliman University in the Visayas made up 45% of the strength of the 75th Infantry Regiment of the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). Various ROTC units joined volunteers from the Philippine Military Academy to form the Hunters ROTC guerrilla group, which took part in the resistance movement during the Japanese occupation after the last American and Filipino forces had surrendered.\n\nPost-World War II\nOn September 13, 1946, the Philippine Army Headquarters reactivated the pre-war ROTC units. The Philippine Army became the Armed Forces of the Philippines on December 23, 1950, at which time the Philippines was divided into four military areas and ROTC units operating within these areas fell under the supervision of their respective Area Commanders. On February 8, 1967, President Ferdinand Marcos rescinded Executive Order No. 207 of 1939, promulgating Executive Order No. 59 in its place. This executive order made ROTC mandatory at all colleges, universities, and other institutions with an enrollment of 250 male students and greater. President Marcos also issued Presidential Decree No. 1706, otherwise known as the \"National Service Law\", on August 8, 1980. It made national service obligatory for all Filipino citizens and specified three categories of national service: civic welfare service, law enforcement service, and military service.\n\nRepublic Act 7077\nRepublic Act 7077, otherwise known as the \"Citizen Armed Forces of the Philippines Reservist Act\", was enacted by the 8th Congress of the Philippines on June 27, 1991. The Reservist Act provided for the organization, training, and utilization of reservists, referred to in the Act as \"Citizen Soldiers\". The primary pool of manpower for the reservist organization is graduates of the ROTC basic and advanced courses.\n\nControversy\nA period of discontent over ROTC's conduct and the corruption that often plagued its individual units had long been fermenting prior to 2000. Filipino student websites often contain short essays regarding the alleged pointlessness of the program. Student groups would occasionally include ROTC in their roster of grievances, whereas lawmakers would introduce resolutions intended to abolish ROTC.Into this national mood of resentment fell a tragedy that would have a significant impact on the Philippine ROTC program. Mark Welson Chua, a student of the University of Santo Tomas and a member of the UST ROTC unit, was found dead, his body floating in the Pasig River on March 18, 2001. Prior to his death, he and another student had reported an account of alleged corruption within the UST ROTC unit to the school's student publication. The National Bureau of Investigation would later conclude that members of the UST ROTC unit were responsible for Chua's death. One of the suspects would be sentenced to death three years later.The incident set off an explosion of anti-ROTC sentiment as student associations, school administrators and other cause-oriented groups focused on protests and parliamentary approaches to the matter. The Congress of the Philippines took up the legal challenge; generating no less than seventeen bills and resolutions in both houses of Congress, in response to the clamor. Many of the bills mentioned Mark Chua in the text, acknowledging his death as the catalyst for reform.\n\nRepublic Act 9163\nRepublic Act 9163, otherwise known as the \"National Service Training Program (NSTP) Act of 2001\", was Congress' answer to the clamor for change in the ROTC program. It was promulgated by the 12th Congress of the Philippines on January 23, 2002. Under the NSTP Program, both male and female college students of any baccalaureate degree course or technical vocational course in public or private educational institutions are obliged to undergo one of three program components, one of which is ROTC, for an academic period of two semesters. However, ROTC as a pre-requisite for graduation was rescinded.\n\nImpact on Philippine society\nThe ROTC program of the Philippines was for many decades a compelling aspect affecting the lives of male youths whom many despises it and even question it as to its relevance in pursuing a college education. It was also a significant contributor to the corruption and abuses within the ranks of the subject as expose by Mark Welson Chua before being murdered by his fellow ROTC Officers. But unbeknownst to the public, the ROTC program has undergone numerous unacknowledged name changes, like in the 1960s through the mid-1970s it was called \"Philippine Military Training\" or PMT, and then from the late 1970s up to the early 1990s it was called \"Citizen Military Training\" or CMT, also advance training did not begin until the mid-1970s when cadets who desired to be cadet officers underwent what was called \"Cadet Officers Candidate Course\" or COCC.\n\nArmed Forces of the Philippines\nAs of 2008, ROTC graduates of the various services constituted roughly 75% of the AFP officer corps; the rest come from the ranks of the Philippine Military Academy. Among the more prominent graduates of the Philippine ROTC program are Gen. Alfredo M. Santos, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines from 1962 to 1965 and the first four-star general of the AFP, Gen. Rigoberto J. Atienza, 9th Chief of Staff of the AFP and for whom Camp Atienza in Quezon City is named, and Gen. Romeo C. Espino, the longest-serving AFP Chief of Staff who served from January 15, 1972, to August 16, 1981. Gen. Santos was a civil engineering graduate of Mapua Institute of Technology and was the Corp Commander of the Mapua Institute of Technology Reserve Officers' Training Corps; Gen. Atienza, a civil engineering graduate of the University of the Philippines, and Gen. Espino an agriculture graduate of University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os. Another notable ROTC graduate was Gen. Fabian C. Ver, AFP Chief of Staff under Ferdinand Marcos and director general of the National Intelligence and Security Authority.\n\nPost-2001 ROTC\nAt present, ROTC is no longer a mandatory program for college students, but an optional program component of the NSTP. The ROTC program accepts both male and female cadets. According to the latest available data, there has been a significant reduction in the number of students enrolling in ROTC. From more than 800,000 enrolled cadets during the 1999-2000 school year, ROTC enrollment has dropped to 150,000 as of 2011. During the first quarter of 2011, 500 colleges and universities were participating in the ROTC program. This is a sharp decline from the 2,000 schools offering ROTC before the National Service Training Program was enforced.According to the Commission on Higher Education, the ROTC component of NSTP has produced 1,435,000 graduates over a ten-year period from 2002 to 2012. In comparison, the CWTS and LTS components of NSTP has produced 8,614,000 and 538,700 graduates respectively.\n\nProposals for and against mandatory implementation\nIn 2006, Alfredo Lim sponsored Senate Bill 2224 and Representative Eduardo Gullas sponsored House Bill 5460, seeking to make ROTC again mandatory. In June 2013, Department of National Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin aired a proposal to make ROTC once again mandatory for college students, a move ardently being protested by progressive youth groups such as Anakbayan. There have also been reports of schools offering merchant marine courses that want to retain the ROTC program as mandatory, arguing that maritime companies prefer mariners with ROTC training.Members of the House of Representatives of the 16th Congress of the Philippines have filed at least six house bills related to the ROTC program. Congressmen Francis Abaya, Rodolfo Biazon, Erico Aumentado, Sherwin Gatchalian and Manny Pacquiao have proposed reinstating the mandatory nature of ROTC training, while Kabataan Party-list representative Terry Ridon has proposed the outright abolishment of the program.\nIn February 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte approved the proposal to revive the mandatory nature of ROTC training for senior high school students in both public and private schools. Duterte certified the proposal as urgent and forwarded it to the Congress of the Philippines - House of Representatives (Lower House) and Senate (Upper House). On May 21, 2019, the Lower House passed their version of the proposed law. Some camps have criticized Duterte's inclination on this issue for admitting in a speech in 2016 that he himself did not finish his supposed ROTC service during his university days,  and two years later, expounded that he even falsified medical documents to be able to do so.After the 2022 presidential elections, Vice President-elect Sara Duterte stated that she wants mandatory ROTC training under priority legislation. In July, Senators Francis Tolentino and Robin Padilla announced support for a bill by Senator Ronald Dela Rosa that would introduce mandatory ROTC for students in grades 11 and 12, with a voluntary advanced ROTC program available for the first two years of higher education. President Bongbong Marcos stated in his first State of the Nation address, also in July, that reinstituting the ROTC as a mandatory component of senior high school programs in all public and private tertiary-level educational institutions is one of his priority bills. \nGroups such as the Student Christian Movement of the Philippines denounced Marcos, Jr. for prioritizing the reinstitution of mandatory Reserve Officers' Training Corps as was said in his 2022 State of the Nation Address, saying that it will teach students blind obedience and make them vulnerable to abuses.\n\nNotable Philippine ROTC units\nThe University of the Philippines Diliman ROTC Unit\nUniversity of Santo Tomas Golden Corps of Cadets\nMap\u00faa Institute of Technology ROTC Unit\nFEATI University ROTC Unit\nAteneo de Manila University ROTC Unit 131st Department of Air Science and Tactics\n\nSee also\nConscription in the Philippines\nStudent Regiment (Indonesia)\nReserve Officer Training Unit (Malaysia)\nReserve Officers' Training Corps (South Korea)\nReserve Officers' Training Corps (Taiwan)\nUniversity Regiments (Australia)\nOfficers' Training Corps (United Kingdom)\nReserve Officers' Training Corps (United States)\nPassage 5:\nHelmut Schmidt University\nThe Helmut Schmidt University (German: Helmut-Schmidt-Universit\u00e4t), located in Hamburg, Germany, is a German military educational establishment that was founded in 1973 at the initiative of the then-Federal Minister of Defence, Helmut Schmidt. Originally known as the \"University of the Bundeswehr Hamburg\" (Universit\u00e4t der Bundeswehr), its complete official name today is \"Helmut-Schmidt-Universit\u00e4t/Universit\u00e4t der Bundeswehr Hamburg\". Teaching first started in Autumn of 1973. It is one of two universities that were established by the Bundeswehr to train and educate its future and existing officers.\nIn general, it is accessible only to officers and officer candidates of the Bundeswehr, hence its original name. However, since it started teaching, there have been cooperation agreements with allied countries, on the basis of which a handful of selected officers from these states have been able to study in Hamburg.\nSince 2002 there has been a small number of civilian students at the university. A prerequisite for studying as a civilian at the Helmut Schmidt University is a business scholarship. These scholarships are usually awarded by foundations with close relationships to industry \u2013 thus, these students are at least indirectly being supported by their future employer, usually large companies. As of 2022 tuition costs are currently 2941 euros (humanities), 4403 euros (economics) or 3423 euros (engineering) per academic term.Academic degrees and titles obtained at HSU are equivalent to those awarded by state universities and are equally valid, since the courses comply with the requirements of Hamburg's higher education legislation. The university is authorised to confer habilitations and doctoral degrees.\n\nHistory\nChronology of establishment\nOn 11 June 1970, the Federal Minister of Defense at the time, Helmut Schmidt, for whom the university was later named and who later would become chancellor of Germany, published a decree that a university be established for the purpose of schooling certain members of the German Federal Armed Forces.\nOn 17 May 1971 the decree, passed a year earlier by Schmidt, was appraised.The German Federal Armed Forces agreed 29 June 1972 to collaborate with Schmidt's ideas for the university. The agreement was finalised 3 October 1972 and legally concluded.\nThe first classes of students began schooling on 1 October 1973 and the first graduate left the university on 30 September 1976.\n\nPresidents\nSince the beginning of the university in 1973, there have been eight presidents of the institution, including the current president, Wilfried Seidel, who has been in office since 2010.\n\nRenaming\nIt was in the December 2003 that the University of the German Federal Armed Forces Hamburg was rechristened \"Helmut Schmidt University / University of the German Federal Armed Forces Hamburg\" to honour the man who passed the decree for the university's establishment. The idea of a university is his brainchild. Schmidt was present at the ceremony and was awarded an honorary degree.\n\nOrganisation and courses\nAt the Helmut Schmidt University there is a specific organizational structure, in addition to the division between the areas of teaching and administration that is common to all universities, there is a military side, to accommodate the HSU's dual function as an educational establishment and a military authority for the students.\n\nAcademic division\nThe academic division takes care of teaching and research, to which end it maintains 4 faculties. The number of departments was designed so as to allow for intensive study through teaching in small groups, and for the pursuing of research at the same time.\n\nFaculty of Electrical Engineering: 13 professorships\nElectrical Engineering\nParts of Industrial Engineering\nFaculty of Mechanical Engineering: 7 departments, 19 professorships\nMechanical Engineering\nComputational Science and Engineering\nParts of Industrial Engineering\nFaculty of Humanities and Social Sciences: 9 departments, 28 professorships\nEducational Sciences\nHistory\nPsychology\nFaculty of Economic and Social Sciences: 19 departments, 40 professorships\nBusiness Administration\nEconomics\nPolitical Science\nParts of Industrial Engineering\nNotes:The course Industrial Engineering is not assigned to any one faculty, due to its mixed nature, but the Faculty of Electrical Engineering has taken the leading role in teaching it. The exam board consists of members of the 3 participating faculties in equal number.\nThe \"ISA-Modul\", with ISA standing for \"Interdisziplin\u00e4re Studienanteile\" (Interdisciplinary parts of study) is not assigned to a particular faculty. Its classes take place in all faculties. All ISA courses are coordinated by a research associate, who liaises with the teaching staff of the 4 faculties.\n\nStudent Body Regiment\nThe student body of the university is organised in the Student Body Regiment (German: \"Studierendenbereich\", short: StudBer, lit.: \"student area\"). The regiment is commanded by an officer of the rank of colonel or captain at Sea (NATO Rank Code OF-5). Apart from headquarters staff, they oversee 3 battalions (German: \"Studierendenfachbereiche\", short: StudFBer, lit.: \"student subject area\"). These are commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel or Commander (NATO Rank Code OF-4). To ensure parity between the branches, A battalion is usually commanded by a member of the navy (German: Marine), B battalion by a member of the air force (German: Luftwaffe) and C battalion by a member of the army (German: Heer). They usually also hold the title of Senior Branch Officer (i.e. Senior Naval/Air Force/Army Officer on Campus).\n\nA Battalion: Engineering\nB Battalion: Educational Sciences, History, Psychology\nC Battalion: Political and Economic SciencesEach battalion consists of several companies (German: \"Studierendenfachbereichsgruppen\", short: StudFBerGrp, lit.: \"student subject area groups\"), commandend by an army or air force captain or a naval lieutenant (NATO Rank Code OF-2). In the course of the reforms of army training and the correspondingly higher student numbers in 2007 and 2008, further company commanders were added for the period 2007\u20132011 and again in 2019. A battalion currently has 5 companies, B battalion has 8 companies and C battalion has 9. Each company has between 100 and 150 student officers and cadets. Apart from the administrative management of the soldiers, the Student Body Regiment undertakes the military training and advanced education of their personnel, in order to hone individual common core skills.\n\nStudying\nThe academic year at the HSU usually begins on 1 October. The officers and officer candidates are generally posted to the university a week before that date. An orientation week takes place first, during which the students may settle into their accommodation and receive an introduction to studying at the HSU from the more advanced students.\nIn contrast to the semester format usually practised in Germany, a year at the HSU is divided into 3 terms (trimesters) which means that it consists not of a winter and summer semester, but of autumn, winter and spring terms, 3 blocks of 3 months each. There are no classes in the summer quarter (1 July \u2013 30 September). This period may be used for performing required periods of practical training and internships, and for holidays.\nExams are taken at the end of every term, and test the material that was studied in that term. In a few cases, exams at the end of a term may concern the material of more than one term. For the purpose of revision, one or two weeks in mid-December, late March and late June may be devoid of classes.\nDue to the short length of revision time and the fact that all the exams are \"en bloc\", resits are greatly feared by the students, particularly the engineering students. Resit exams occur during the exam block of the next term, and in this way a \"bow wave\" of an ever-increasing number of exams to take can accumulate, which may be very difficult to remain on top of.\nThe standard period of study for the master's degree (the standard degree) is 4 years. A Bachelor's degree can be obtained in 3 years. The maximum period of study is 4 years, which means that one's Master's thesis must be submitted on 30 September of the 4th year of study at the latest. The study period may only be extended over 4 years with the permission of the Personnel Office of the Bundeswehr, and even then, one requires a certificate from the university stating that the student is likely to successfully complete his or her studies in the near future.\nAfter completion of one's studies, that is after one has submitted one's final dissertation, the officer will return to a post in the army or the fleet relatively quickly, according to availability of vacant posts, the officer's leave entitlement and course plans.\nThe award of the study diplomas always occurs in mid-October in a formal ceremony. As part of the graduation ceremony, the B\u00f6ttcher-Preis, founded by the Hamburg businessman Johann Max B\u00f6ttcher, is awarded to the highest-performing students of each year.\nSome alumni officers will return to their alma mater as researchers or doctoral students.\n\nFacilities\nThe maintains some central facilities. These include the computer centre, the language centre, the media centre, and the Centre for Technology-Assisted Education (Zentrum f\u00fcr technologiegest\u00fctzte Bildung: ZTB). A further facility is the library of the HSU. According to the library ranking list \"Bibliotheksindex\" (BIX), it has been amongst the best libraries in Germany for years. The library primarily exists to support the teaching and research of the HSU, but is also accessible to the general public.\n\nResearch focus\nIn Mechanical Engineering, one of the areas of research is in automotive engineering. 7 professorships work on projects in this area, including:\nAcoustics,\nPropulsion,\nComputer-aided engineering,\nChassis,\nProduction engineering, and\nSimulators.\nFor example, a hybrid drive unit is being researched for industrial trucks in cooperation with industry.\nIn Electrical Engineering, one of the areas of research is telecommunications, which includes: \nAudio coding,\nWireless transmission systems, and\nVideo recognition systems.\nIn educational sciences, the focus is on the areas of professional and organizational education, adult education and history. The establishment of a uniform German Qualifications Framework in the context of the European Qualifications Framework may be traced back in no small part to the work of the professor for professional and organizational education in the working group of the Federal Ministry for Education and Research, through expert advice and support.\nIn economic and management sciences, the emphasis is on logistics, business administration and economics, and political science. Gender topics have also been researched for years.\n\nStudent life\nCampus and accommodation\nThe HSU is designed as a campus university, and its campus in the Wandsbek district consists of 3 parts. Studying activities take place on the premises of the former Douaumont barracks on the Holstenhofweg in Hamburg-Jenfeld. The university administration is located here, as well as all departments and faculties, lecture theatres and laboratories and central facilities; it also contains sports facilities, the canteen and the management of the Student Division. Students of Engineering are accommodated here in 10 quite modern-looking residential buildings. South of the BAB 24, on the premised of the former Hanseatic barracks in the Stoltenstra\u00dfe in Horn, is the accommodation for students of humanities and social sciences, and economics, and the medical facility. A third residence, rapidly constructed, is located since 2007 on the Jenfelder Allee and will be used until 2010. In addition, from 2007 to 2010, flats will be rented on the private market, in order to absorb the overload of students, which is due to the unusually well-attended years of 2007 and 2008. In the private flats, 2 to 3 students will be accommodated together. In principle, every student receives a single room with area of 14 to 20 m2 (151 to 215 sq ft), mostly with en-suite bathroom and toilet. During the time of higher than usual student numbers however, there will inevitably be some instances where 2 students share a larger room. Residents may cook in the shared kitchens, where the social life between studies and the Hamburg night life will take place. Due to structural changes in military training, several external residences had to be acquired including the former Lettow-Vorbeck Barracks, which is now used by the Federal Police (Bundespolizei). Another facility frequented by students and staff is the casino, the officer's club of the HSU (not a gambling establishment), located opposite the campus.\n\nFinancing\nWhilst studying, the soldiers are paid according to their rank and length of service, sometimes including a residence allowance and a family allowance. They pay a fixed fee for their accommodation, which is waived if the student takes up a private residence.\n\nLeisure activities and nightlife\nDue to the quite strict study plan, compared with public universities, it is often not easy for students to pursue leisure activities. In the course of the years, however, many different clubs and societies have been formed, to enable leisure activities without clashing with study obligations.\nOne large event in the academic year is the \"TAF (\"Trimesteranfangsfeier\" or \"Start of term ceremony\"). This takes place annually to greet the new students. It is organized by the members of the \"Studentischer Konvent\" and enjoys widespread popularity. The Studentischer Konvent is the students' representation at the HSU. The offers first-term students a possibility to get to know each other, and more advanced students the possibility to swap tales from their holidays.\nFurther events are organized in the faculties. These include:\n\n\"WI-Party\" (last weekend of October, organized by the senior year of engineering students, with about 900 guests the largest closed event at the HSU)\n\"P\u00e4d-Party\" (mid- to late June, an open-air party in the Douaumont area, the home of the engineering students, organized by Education Sciences students)\n\nConditions of enrollment\nThere are several conditions of enrollment which are strictly observed at the university.\nIn general, studying at the HSU entails a mandatory service of 12 years as an officer in the Bundeswehr. Since 2008, that time has been increased to 13 years, in response to changes in the education caused by the introduction of the Bachelor/Master system. To join the officer corps, a 3-day selection process must be successfully completed at the officer candidates selection centre in K\u00f6ln-Porz at the Mudra barracks. Depending on which service branch and which specialty one chooses, one will complete the requisite military training with that unit, before being posted to the university and completing the academic education there, which is a part of the training for becoming an officer.\nThe educational requirement for attending the HSU is a general higher education entrance qualification that is recognized by the law on higher education of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg.\n\nMilitary aspects of student life\nPrior to their studies, soldiers must train at one of the three respective Officer Training school: for the Army in Dresden /('OSH'), for the Air Force in F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck ('OSLw') and for the Navy in Flensburg ('MSM').\nDuring their stay at the HSU, military personnel are required to complete certain standard procedures every year. These include:\n\n6/12 km marches on foot with 15 kg backpack\nGerman Sports Badge\nBasic Fitness Tests\nNBC Training\nFirst Aid Training\nSmall Arms TrainingOn occasion:\n\npolitical education\nTraining courses (such as MOUT etc.)\nMilitary ceremonies (such as changing of Commandants etc.)\n\nSee also\nEducation in Hamburg\nList of universities in Germany\nUniversity of the German Federal Armed Forces\nBundeswehr University Munich\nPassage 6:\nNorth Dakota School for the Deaf\nThe North Dakota School for the Deaf (NDSD) is a state-funded residential school located in Devils Lake, North Dakota that provides services to meet the educational needs of children who are deaf and hard of hearing. NDSD is under the direction, control, and management of the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction. The current superintendent of the school is Dr. Connie Hovendick.\n\nHistory\nBefore the Dakota Territory was divided, deaf children living in the part of the territory now known as North Dakota had to do without an education or attend the school in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Because of poor roads, great distances, meager railroads, and general financial inability, few of the North Dakota children could attend the South Dakota School for the Deaf. In the fall of 1889 Anson R. Spear, a deaf man from Minneapolis, Minnesota, came to North Dakota to establish a school for the deaf. Mr. Spear's political backers, Senator Swanston and Representative McCormick, introduced a bill in the Legislature for the immediate establishment for the proposed school in Devils Lake. The bill passed March 15, 1890, over the veto of Governor John Miller.The citizens of Devils Lake furnished free for two years a wooden building located at the corner of Third Avenue and Fifth Street. Mr. Spear was appointed superintendent on August 1, 1890, and the first term began September 10, 1890. The first student to be enrolled was 10-year-old Mabel Alice Newton. By the end of the first school year, 23 children were enrolled. The combined method of communication - use of signs, hand alphabet, and oral method - was used to teach the students. In January 1891, money was appropriated by the State Legislature for a permanent building.\nThe Great Northern Railway donated an 18-acre (73,000 m2) tract of land one mile (1.6 km) north of the heart of Devils Lake for the permanent site of NDSD, and construction of the first building \"Old Main\" began on May 30, 1892. \"Old Main\" was designed by Olof Hanson, a rising Deaf architect from Faribault, Minnesota.\nThe school previously had an in-house high school. In the late 1930s it had 140 students, its peak enrollment. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), first passed in the 1970s, started a trend of deaf students enrolling at local public schools as well as in specialized programs in the larger towns around the state. The average enrollment in the 1980s was 97 students. By the 1990s the average enrollment was down to 48. The last graduating class was in 2004, and in 2012 it ended direct high school operations. In 2019 the school had 18 students.\n\nCampus\nIt includes dormitory facilities. The Blackhurst Dormitory and the cafeteria serve the students.\n\nOperations\nNDSD directly teaches grades K-8 while it sends students in grades 9-12 to Devils Lake High School, operated by Devils Lake Public Schools.\n\nAthletics\nIn the past, NDSD fielded teams in baseball, football, basketball, track and field, etc. Back then, the school had a large enough student population to have enough athletes to compete with various small towns in the area. Due to the reduction in the number of students through mainstream school placement, the school entered into co-op athletic agreements with a couple towns - one was with Crary, although the school now has a co-op agreement with the Devils Lake public schools. In the past, the nickname for the school's teams has always been the Bulldogs; the school's team colors have also always been green and white.\n\nBoys' Sports\nFootball (with Devils Lake High School)\nBasketball (began in 1914)\nTrack\nGirls' Sports\nBasketball\nTrack\n\nNewsletter\nThe Banner, the official newsletter of NDSD, was first published in 1891. Clara Halvorson, the first teacher employed at the school, is credited with naming the Banner. The purpose of the newsletter was to keep parents informed on what happened at the school, publish pupils\u2019 school work, and to provide publishing experience to students. The Banner is still published today.\n\nSuperintendents\nPast Superintendents of the North Dakota School for the Deaf include:\nAnson R. Spear\nDwight F. Bangs\nJ. W. Blattner\nFrank Read\nW. C.

Olson - archivist & actor\nPassage 7:\nTiberius Coruncanius\nTiberius Coruncanius (died 241 BC) was a consul of the Roman Republic in 280 BC. As a military commander in that year and the following, he was known for the battles against Pyrrhus of Epirus that led to the expression \"Pyrrhic victory\". He was the first plebeian Pontifex Maximus, and possibly the first teacher of Roman law to offer public instruction.\n\nBiography\nCoruncanius, of plebeian descent, is believed to have hailed from Tusculum.He was first elected consul in 280 BC with Publius Valerius Laevinus, and led an expedition into Etruria against the Etruscan cities.  When Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Italia, and defeated the Roman legions of Laevinus at the Battle of Heraclea, Tiberius' legions were recalled to Rome to bolster the defense of Roman territory.\nIn 254 BC or 253 BC, he was the first plebeian elected Pontifex Maximus, or chief priest of the Roman Republic, which position had been previously monopolized by patricians. He died in 241 BC and was succeeded by Lucius Caecilius Metellus, another plebeian.\n\nImpact\nHe was the first who publicly professed law (publice professus est), known to be both eloquent and full of knowledge. Like Socrates, he left no writings.\nHis public legal instruction had the effect of creating a class of legally skilled non-priests (jurisprudentes), a sort of consultancy. After Coruncanius' death, instruction gradually became more formal, with the introduction of books on law beyond the then scant official Roman legal texts.It is possible that as the first plebeian Pontifex Maximus, Coruncanius allowed members of the public and students of the law of Ancient Rome to attend his consultations tasked with giving legal advice to citizens. These consultations were probably held outside the College of Pontiffs, and thus accessible to all those interested. As such, he became the first teacher of Roman law (how students of law learned their material earlier is unknown).\nPassage 8:\nGrace Fernald\nGrace Maxwell Fernald (November 29, 1879 \u2013 January 16, 1950) was an educational psychologist and influential figure in early twentieth century literacy education. Fernald established \"the first clinic for remedial instruction in 1921 at the University of California, Los Angeles\". Tracing tactile learning tendencies back to Quintilian, S\u00e9guin, and Montessori, Fernald's kinesthetic spelling and reading method prompted struggling students to trace words. Years of research culminated in 1943 with her classic work, Remedial Techniques in Basic School Subjects. The popular kinesthetic method anchors modern instruction in the areas of special education and remedial reading. Kinesthetic learning is also included as one of Howard Gardner's multiple intelligences. Fernald's notion of incorporating the physical with the auditory, verbal, and visual elements of reading instruction, now known as \"VAKT\", multimodal learning, or multisensory imagery, continues to guide educators today.\n\nEarly years and education\nGrace Maxwell Fernald was born on November 29, 1879 in Clyde, Ohio. Following a youth spent in New York and New Jersey, Fernald graduated from high school and then attended college at Mount Holyoke and Bryn Mawr. In 1907 she received her doctorate in psychology from the University of Chicago. By 1911 Fernald had accepted a position at UCLA. She eventually became head of the Psychology Department and Laboratory at the State Normal School. It was at the UCLA clinic where her research into the reading and writing processes gained fame.\n\nEarly research of the Fernald method\nThe 1921 Journal of Educational Research contains Fernald's foundational study of four boys who learn to spell and read by her kinesthetic method. This method influenced other researchers working at the same time in the field of reading difficulties. Notable examples include Samuel Orton and Anna Gillingham. The article in the Journal of Educational Research, \"The Effect of Kinaesthetic Factors in the Development of Word Recognition in the Case of Non-Readers\", outlines five phases of the kinesthetic method. With an emphasis on student choice, focal words are generated by the students during the first stage. Each word is introduced by the teacher who writes it on the chalkboard. The student repeats the word while tracing it on the board. When the student is confident that he knows the word, he attempts to write it while saying each syllable. Successful word study is followed by phase two where sentences are created in a similar fashion. The third step incorporates a student-selected book where words from specific paragraphs are isolated for reading. In the fourth phase, the student is asked to read whole phrases from the paragraphs. Finally, the student is encouraged to do silent reading on his own for the fifth phase. After some time all four boys successfully learned to read well enough to perform at grade level. Follow-ups with the participants reflected the maintenance of reading levels and for some avid readers, additional leaps in reading proficiency. Though not asserting widespread generalizability, Fernald and Keller enumerate several findings. One conclusion of interest today describes each student learning by analogy, demonstrating the \"ability to pronounce new words if they resemble words he has already learned.\" This is a compensatory strategy currently used.\nWarren's 1977 dissertation study with children exhibiting mild forms of reading problems demonstrated 147% and 77% superior word recognition and comprehension respectively by Fernald tracing compared to Orton-Gillingham phonics, although O-G was 10% more effective in word decoding.\n\nCareer summary\nOn the eve of Fernald's retirement from the UCLA clinic, Time magazine (July 12, 1948) highlights the story of one boy's reading adventure in Fernald's clinic. The title of the article, \"Reading by Touch\" aptly reflects the Fernald method. Stepping down after 27 years, Fernald sums up the theory behind her \"kinesthetic method\" with the explanation that \"reading difficulties occur most frequently in people who lack the ability to summon up a mental picture of the way a word looks\". Her only requirements for entrance into the clinic program were for students to have average intelligence and for parents to continue with the clinic as long as necessary. According to Time, remediation required from \"two months to two years\" for the students to reach their grade level reading equivalent. Though the article includes some criticism of the Fernald method, in the end it is a positive portrayal of a committed educator.  A clinic at UCLA bears her name to this day.  Critics typically do not follow the tracing directions with fidelity, such making small changes such as orally spelling the individual letters in the word rather than saying/blending the sounds of the word.  Strict adherence to the steps is required for the process to be \"Fernald,\" and any changes interfere with the development of automatic mastery. The Fernald tracing approach to spelling, traditionally speaking, is not oral spelling at all; it is creating the mental visualization of the word for the purpose of correct written spelling and proofing. Oral spelling for students experiencing problems creates interference with acquiring correct visualization.\n\nA child's view of Fernald's method\nA more powerful account of the influence of the kinesthetic method practiced in Fernald's clinic is presented by the International Reading Association\u2019s Special Interest Group in the history of reading. In the spring 1998 edition of the History of Reading News a former student of Fernald's kinesthetic method recalls his experiences in the clinic setting. He describes a typical session with one of the student teachers where there was even finger painting. The student, now an esteemed doctor, researcher, and chair of psychiatry at a major New York hospital, wonders about the \"life changes for some of the other boys as a result of her help and ministrations.\" He admits that he \"still uses aspects of the Fernald method to this day.\"\n\nA parent's view of Fernald's method\nAn additional article written by the mother of the same former student was also included in the 1998 edition of the History of Reading News. Though not as detailed, the passage reminds educators that their work impacts not only the student, but the entire family. The parents contacted Grace Fernald in an effort to support their intelligent second-grade son who was struggling in school. The mother even recounts a visit to Fernald's home. Grace Fernald, the caring teacher, comes alive through these two touching accounts of one boy's success story.\n\nInfluence on education\nUpon Fernald's passing in 1950, her peers praised the tremendous impact of her UCLA clinic endeavors. \"Grace Fernald developed and directed the clinical school. The children and adults helped by study and treatment in this clinic and the teachers and psychologists observing and learning in the clinic school run into the thousands.\"The Fernald Center for Early Care and Education at UCLA is named in her honor.\nFernald's Remedial Techniques in Basic School Subjects was favourably reviewed by J Bald in The Times Educational Supplement, 9.7.1982. The book contains valuable techniques for teaching grammar, arithmetic and foreign languages. It remains one of the most important collections of case study research in its field (the case studies were omitted from the reprinted edition).\nPassage 9:\nAlexander Military Law Academy\nAlexander Military Law Academy (Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e-\u044e\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0430\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u044f) (1867\u20131917) was an educational institution in Russian Empire that provided military law education for officers of Russian Army and Fleet.  It was established in 1867 and named after his founder, Emperor Alexander II of Russia in 1908. The Academy was situated in St. Petersburg by 96 Moika Embankment, along with many other institutions of military education.\nSince 1878 it was reformed into a 3-year higher educational institution, with admittance to any of the three classes, depending on prior education of the admitted. Since 1880 officers from Serbian and Bulgarian Armies were admitted. About 1,000 officers graduated from the academy, as well as a small number or civil officials (which were admitted until 1882).\n\nAcademy History\nIn 1866, by Auditor School, the two-year officers\u2019 courses were established. In 1867, the courses were transformed into a Military Law Academy.\nSince 1908, it received the name of Alexander in honour of Alexander the IIIrd. Officers of all types of military service in the rank up to the captain, who served in the ranks for at least 4 years, were admitted to the academy. Graduates received the right to occupy positions in the military judicial department. Since 1880, Serbian and Bulgarian officers also have studied at the academy. Totally, about 1,000 military lawyers graduated from Academy. It was closed in December 1917 after the unsuccessful Junker mutiny. It was located in Saint Petersburg on the Moika embankment, 96.\n\nExternal links\nAlexander Academy (in Russian)\nPassage 10:\nBrothers of Christian Instruction\nThe Brothers of Christian Instruction (Latin: Institutum Fratrum Instructionis Christianae de Plo\u00ebrmel, F.I.C.P.), commonly known as the La Mennais Brothers, is a Catholic educational organization founded in 1819 by Gabriel Deshayes and Jean-Marie de la Mennais for the instruction of youth. Their aim remains that of their Founder: \"to educate the young and to make Jesus Christ better known and better loved\".The brothers are bound by the simple vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.\n\nHistory\nOn June 16, 1819, Gabriel Deshayes, pastor at Auray and vicar general of Vannes, and Jean-Marie de Lamennais, vicar of Saint-Brieuc, two Catholic priests in France, established the Daughters of Providence and the Brothers of Christian Instruction.\nThe first brothers took their novitiates with the Christian Brothers, whose rule was to a large extent adopted. The organization dedicated itself to promoting education among the working class in France and, eventually, across the world. The motherhouse was established at Plo\u00ebrmel in November 1824. In 1876, the Brothers of Gascony, founded by Bishop de la Croix d\u2019Azolette, then Archbishop of Auch, and in 1880, the Brothers of Sainte-Marie de Tinchebray, founded by Father Charles-Augustin Duguey, subsumed themselves within the Brothers of Plo\u00ebrmel.The Brothers received canonical approval by Pope Leo XIII on March 13, 1891.From the motherhouse at Plo\u00ebrmel, the brothers founded sites in England, Africa, Asia, North America, and Oceania. In 1886 the first brothers arrived in Montreal and were shortly afterwards introduced into the United States. To escape the effects of a 1901 French law curtailing certain kinds of religious schooling, the motherhouse was transferred to Taunton, England. In 1903, following through on the strict secularism of the 1901 law, the French government dissolved the brotherhood's French presence and confiscated its properties. At the same time, they established a presence in Bulgaria, Turkey, and Egypt.The Brothers of Christian Instruction grew, extending their mission to the Philippines and Spain, and expanding it in the United Kingdom. In 2015, 1,300 members of the Brothers of Christian Instruction were spread across 25 countries.\n\nInstitutions\nColl\u00e8ge Jean de la Mennais\nSt. Francis Xavier's College (Liverpool)\nSt. John Fisher Ibanda Secondary School\nSt Mary's Independent School, Southampton\nSt. Mary's International School\nWalsh University\nInstitution Saint-Louis de Gonzague in Delmas, Haiti\nSt. Charles Lwanga Secondary School, Kasasa in Masaka, Uganda\nSt. Henry's College Kitovu in Masaka, Uganda\nSt. Mary's College, Kisubi in Wakiso, Uganda\nSt. Mary's Duluti Secondary School, Arusha\nSeiko Gakuin Junior and Senior High School\n\nSee also\nPell Wall Hall\nCheswardine\nConsecrated life\nPassage 11:\nUnited States Society for Education through Art\nThe United States Society for Education through Art (USSEA) is an American national association whose members work in curriculum development, teaching and research related to art education and cultural differences, and who share interests in art educational content and strategies which promote tolerance and appreciation of the arts of non-mainstream cultural peoples. The mission of the society is to promote greater understanding and respect for learners from all ethnic, minority, and socio-cultural backgrounds through research, art curricula, instruction, and practices that are inclusive and culturally sensitive.The society provides a platform for networking and a resource base for art educators nationally and internationally, who seek to work collaboratively on projects of interest to multicultural or cross-cultural communities and students, publishes instructional resources for classroom teachers, encourages and sponsors cross-cultural research, and facilitates international and intra-national professional relationships through online sites, symposia, conferences, and publications.Each year, USSEA honors one national and one international art educator, each of whom has demonstrated exemplary teaching, service, or research in the area of multicultural or cross-cultural art education with the Ziegfeld Art Education award. The Journal of Cultural Research in Art Education is a publication of USSEA that is made available to all members of the art educational profession. Through the website, members may access suggestions and recommendations for appropriate multi-culturally oriented K-12 art lessons, and receive up-to-date news and information about USSEA initiatives, programs and opportunities. Additionally, exhibitions of children's art from countries around the world are presented at national conferences of art educators and through an online gallery of children's art, which is organized by topical themes and maintained on the USSEA website.\n\nHistory\nUSSEA was founded in 1977 as an affiliate of the International Society for Education Through Art (InSEA) and the National Art Education Association (NAEA). The goals of USSEA reflect, on a national level, the goals of its international parent organization InSEA, which in turn, was inspired by the spirit of postwar hope and optimism of its parent affiliate UNESCO. In a paper describing the early history of InSEA, the motivational energy and overarching goals of UNESCO and InSEA are explained.\n\"The world had just come through a terrible and protracted war, one initiated by false philosophies working on ignorance through massive control of free speech. The impulse in 1945, to try to ensure that it did not happen again, and that people should understand each other better through education and all forms of cultural and scientific exchanges, the passionate emphasis on truth, justice, peace and the importance of the individual \u2013 these impulses were irresistible.\"These sentiments, which gave root to InSEA in 1954, are also guiding principles of USSEA. Art educator Kenneth Marantz was instrumental in establishing the United States organization and served as its first president. Other founding members who served as officers included Maryl Fletcher De Jong, Larry Kantner, Eugenia Oole, Helen Patton, and Tom Sletterhaugh.\n\nSponsored Activities\nAs a means of disseminating shared ideas about the importance of teaching art to increasingly diverse populations and to develop research agenda for determining effective practices of multicultural art education, USSEA began sponsored conferences and symposia. Fourteen such events were held between 1977 and 2010. The topics addressed included \"Limits and Extents of International Research in Art Education\" (1977), \"Art Education: The Pacific Basin\" (1982), \"International Aspects of Teaching Aesthetics and Critical Skills\" (1987), \"Indigenous People, Art, and Place: Interactions of Culture and Environment in Contemporary Life\" (1994) and \"Crossing Cultural, Artistic, and Cyber Borders\" (2000), and \"Youth and Community Development: How the Arts Serve Economically Impoverished Communities\" (2010). The 1991 USSEA Symposium, \"Beyond the Traditional in Art: Facing a Pluralistic Society,\" resulted in the publication of working papers and research agenda that helped focus cultural art educational research and practices during the late 20th and early 21st century.Since 1986, USSEA has presented two annual awards in the name of Edwin Ziegfeld, founding president of InSEA (1954\u20131960) and NAEA (1947\u20131951), to honor an American art educator and a foreign art educator who have made distinguished leadership contributions to international art education. These awards are presented to the recipients during a USSEA Awards banquet held during the annual NAEA conference.The first issue of the USSEA publication The Journal of Multicultural and Cross-cultural Research in Art Education was issued in 1983 with Larry Kantner as senior editor. In 2001, the title of the journal was changed to the Journal of Cultural Research in Art Education (JCRAE). Articles published in JCRAE focus on social/cultural research relevant for art education, including cultural foundations of art education, cross-cultural and multicultural research in art education, and cultural aspects of art in education. These areas may be interpreted in a broad sense to include arts administration, art therapy, community arts organizations, and other disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches relevant to art education. Articles considered for publication may feature theoretical research and research in which qualitative and/or quantitative methods as well as other formats and strategies are employed. In addition to the publication of a journal, USSEA sponsors monographs and sponsors or endorses books that address issues of interest and concern to art educators.",
    "Passage 1:\nLockheed Martin A2100\nThe A2100 is a model of communications satellite spacecraft made by Lockheed Martin Space Systems. It is used as the foundation for telecommunications payloads in geosynchronous orbit, as well as GOES-R weather satellites and GPS Block IIIA satellites. Over 40 satellites use the A2100 bus.\n\nHistory\nThe first satellite, AMC-1, was launched September 8, 1996, and has achieved 15-year on-orbit service life.  Since 1996 there have been over 45 of the A2100 based satellites launched, with over 400 years of total on-orbit service.\nOther A2100 spacecraft include JCSAT-13 and VINASAT-2, which were launched May, 2012 on an Ariane 5 rocket, as well as Arabsat-6A and Hellas Sat 4/SaudiGeoSat-1 of Saudi Arabia's Arabsat-6G program.In 2002, Lockheed Martin Commercial Space Systems was given a Frost and Sullivan Satellite Reliability Award for excellence in the production of flexible and reliable communications satellites used in geosynchronous Earth orbit.A2100 customers includes communications companies around the world, including Astra, Telesat, SKY Perfect JSAT Group and others.\n\nDesign\nThe Lockheed Martin A2100 geosynchronous spacecraft series is designed for a variety of telecommunications needs including Ka band broadband and broadcast services, fixed satellite services in C-band and Ku band payload configurations, high-power direct broadcast services using the Ku band frequency spectrum, and mobile satellite services using UHF, L-band and S-band payloads.The A2100 satellite system was developed by the Astro Space team at its East Windsor, New Jersey facility, with team members delivering a flexible common bus with fewer components, lower spacecraft weight, and reduced customer delivery time.The A2100 is being supplanted by the LM2100, an evolutionary upgrade with several new features. The military version is the LM2100 Combat Bus.\n\nPropulsion system\nThe attitude control system includes reaction wheels, with momentum desaturation and main motor maneuver attitude control propulsion provided by small monopropellant hydrazine motors. This hydrazine supply is contained in a central propellant tank of 0.90 m diameter and up to 2.00 m length depending on the customer's requirements.\nThis tank's maximum length was later increased to 2.55 m.\nThe liquid apogee engine uses hydrazine fuel from the central tank along with nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer from two flanking tanks of 0.54 m diameter and up to 1.65 m long.\nOrbit maintenance is performed by the small hydrazine motors and ion thrusters.\nThe maximum propellant supply (with the largest tanks at 95% fill factor) are 1368 kg of hydrazine fuel and 627 kg of nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer.\nAccording to Moog-ISP, the A2100 platform uses its LEROS bipropellant Liquid Apogee Engine.\n\nSatellite orders\nA2100A\nA2100AX\nA2100AXS\nA2100M (Military)\nLM2100 (Modernized)\nLM2100M (Modernized Military)\nCancelled orders\nPassage 2:\nCommunications satellite\nA communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunication signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth. Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications.  Many communications satellites are in geostationary orbit 22,300 miles (35,900 km) above the equator, so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky; therefore the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track the satellite. Others form satellite constellations in low Earth orbit, where antennas on the ground have to follow the position of the satellites and switch between satellites frequently.\nThe high frequency radio waves used for telecommunications links travel by line of sight and so are obstructed by the curve of the Earth.  The purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the Earth allowing communication between widely separated geographical points.  Communications satellites use a wide range of radio and microwave frequencies. To avoid signal interference, international organizations have regulations for which frequency ranges or \"bands\" certain organizations are allowed to use. This allocation of bands minimizes the risk of signal interference.\n\nHistory\nOrigins\nIn October 1945, Arthur C. Clarke published an article titled \"Extraterrestrial Relays\" in the British magazine Wireless World. The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of artificial satellites in geostationary orbits to relay radio signals. Because of this, Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the inventor of the concept of the communications satellite, and the term 'Clarke Belt' is employed as a description of the orbit.\n\nThe first artificial Earth satellite was Sputnik 1 which was put into orbit by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957. It was developed by Mikhail Tikhonravov and Sergey Korolev, building on work by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. Sputnik 1 was equipped with an on-board radio transmitter that worked on two frequencies of 20.005 and 40.002 MHz, or 7 and 15 meters wavelength. The satellite was not placed in orbit to send data from one point on Earth to another; the radio transmitter was meant to study the properties of radio wave distribution throughout the ionosphere.  The launch of Sputnik 1 was a major step in the exploration of space and rocket development, and marks the beginning of the Space Age.\n\nEarly active and passive satellite experiments\nThere are two major classes of communications satellites, passive and active. Passive satellites only reflect the signal coming from the source, toward the direction of the receiver. With passive satellites, the reflected signal is not amplified at the satellite, and only a very small amount of the transmitted energy actually reaches the receiver.  Since the satellite is so far above Earth, the radio signal is attenuated due to free-space path loss, so the signal received on Earth is very, very weak. Active satellites, on the other hand, amplify the received signal before retransmitting it to the receiver on the ground. Passive satellites were the first communications satellites, but are little used now.\nWork that was begun in the field of electrical intelligence gathering at the United States Naval Research Laboratory in 1951 led to a project named Communication Moon Relay. Military planners had long shown considerable interest in secure and reliable communications lines as a tactical necessity, and the ultimate goal of this project was the creation of the longest communications circuit in human history, with the moon, Earth's natural satellite, acting as a passive relay. After achieving the first transoceanic communication between Washington, D.C., and Hawaii on 23 January 1956, this system was publicly inaugurated and put into formal production in January 1960.\n\nThe first satellite purpose-built to actively relay communications was Project SCORE,  led by Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and launched on 18 December 1958, which used a tape recorder to carry a stored voice message, as well as to receive, store, and retransmit messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The satellite also executed several realtime transmissions before the non-rechargeable batteries failed on 30 December 1958 after eight hours of actual operation.The direct successor to SCORE was another ARPA-led project called Courier. Courier 1B was launched on 4 October 1960 to explore whether it would be possible to establish a global military communications network by using \"delayed repeater\" satellites, which receive and store information until commanded to rebroadcast them. After 17 days, a command system failure ended communications from the satellite.NASA's satellite applications program launched the first artificial satellite used for passive relay communications in Echo 1 on 12 August 1960. Echo 1 was an aluminized balloon satellite acting as a passive reflector of microwave signals. Communication signals were bounced off the satellite from one point on Earth to another. This experiment sought to establish the feasibility of worldwide broadcasts of telephone, radio, and television signals.\n\nMore firsts and further experiments\nTelstar was the first active, direct relay communications commercial satellite and marked the first transatlantic transmission of television signals. Belonging to AT&T as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T, Bell Telephone Laboratories, NASA, the British General Post Office, and the French National PTT (Post Office) to develop satellite communications, it was launched by NASA from Cape Canaveral on 10 July 1962, in the first privately sponsored space launch.Another passive relay experiment primarily intended for military communications purposes was Project West Ford, which was led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory. After an initial failure in 1961, a launch on 9 May 1963 dispersed 350 million copper needle dipoles to create a passive reflecting belt. Even though only about half of the dipoles properly separated from each other, the project was able to successfully experiment and communicate using frequencies in the SHF X band spectrum.An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was the Hughes Aircraft Company's Syncom 2, launched on 26 July 1963. Syncom 2 was the first communications satellite in a geosynchronous orbit. It revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north\u2013south motion, special equipment was needed to track it. Its successor, Syncom 3, launched on 19 July 1964, was the first geostationary communications satellite. Syncom 3 obtained a geosynchronous orbit, without a north\u2013south motion, making it appear from the ground as a stationary object in the sky.A direct extension of the passive experiments of Project West Ford was the Lincoln Experimental Satellite program, also conducted by the Lincoln Laboratory on behalf of the United States Department of Defense. The LES-1 active communications satellite was launched on 11 February 1965 to explore the feasibility of active solid-state X band long-range military communications. A total of nine satellites were launched between 1965 and 1976 as part of this series.\n\nInternational commercial satellite projects\nIn the United States, 1962 saw the creation of the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT) private corporation, which was subject to instruction by the US Government on matters of national policy. Over the next two years, international negotiations led to the Intelsat Agreements, which in turn led to the launch of Intelsat 1, also known as Early Bird, on 6 April 1965, and which was the first commercial communications satellite to be placed in geosynchronous orbit. Subsequent Intelsat launches in the 1960s provided multi-destination service and video, audio, and data service to ships at sea (Intelsat 2 in 1966\u201367), and the completion of a fully global network with Intelsat 3 in 1969\u201370. By the 1980s, with significant expansions in commercial satellite capacity, Intelsat was on its way to become part of the competitive private telecommunications industry, and had started to get competition from the likes of PanAmSat in the United States, which, ironically, was then bought by its archrival in 2005.When Intelsat was launched, the United States was the only launch source outside of the Soviet Union, who did not participate in the Intelsat agreements. The Soviet Union launched its first communications satellite on 23 April 1965 as part of the Molniya program. This program was also unique at the time for its use of what then became known as the Molniya orbit, which describes a highly elliptical orbit, with two high apogees daily over the northern hemisphere. This orbit provides a long dwell time over Russian territory as well as over Canada at higher latitudes than geostationary orbits over the equator.\n\nSatellite orbits\nCommunications satellites usually have one of three primary types of orbit, while other orbital classifications are used to further specify orbital details. MEO and LEO are non-geostationary orbit (NGSO).\n\nGeostationary satellites have a geostationary orbit (GEO), which is 22,236 miles (35,785 km) from Earth's surface. This orbit has the special characteristic that the apparent position of the satellite in the sky when viewed by a ground observer does not change, the satellite appears to \"stand still\" in the sky.  This is because the satellite's orbital period is the same as the rotation rate of the Earth.  The advantage of this orbit is that ground antennas do not have to track the satellite across the sky, they can be fixed to point at the location in the sky the satellite appears.\nMedium Earth orbit (MEO) satellites are closer to Earth. Orbital altitudes range from 2,000 to 36,000 kilometres (1,200 to 22,400 mi) above Earth.\nThe region below medium orbits is referred to as low Earth orbit (LEO), and is about 160 to 2,000 kilometres (99 to 1,243 mi) above Earth.As satellites in MEO and LEO orbit the Earth faster, they do not remain visible in the sky to a fixed point on Earth continually like a geostationary satellite, but appear to a ground observer to cross the sky and \"set\" when they go behind the Earth beyond the visible horizon. Therefore, to provide continuous communications capability with these lower orbits requires a larger number of satellites, so that one of these satellites will always be visible in the sky for transmission of communication signals.  However, due to their closer distance to the Earth, LEO or MEO satellites can communicate to ground with reduced latency and at lower power than would be required from a geosynchronous orbit.\n\nLow Earth orbit (LEO)\nA low Earth orbit (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about 160 to 2,000 kilometres (99 to 1,243 mi) above the earth's surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes.Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, many satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.\nLow-Earth-orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, do not require as high signal strength (signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is considerable). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost.\nIn addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.\n\nSatellite constellation\nA group of satellites working in concert is known as a satellite constellation. Two such constellations, intended to provide satellite phone and low-speed data services, primarily to remote areas, are the Iridium and Globalstar systems. The Iridium system has 66 satellites, which orbital inclination of 86.4\u00b0 and inter-satellite links provide service availability over the entire surface of Earth. Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by SpaceX, that aims for global satellite Internet access coverage.\nIt is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low-Earth-orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part.  This will be the case with the CASCADE system of Canada's CASSIOPE communications satellite. Another system using this store and forward method is Orbcomm.\n\nMedium Earth orbit (MEO)\nA medium Earth orbit is a satellite in orbit somewhere between 2,000 and 35,786 kilometres (1,243 and 22,236 mi) above the earth's surface.  MEO satellites are similar to LEO satellites in functionality. MEO satellites are visible for much longer periods of time than LEO satellites, usually between 2 and 8 hours. MEO satellites have a larger coverage area than LEO satellites. A MEO satellite's longer duration of visibility and wider footprint means fewer satellites are needed in a MEO network than a LEO network. One disadvantage is that a MEO satellite's distance gives it a longer time delay and weaker signal than a LEO satellite, although these limitations are not as severe as those of a GEO satellite.\nLike LEOs, these satellites do not maintain a stationary distance from the earth.  This is in contrast to the geostationary orbit, where satellites are always 35,786 kilometres (22,236 mi) from the earth.\nTypically the orbit of a medium earth orbit satellite is about 16,000 kilometres (10,000 mi) above earth. In various patterns, these satellites make the trip around earth in anywhere from 2 to 8 hours.\n\nExamples of MEO\nIn 1962, the communications satellite, Telstar, was launched. It was a medium earth orbit satellite designed to help facilitate high-speed telephone signals. Although it was the first practical way to transmit signals over the horizon, its major drawback was soon realised. Because its orbital period of about 2.5 hours did not match the Earth's rotational period of 24 hours, continuous coverage was impossible. It was apparent that multiple MEOs needed to be used in order to provide continuous coverage.\nIn 2013, the first four of a constellation of 20 MEO satellites was launched. The O3b satellites provide broadband internet services, in particular to remote locations and maritime and in-flight use, and orbit at an altitude of 8,063 kilometres (5,010 mi)).\n\nGeostationary orbit (GEO)\nTo an observer on Earth, a satellite in a geostationary orbit appears motionless, in a fixed position in the sky.  This is because it revolves around the Earth at Earth's own angular velocity (one revolution per sidereal day, in an equatorial orbit).\nA geostationary orbit is useful for communications because ground antennas can be aimed at the satellite without their having to track the satellite's motion. This is relatively inexpensive.\nIn applications that require many ground antennas, such as DirecTV distribution, the savings in ground equipment can more than outweigh the cost and complexity of placing a satellite into orbit.\n\nExamples of GEO\nThe first geostationary satellite was Syncom 3, launched on 19 August 1964, and used for communication across the Pacific starting with television coverage of the 1964 Summer Olympics. Shortly after Syncom 3, Intelsat I, aka Early Bird, was launched on 6 April 1965 and placed in orbit at 28\u00b0 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the Atlantic Ocean.\nOn 9 November 1972, Canada's first geostationary satellite serving the continent, Anik A1, was launched by Telesat Canada, with the United States following suit with the launch of Westar 1 by Western Union on 13 April 1974.\nOn 30 May 1974, the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be three-axis stabilized was launched: the experimental satellite ATS-6 built for NASA.\nAfter the launches of the Telstar through Westar 1 satellites, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now SES) launched Satcom 1 in 1975.  It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early cable TV channels such as WTBS (now TBS), HBO, CBN (now Freeform) and The Weather Channel become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local cable TV headends using the satellite.  Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like ABC, NBC, and CBS, to distribute programming to their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1 was widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24 transponders as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.By 2000, Hughes Space and Communications (now Boeing Satellite Development Center) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include Space Systems/Loral, Orbital Sciences Corporation with the Star Bus series, Indian Space Research Organisation, Lockheed Martin (owns the former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business), Northrop Grumman, Alcatel Space, now Thales Alenia Space, with the Spacebus series, and Astrium.\n\nMolniya orbit\nGeostationary satellites must operate above the equator and therefore appear lower on the horizon as the receiver gets farther from the equator. This will cause problems for extreme northerly latitudes, affecting connectivity and causing multipath interference (caused by signals reflecting off the ground and into the ground antenna).\nThus, for areas close to the North (and South) Pole, a geostationary satellite may appear below the horizon. Therefore, Molniya orbit satellites have been launched, mainly in Russia, to alleviate this problem.\nMolniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellite's position above the horizon. Thus, a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees.)\nThe Molniya orbit is designed so that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for six to nine hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.\nThe first satellite of the Molniya series was launched on 23 April 1965 and was used for experimental transmission of TV signals from a Moscow uplink station to downlink stations located in Siberia and the Russian Far East, in Norilsk, Khabarovsk, Magadan and Vladivostok. In November 1967 Soviet engineers created a unique system of national TV network of satellite television, called Orbita, that was based on Molniya satellites.\n\nPolar orbit\nIn the United States, the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) was established in 1994 to consolidate the polar satellite operations of\nNASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)\nNOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). NPOESS manages a number of satellites for various purposes; for example, METSAT for meteorological satellite, EUMETSAT for the European branch of the program, and METOP for meteorological operations.\nThese orbits are sun synchronous, meaning that they cross the equator at the same local time each day. For example, the satellites in the NPOESS (civilian) orbit will cross the equator, going from south to north, at times 1:30 P.M., 5:30 P.M., and 9:30 P.M.\n\nBeyond geostationary orbit\nThere are plans and initiatives to bring dedicated communications satellite beyond geostationary orbits.\nNASA proposed LunaNet as a data network aiming to provide a \u201eLunar Internet for cis-lunar spacecraft and Installations.\nThe Moonlight Initiative is an equivalent ESA project that is stated to be compatible and providing navigational services for the lunar surface. Both programmes are satellite constellstions of several satellites in various orbits around the Moon.\nOther orbits are also planned to be used. Positions in the Earth-Moon-Libration points are also proposed for communication satellites covering the Moon alike communication satellites in geosynchronous orbit cover the Earth. Also, dedicated communication satellites in orbits around Mars supporting different missions on surface and other orbits are considered, such as the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter.\n\nStructure\nCommunications Satellites are usually composed of the following subsystems:\n\nCommunication Payload, normally composed of transponders, antennas, and switching systems\nEngines used to bring the satellite to its desired orbit\nA station keeping tracking and stabilization subsystem used to keep the satellite in the right orbit, with its antennas pointed in the right direction, and its power system pointed towards the sun\nPower subsystem, used to power the Satellite systems, normally composed of solar cells, and batteries that maintain power during solar eclipse\nCommand and Control subsystem, which maintains communications with ground control stations. The ground control Earth stations monitor the satellite performance and control its functionality during various phases of its life-cycle.The bandwidth available from a satellite depends upon the number of transponders provided by the satellite. Each service (TV, Voice, Internet, radio) requires a different amount of bandwidth for transmission. This is typically known as link budgeting and a network simulator can be used to arrive at the exact value.\n\nFrequency allocation for satellite systems\nAllocating frequencies to satellite services is a complicated process which requires international coordination and planning. This is carried out under the auspices of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).\nTo facilitate frequency planning, the world is divided into three regions:\n\nRegion 1: Europe, Africa, the Middle East, what was formerly the Soviet Union, and Mongolia\nRegion 2: North and South America and Greenland\nRegion 3: Asia (excluding region 1 areas), Australia, and the southwest PacificWithin these regions, frequency bands are allocated to various satellite services, although a given service may be allocated different frequency bands in different regions. Some of the services provided by satellites are:\n\nFixed satellite service (FSS)\nBroadcasting satellite service (BSS)\nMobile-satellite service\nRadionavigation-satellite service\nMeteorological-satellite service\n\nApplications\nTelephony\nThe first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental long distance telephony. The fixed Public Switched Telephone Network relays telephone calls from land line telephones to an earth station, where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite.  The downlink follows an analogous path.  Improvements in submarine communications cables through the use of fiber-optics caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century.\nSatellite communications are still used in many applications today. Remote islands such as Ascension Island, Saint Helena, Diego Garcia, and Easter Island, where no submarine cables are in service, need satellite telephones. There are also regions of some continents and countries where landline telecommunications are rare to non existent, for example large regions of South America, Africa, Canada, China, Russia, and Australia. Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of Antarctica and Greenland. Other land use for satellite phones are rigs at sea, a backup for hospitals, military, and recreation. Ships at sea, as well as planes, often use satellite phones.Satellite phone systems can be accomplished by a number of means. On a large scale, often there will be a local telephone system in an isolated area with a link to the telephone system in a main land area. There are also services that will patch a radio signal to a telephone system. In this example, almost any type of satellite can be used. Satellite phones connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-Earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite teleport connected to the Public Switched Telephone Network .\n\nTelevision\nAs television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large bandwidth to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats.  Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct broadcast satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS).\nThe definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the Astra, Eutelsat, and Hotbird spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.\nFixed Service Satellites use the C band, and the lower portions of the Ku band. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming, live shots, and backhauls), as well as being used for distance learning by schools and universities, business television (BTV), Videoconferencing, and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to cable television headends.\nFree-to-air satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the Ku band. The Intelsat Americas 5, Galaxy 10R and AMC 3 satellites over North America provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their Ku band transponders.\nThe American Dish Network DBS service has also recently used FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their SuperDish antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the FCC's \"must-carry\" regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry HDTV channels.\nA direct broadcast satellite is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave Ku band. DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented (Direct-To-Home) satellite TV services, such as DirecTV, DISH Network and Orby TV in the United States, Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct in Canada, Freesat and Sky in the UK, Ireland, and New Zealand and DSTV in South Africa.\nOperating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5 m) in diameter for Ku band, and 12 feet (3.6 m) or larger for C band).  They use linear polarization for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to circular polarization used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users do not notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of TVRO (Television Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its Ku band form for the now-defunct Primestar satellite TV service.\nSome satellites have been launched that have transponders in the Ka band, such as DirecTV's SPACEWAY-1 satellite, and Anik F2. NASA and ISRO have also launched experimental satellites carrying Ka band beacons recently.Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (on which the antenna is mounted) is situated.  These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some recreational vehicle owners.  Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by JetBlue Airways for DirecTV (supplied by LiveTV, a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.\n\nRadio broadcasting\nSatellite radio offers audio broadcast services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.\nA satellite radio or subscription radio (SR) is a digital radio signal that is broadcast by a communications satellite, which covers a much wider geographical range than terrestrial radio signals.\n\nAmateur radio\nAmateur radio operators have access to amateur satellites, which have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne repeaters, and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with UHF or VHF radio equipment and highly directional antennas such as Yagis or dish antennas. Due to launch costs, most current amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the X.25 or similar protocols.\n\nInternet access\nAfter the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the Internet via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in remote areas, and cannot access a broadband connection, or require high availability of services.\n\nMilitary\nCommunications satellites are used for military communications applications, such as Global Command and Control Systems. Examples of military systems that use communication satellites are the MILSTAR, the DSCS, and the FLTSATCOM of the United States, NATO satellites, United Kingdom satellites (for instance Skynet), and satellites of the former Soviet Union. India has launched its first Military Communication satellite GSAT-7, its transponders operate in UHF, F, C and Ku band bands. Typically military satellites operate in the UHF, SHF (also known as X-band) or EHF (also known as Ka band) frequency bands.\n\nData collection\nNear-ground in situ environmental monitoring equipment (such as weather stations, weather buoys, and radiosondes), may use satellites for one-way data transmission or two-way telemetry and telecontrol. It may be based on a secondary payload of a weather satellite (as in the case of GOES and METEOSAT and others in the Argos system) or in dedicated satellites (such as SCD). The data rate is typically much lower than in satellite Internet access.\n\nSee also\nPassage 3:\nINSAT-4CR\nINSAT-4CR was a communications satellite operated by ISRO as part of the Indian National Satellite System. Launched in September 2007, it replaced the INSAT-4C satellite which had been lost in a launch failure the previous year. The satellite was initially stationed in geostationary orbit at a longitude of 74 degrees east, with expected operational life of at least ten years, however this may have been reduced by the underperformance of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle which placed it into orbit. INSAT-4CR is planned to be replaced by GSAT-31, which was launched on February 6, 2019.\n\nSpacecraft\nINSAT-4CR was constructed by ISRO, and is based around the I-2K satellite bus. A 2,168-kilogram (4,780 lb) spacecraft, it is equipped with twelve Ku band transponders operating at a frequency of 36 MHz, with 140 Watt travelling wave tube amplifiers. The satellite has an effective isotropic radiated power of 51.5 dBW. An additional Ku band signal is used as a beacon for tracking.\nINSAT-4CR operated in a geostationary orbit at a longitudes of 74\u00b0 East and  48\u00b0 East, providing communications to India. Broadcasting capacity on INSAT-4CR was allocated to Airtel Digital TV and Sun Direct DTH. At launch, the satellite was carrying 1,218 kilograms (2,685 lb) of fuel, for raising itself into geostationary orbit, and subsequently operating there for a planned twelve years. Increased expenditure of fuel reaching geostationary orbit, due to launch underperformance, may have resulted in a loss of up to five years of operational life.\n\nLaunch\nINSAT-4CR was launched on 2 September 2007 by the fifth flight of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle, GSLV-F04. The launch occurred at 12:51 UTC on 2 September 2007. The third stage of the carrier rocket underperformed, resulting in the satellite being placed into a lower than planned orbit.\nAs a result of the underperformance during its launch, INSAT-4CR had to expend maneuvering and station keeping propellant to raise its orbit by more than had originally been planned. It was subsequently reported by Indian news agencies that ISRO had lost track of the satellite's orbit, and could not locate the spacecraft until NASA identified it several days later, however, ISRO denied these claims. As a result of these failures, the operational lifetime of the satellite was reportedly decreased by up to five years.\n\nEnd of life and replacement\nTowards the end of its service life INSAT-4CR was relocated from 74\u00b0E to 48\u00b0E slot on 10 February 2017 where it stayed until being retired and placed into graveyard orbit on 24 November 2020. Services of INSAT-4CR were handed over to GSAT-31.\nPassage 4:\nNOAA-4\nNOAA-4, also known as ITOS-G was a weather satellite operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It was part of a series of satellites called ITOS, or improved TIROS. NOAA-4 was launched on a Delta rocket on November 15, 1974. The launch carried two other satellites: AMSAT-OSCAR 7 and Intasat. It remained operational for 1463 days until it was deactivated by NOAA on November 18, 1978.\nPassage 5:\nFedSat\nFedSat (Australia's 'Federation Satellite'; sometimes FedSat 1; COSPAR 2002-056B, SATCAT 27598) was an Australian scientific research satellite launched from Tanegashima Space Center, Japan by a NASDA H-IIA launch vehicle  on 14 December 2002 (NASDA is now merged with JAXA). The satellite was developed by the Cooperative Research Centre for Satellite Systems, a cooperative made up of several universities, commercial organisations and government bodies. The ground station was at the Institute for Telecommunications Research, part of the University of South Australia, near Adelaide. Since 2005 it was operated by the Australian Department of Defence.\n\nPayloads\nThe satellite had six payloads, as given below:\n\nCommunications Payload: A collection of three components (UHF transponder, Ka-band transponder and base-band processor) used to perform several experiments in satellite communications.\nHigh Performance Computing Experiment: A reconfigurable computer based on a Xilinx XQR4062 FPGA, the first of its kind to be used in space.\nGPS Payload: A Global Positioning System receiver built by NASA. Conceived especially for ionospheric studies between GPS constellation levels and FedSat orbit.\nNewMag Payload: A magnetometer built by the University of Newcastle, Australia, used to take measurements of the Earth's magnetic field near its poles.\nStar Camera: An experimental star camera built by the University of Stellenbosch, used to determine the position of the satellite in space by analysing images of surrounding stars.\nCompact Disk: A nickel \"master\" disk \"cultural time capsule\" with tracks including Paul Kelly's performance of the song he co-wrote with Kev Carmody, \"From Little Things, Big Things Grow\", and recorded statements from several hundred Australian school children about how they imagined a future Australia and its place in the Asia-Pacific.The satellite platform, comprising the structural/thermal components, power system, attitude control system, onboard computer and groundlink, was originally developed in the United Kingdom by Space Innovations Limited. It was later completed along with integration of payloads in Canberra, Australia.\n\nDeclared Dead\nThe spacecraft's battery failed in May 2007 and the mission has been terminated, after lasting 18 months longer than expected.\nPassage 6:\nSICRAL 1B\nSICRAL 1B is a military communications satellite built by Thales Alenia Space for Italian Armed Forces. It is a dual-use spacecraft: Telespazio will use some of the satellite's transmission capacity and some will be used by the Italian defense ministry and NATO. The spacecraft is based on the Italsat 3000 bus and includes one EHF/Ka band, three UHF-band and five active SHF-band transponders. It is designed to be operable for 13 years.\n\nConstruction\nThales Alenia Space was the prime contractor for development and construction of the SICRAL 1B satellite.\n\nLaunch\nOn April 20, 2009 Sea Launch used a Zenit-3SL to carry SICRAL 1B into a geosynchronous transfer orbit. Liftoff from the Ocean Odyssey launch platform took place at 08:16 GMT.\nPassage 7:\nATS-6\nATS-6 (Applications Technology Satellite-6)  was a NASA experimental satellite, built by Fairchild Space and Electronics Division It has been called the world's first educational satellite as well as world's first experimental Direct Broadcast Satellite as part of the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment between NASA and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It was launched May 30, 1974, and decommissioned July 1979. At the time of launch, it was the most powerful telecommunication satellite in orbit. ATS-6 carried no fewer than 23 different experiments, and introduced several breakthroughs. It was the first 3-axis stabilized spacecraft in geostationary orbit. It was also the first to use experimentally with some success electric propulsion in geostationary orbit. It also carried several particle physics experiments, including the first heavy ion detector in geostationary orbit.\nDuring its five-year life, ATS-6 transmitted connection programming to various countries, including India, the United States and other regions. The vehicle also conducted air traffic control tests, was used to practice satellite-assisted search and rescue techniques, carried an experimental radiometer subsequently carried as a standard instrument aboard weather satellites, and pioneered direct broadcast TV.\nATS-6 was a precursor to many technologies still in use today on geostationary spacecraft: large deployable antenna, 3-axis attitude control with slewing capabilities, antenna pointing through RF sensing, electric propulsion, meteorological radiometer in geostationary orbit, and direct to home broadcasting. It is also possible that ATS-6 was a forerunner of the large ELINT satellites such as Mentor.\n\nLaunch\nATS-6 was launched on May 30, 1974, by a Titan III-C launch vehicle. The spacecraft was inserted directly in the geosynchronous orbit. This reduced the on-board fuel requirements to less than 40 kilograms (88 lb) (for a total mass at launch of nearly 1,400 kilograms (3,100 lb)). The highly accurate orbit insertion further lowered the amount of fuel required for final positioning to 9 kilograms (20 lb). This enabled a life extension from the original 2 year to 5 years, even accounting for the premature failure of the electric propulsion subsystem (the station-keeping fuel requirement being around 1.6 kilograms per year (3.5 lb/a)).\n\nStructure, power subsystem and antenna\nOne of the major innovations of ATS-6 was an in-flight deployable antenna of more than 9 metres (30 ft) in diameter. The antenna reflector was furled during launch under the launch vehicle fairing, and was deployed in orbit much like an umbrella. The antenna reflector was built from 48 aluminum ribs, supporting a metallized Dacron mesh. The antenna feeds (in C, S, L, UHF and VHF bands) were placed on the spacecraft body, facing the antenna reflector, and linked to the antenna and the solar panels masts by a carbon-fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) truss. The solar panels were rigidly mounted on two deployable masts. They were of hemi-cylinder shape, thus providing a relatively constant power (595 W beginning of life). Electric power was supplied during eclipses by two Nickel cadmium batteries of 15-A\u00b7h capacity, powering a regulated 30.5-V bus. The satellite dimensions in orbit were 15.8-metre (52 ft) width by 8.2-metre (27 ft) height.\nThis deployable antenna parabola was designed and developed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (LMSC), now Lockheed Martin, under subcontract to Fairchild Aerospace, after several years of small study contracts at LMSC.  The program manager at LMSC was GKC (Colin) Campbell.  The deployment of the reflector was initiated by pyrotechnically operated SQUIB cable cutters.  Deployment time was on the order of 2.5 seconds producing 3,400 newton-metres (2,500 lb\u22c5ft) of torque at the spacecraft interface.  The reflector surface was designed for optimal operation at S-Band frequencies. It weighed 83 kilograms (182 lb) at launch and stowed into a toroidal volume (doughnut shaped) approximately 1.8 metres (6 ft) in diameter and 250 millimetres (10 in) thick.  Three models were fabricated, the STM or structural test model, the F reflector and the G reflector.  The STM was destroyed by Fairchild shortly after the program was finished and the F model was launched with the spacecraft in 1972.  The G model sat unprotected in the Farchild parking lot for several years before it was donated to the Smithsonian.  Bill Wade, the assistant program manager and test manager on the program supported The Smithsonian in the restoration by providing a complete set of drawings and specifications and visited the Silver Hill facility to provide technical guidance.At the time of launch it was the largest parabolic surface launched into orbit.\n\nThree-axis stabilisation\nATS-6 has been the first geostationary satellite with three-axis stabilization and pointing., This subsystem was capable of a highly accurate pointing (better than 0.1\u00b0 through the inertial measurement units, down to 0.002\u00b0 by using a radio-frequency interferometer.). Furthermore, the satellite was able to follow low earth orbit satellites through slewing, by tracking the low earth-orbit satellite through an S-band RF sensing. The system was also able to perform orbitography of the tracked satellite, and was a precursor to the operational system TDRSS.\nThis highly advanced (for the time) pointing subsystem used earth and sun sensors, a star tracker pointed to the pole star, Polaris, and three inertial sensors. The sensor measurements were fed to two digital computers (nominal and redundant), as well to a back-up analog computer. It was also possible to orient the satellite by using radio-frequency sensors.  Actuators were three momentum wheels, and hot gas (hydrazine mono-propellant) thrusters. One of the momentum wheels having failed in July 1975, an alternative scheme was developed, allowing station-keeping with the two remaining wheels and thrusters.\n\nElectric propulsion\nATS-6 was equipped with two electric thrusters based on the acceleration of cesium ions, that were to be used for North-South Station Keeping. This subsystem development followed earlier failed attempts on the previous ATS spacecraft. Each of the thrusters had a mass of 16 kilograms (35 lb), used 150 W of electric power, and produced a thrust of 4 newton-metres (3.0 lbf\u22c5ft), with a specific impulse of 2500s. The on-board supply of cesium would have been sufficient for 4400 hours of thrust. Unfortunately, both thrusters failed prematurely, one after 1 hour of operation, one after 95 hours. However, some of the experiments objectives could be met, such as the measurement of the effective thrust, the absence of any interference with the radio-frequency payloads (from 150 MHz to 6 GHz), no cesium redeposition on the critical parts of the payload (such as the radiometer), and the correct neutralisation of the spacecraft versus its environment.\n\nPayload\nRadiometer\nA radiometer was on board ATS-6, mounted on the earth-facing panel. This instrument was (for the time) of very high resolution. It operated on two channels: infra-red (10.5 to 12.5 \u00b5m) and visible light (0.55 to 0.75 \u00b5m). Images taken with the radiometer covered the whole earth disk, with a resolution of 1,200 lines of 2,400 pixels each (11-kilometre (6.8 mi) square pixel in infra-red, and 5.5-kilometre (3.4 mi) square in visible light). The IR detector was passively cooled at 115K, and the visible light detector maintained at 300K. A complete image of earth's disk was transmitted to ground every 25 minutes. Several hundreds images were taken and transmitted, until a mechanical component of the radiometer failed, two and a half months after launch.\n\nTelecommunication experiments\nThe main mission of ATS-6 was to demonstrate the feasibility of direct-to-home (DTH) television broadcasting. To this end, in addition to the high-gain antenna, the spacecraft payload was able to receive in any of the VHF, C, S and L-bands, and to transmit in S-band (2 GHz) through a 20-W solid state transmitter, in L-band (1650 MHz) at 40W, in UHF (860 MHz) at 80W (which was used for the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE)), and with a TWTA-based transmitter of 20 W in C-band (4 GHz). The antenna produced two spots on earth of 400,000 square kilometres (150,000 sq mi) each, in which the TV broadcast could be received with 3 metres (9.8 ft) diameter antennas. This payload was first used over the United States for tele-education and tele-medicine experiments, from August 1974 to May 1975 as part of the HET, or Health, Education, Telecommunications experiment developed jointly by NASA and the US Department of Health, Education, & Welfare (now DHHS). The spacecraft was then moved over the geo-stationary arc from 94 \u00b0W to 35 \u00b0E, in collaboration with the Indian Space Agency (ISRO), who had deployed in India more than 2500 receive ground stations. The move of the satellite from 94 degrees West to 35 degrees East, a journey of 12,800 kilometres (8,000 mi), was actioned from the ground station at Rosman North Carolina  This relocation involved 2 rocket burns of the onboard rocket motor. The 2nd burn lasting 5 hours 37 minutes and 17 seconds. The longest burn ever done by a chemical rocket in space at that time. A tele-education programme was started \u2013 Satellite Instructional Television Experiment or SITE \u2013 and run for one year. During the experiment, a receive station was offered by the Indian Government to Arthur C. Clarke, who was living in Sri Lanka. This experiment was highly successful, and encouraged ISRO to start building an operational program, with the Indian spacecraft  INSAT IB (launched 1983). After the SITE experiment, the satellite was brought back over the United States, and served notably as a data-relay and tracking satellite for low-orbit spacecraft such as Nimbus 6, and for the Apollo-Soyuz flight.\n\nParticle physics experiments\nSeveral particle physics experiments were on board ATS-6. The most significant measured low energy protons (from 25 keV to 3.6 MeV), as well as detected heavy ions (up to 6 MeV). This latter experiment allowed to detect the first heavy ions (Z > 6) with an energy  E > 4 MeV, in geostationary orbit.\n\nPropagation experiments\nFinally, ATS-6 embarked several radio beacons, which allowed to measure electromagnetic propagation properties of the atmosphere at 13, 18, 20 and 30 GHz.\n\nDecommissioning\nBy June 30, 1979, only one of the four ATS-6 station keeping thrusters was working, and was showing signs of unreliability. This thruster was used to move ATS-6 out of geostationary orbit to an orbit several hundred kilometers higher. This was to vacate the geostationary slot for the next satellite.\n\nSee also\n1974 in spaceflight\nApplications Technology Satellite\nPassage 8:\nOptus\nSingtel Optus Pty Limited (commonly referred to as Optus) is an Australian telecommunications company headquartered in Macquarie Park, a suburb in the Northern Sydney region of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Singaporean telecommunications company Singtel. \nOptus is the second-largest wireless carrier in Australia, with over 10 million subscribers as of 2022, and it's mobile network covers 98.5% of the Australian population.\n\nHistory\nAUSSAT and deregulation (1981\u20131990)\nOptus can trace its beginnings back to the formation of the Government-owned AUSSAT Pty Limited in 1981. In 1982, Aussat selected the Hughes 376 for their initial satellites, with the first, AUSSAT A1, launched in August 1985. AUSSAT satellites were used for both military and civilian satellite communications, and delivering television services to remote outback communities.\n\nWith Aussat operating at a loss and with moves to deregulate telecommunications in Australia, the government decided to sell Aussat, coupled with a telecommunications licence. The licence was sold to Optus Communications \u2013 a consortium including:\nlogistics firm Mayne Nickless (24.99%);\nUK telecommunications company Cable & Wireless (24.50%);\nUS telecommunications company BellSouth (24.50%);\nAIDC Limited (10.00%);\ninsurance and investment company AMP (10.00%); and\ninsurance and investment company National Mutual (6.02%).The new telecommunications company was designed to provide competition to then government owned telecommunications company Telecom Australia, now known as Telstra.\n\nFounding of Optus (1991\u2013present)\nOptus gained the second general carrier licence in January 1991.After privatisation, AUSSAT became Optus and its first offering to the general public was to offer long-distance calls at cheaper rates than that of its competitor Telstra. The long-distance calling rates on offer were initially available by consumers dialing 1 before the area code and phone number. Following this, a ballot process was conducted by then regulator AUSTEL, with customers choosing their default long-distance carrier. Customers who made no choice or did not respond to the mailout campaign automatically remained as a Telstra long-distance customer. Customers who remained with Telstra could dial the override code of 1456 before the area code and phone number to manually select Optus as the carrier for that single call. Since 1 July 1998, consumers have the choice of preselecting their preferred long-distance carrier or dialling the override code before dialling a telephone number.\nThe group began by building an interstate fibre optic cable and a series of exchanges between Optus' interstate network and Telstra's local network. It also laid fibre optics into major office buildings and industrial areas, and focused on high bandwidth local, (interstate) long distance, and interstate calls for business. In its early years, Optus was only able to offer local and long-distance calls to residential customers through Telstra's local phone network. Telstra would carry residential to residential calls to Optus' exchanges, and then the calls would be switched to Optus' long-distance fibre optic network.\nOptus was the main sponsor of the 1997 ARL season.\n\n2022 cyberattack\nAround 22 September 2022, Optus systems sustained a significant cyberattack that resulted in a major data breach of both current and former customers' personal information, including customers\u2019 names, dates of birth, phone numbers and email addresses, with a smaller subset of customers having their street addresses, driving licence details and passport numbers leaked. Optus CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin urged customers to exercise \"heightened awareness\" regarding transactions with their Optus and other accounts. Rosmarin emphasised that passwords were not compromised. The CEO said that the \"worst-case scenario\" regarding the number of customers whose data had been leaked was 9.8 million customers, but believes the actual number to be far lower.On 24 September 2022, Australian news outlets The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Optus was investigating the authenticity of a ransom demand of US$1 million made on a hacking forum. The demand gave Optus one week to pay the ransom in cryptocurrency else the data will be sold for US$300,000 to whoever else wants it.On 6 October, the Australian Federal Police announced the arrest of a 19-year-old man who had allegedly threatened 93 Optus customers by saying that he would use their information leaked in the attack to commit financial crimes, unless they paid AUD $2,000.In response to the cyberattack, the Australian federal government announced emergency regulation on 6 October, in the form of a 12-month amendment to the Telecommunications Regulations 2021 to \"enable telecommunications companies to temporarily share approved government identifier information with regulated financial services entities.\"On 11 October, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner launched an investigation, the aim of which is to explore the company's handling of customers' data.\n\nCorporate affairs\nChief Executive Officer\nKelly Bayer Rosmarin commenced as CEO of Optus and Consumer Australia on 1 April 2020.\nA senior executive, Kelly joined Optus as Deputy CEO on 1 March 2019 following a variety of executive roles including Group Executive, Institutional Banking and Markets at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\nThe hybrid fibre-coax rollout\nThese practices meant that Optus was the largest customer of Telstra. To become competitive Optus would need to lay its own local phone network. To provide a killer application for this, the Australian Federal government sold subscription television licences. Optus, as well as the Seven Network, businessman Kerry Stokes and American cable company Cablevision, formed the Optus Vision consortium. News Corporation and Telstra created the rival Foxtel consortium.\nTelstra's local phone network did not have the capability to deliver Foxtel pay television to consumers in the early 1990s, so Telstra identified a need to create a broadband network to support this new product.\nAs Telstra and Optus could not agree on terms for a joint broadband cable roll out, they laid two competing cable networks, in addition to Telstra's existing copper network, at a combined cost estimated of over A$6bn.\nWhilst Telstra focused on creating a broadband network specifically for broadcast, Optus designed their cable network to provide telephony services in addition to broadcast television.\nOptus is no longer a customer of Telstra's after deciding to move the funding used to lease Telstra's copper network into constructing their hybrid fibre-coaxial network, the first in Australia.\n\nTakeovers\nCable and Wireless with 24.5% stakeholder bought out Bell South's equal 24.5% shareholding in July 1997. The company returned to profitability in 1998 and changed its name to Cable and Wireless Optus Pty Limited. Government relaxation of foreign ownership restrictions paved the way for the company to be floated - with Cable and Wireless increasing its holding to 52.5%) - and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange on 17 November 1998.During 2001, Singtel launched a takeover bid for Cable and Wireless Optus which was ultimately successful and the company became known as Singtel Optus Pty Limited.\nIn May 2004, Optus announced a $226.8 million bid for UEComm. The takeover was approved in July and completed in August.In July 2005, Optus announced it would acquire Alphawest Ltd. for A$25.9 million. The buyout was completed in November 2005 and Alphawest is now an operating division of Optus Business.\nOn 12 January 2006, Optus acquired the remaining 74.15% of Virgin Mobile Australia for U$22.6 m, giving it 100% ownership.\n\nOptusNet\nOptus Communications offered its first business-focused internet products in 1998 under the OptusNet product family, offering in-house developed dial-up and high-speed services. Optus purchased one of Australia's pioneer ISPs, Microplex, in 1998 to provide consumer dial-up internet services. Separate to this, under the Optus Vision brand, a cable broadband arm began as a joint venture with U.S. cable and content provider Excite@Home and was known as Optus@Home from its introduction in 1999 until it was renamed in 2002. ADSL services were offered from February 2004. ADSL2+ services were provided from December 2005.\n\nOPEL Networks\nIn June 2007, joint venture subsidiary OPEL Networks was awarded government funding towards the cost of building a regional broadband network. Optus was to be contracted to build the network on behalf of OPEL.In April 2008, after a change of the Federal Government from the Liberal Party of Australia coalition to the Australian Labor Party, the new government terminated the funding agreement and the project was halted, with its functions to be replaced by the National Broadband Network.\n\nTerria\nOptus is part of a consortium \u2013 now known as Terria \u2013 that in July 2006 announced their intention to make a combined bid to build the proposed National Broadband Network.\n\nProducts and services\nOptus's Customer Solutions and Services (CS&S) organisation is responsible for providing support to Optus Business customers.

These are as follows:\nReef Networks was formed in 1999 to provide an optical fibre link between Brisbane and Cairns in Queensland. Optus gained exclusive access to this link in 2001, ahead of acquiring the organisation in 2005.XYZed was established by Optus in 2000 to provide wholesale business-grade DSL services under an individual brand, but today provides a collection of products only as part of the Optus Wholesale & Satellite division. XYZed established a network of DSLAMs inside Telstra telephone exchanges, utilising Unconditioned Local Loop services to reach end users.\n\nInfrastructure\nOptus' fully owned network infrastructure consists of the following:\n\nNetwork backbone\nExtraTerrestrial Fibre Optic Network\nCairns to Brisbane\nBrisbane to Sydney (fully diverse over two physically separate paths)\nSydney to Melbourne (fully diverse over two physically separate paths, one via Canberra, one via the coast)\nMelbourne to Adelaide\nAdelaide to Perth\nSDH Digital Microwave\nHobart to Launceston\nSatellite\nFleet of geostationary satellites (See Optus fleet of satellites)\nInternational Earth Stations in Sydney and Perth\nNational Earth Stations in Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart and Darwin\nRegional exchanges in Sydney (Rosebery), Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra, Adelaide and Perth.\nTelehousing Data Centres in Melbourne and Sydney\n\nCustomer access network\nHybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) network in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne, providing consumer fixed telephony, cable internet and cable television services.\nCBD optical fibre rings in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Canberra and Wollongong, providing direct access for corporate and government services.\nDSLAMs in certain Telstra local telephone exchanges in all states. Originally only providing business-grade DSL services, newer installations also provide consumer DSL and POTS telephony.OptusNet also provides Cable internet. In August 2010, OptusNet released an upgrade of its HFC network to the DOCSIS 3.0 standard, which enabled customers to access a maximum theoretical downstream bandwidth of 100 Megabits. OptusNet is also one of the few ISPs in Australia to currently provide ADSL2+ via its own DSLAMs, which it also resells to other ISPs.\n\nMobile network\nMobile network equipment is from Nortel, Nokia and Huawei and antennas are sourced from Andrews, RFS, Argus and Kathrein.The Optus network operates on the following bandwidth frequencies across Australia:\n\n3G UMTS 900/2100 MHz\n4G LTE 700 / 1800 / 2100 / 2300 / 2600 MHz network which has been in progressive rollout since 2012. VoLTE is currently being rolled out across Australia. For now, VoLTE is only available in CBD and metro areas in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth and Canberra on selected devices purchased on postpaid contracts. Until VoLTE has been fully rolled out, voice calling is still reliant on the 3G network (and formerly the 2G network until it was terminated).\n5G NR 3500 MHz rollout started in October 2019The 2G GSM 900/1800 MHz network was terminated on 3 April 2017 in Western Australia and Northern Territory. 2G GSM was completely terminated on 1 August 2017 when 2G was disconnected in Victoria, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, Tasmania and South Australia. To remain connected, a device that is capable of running 3G at 900 MHz is now required after 2G was completely disconnected across Australia.\n\nPartly owned infrastructure\nPart-owned network infrastructure includes:\n\n3G mobile network, a joint venture with Vodafone Australia\nSouthern Cross Cable, a fully diverse submarine optical fibre link across the Pacific Ocean between Sydney, New South Wales and California in the United States. The Singtel group owns a 40% interest in Southern Cross Cables Limited. This interest was originally owned by Singtel Optus Pty Limited, before ownership was transferred to parent company Singtel during the March 2006 - June 2006 quarter.\n\nAdvertising and sponsorship\nBetween 1994 and 2005 Optus had the naming rights to the Carlton football clubs original home ground in Princes Park. It was called Optus Oval until the ground was retired by the AFL in 2005  \nIn 2016, Optus signed a 10-year partnership agreement with the Australian Olympic Committee to be the official partner of the Australian Olympic Team and the Australian Paralympic Team until 2026.In 2017, Optus won naming rights to Perth Stadium where it would be known as Optus Stadium. Optus and the Government of Western Australia agreed to a 10-year naming right worth approximately A$50 million.Optus also has a long-term partnership with the Adelaide Crows in the AFL. Optus has been a partner of the Collingwood Magpies in the AFL Women's since 2018.Optus is the current major sponsor for the No. 25 Walkinshaw Andretti United Holden ZB Commodore driven by Chaz Mostert\n\nOutsourcing\nSince 2005, Optus has outsourced some customer service functions to Concentrix and 247.ai, with the outsourcer providing 800 staff operating offshore in India, supplementing Optus' 3,000-plus onshore call centre staff. Some functions have also been supplemented in the Philippines. Optus also uses 24/7 Inc. for telephone & chat based offshore support.\nIn October 2006, Optus announced that it would outsource 100 contracting jobs to another Singtel subsidiary, IT company NCS, in Singapore.\n\nAchievement and Rewards\nSee also\n4G Australia\nInternet in Australia\nNational Broadband Network\nTelecommunications in Australia\nPassage 9:\nTDRS-6\nTDRS-6, known before launch as TDRS-F, is an American communications satellite, of first generation, which is operated by NASA as part of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. It was constructed by TRW, and is based on a custom satellite bus which was used for all seven first generation TDRS satellites.\n\nHistory\nTDRS-F was deployed from Space Shuttle Endeavour during the STS-54 mission in 1993. Endeavour was launched from Launch Complex 39B at the Kennedy Space Center, at 13:59:30 UTC on 13 January 1993. TDRS-F was deployed from Endeavour around six hours after launch, and was raised to geosynchronous orbit by means of an Inertial Upper Stage.\n\nDeployment\nThe two-stage solid-propellent Inertial Upper Stage made two burns. The first stage burn occurred shortly after deployment from Endeavour, and placed the satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). At 02:26 UTC on 14 January 1993, it reached apogee, and the second stage fired, placing TDRS-F into geosynchronous orbit. At this point, it received its operational designation, TDRS-6.\n\nOperation\nIn 1994, it was placed at a longitude 46.0\u00b0 West of the Greenwich Meridian, to serve as an on-orbit spare. In 1996, it was moved to 47.0\u00b0 West, where it remained until 2005, when it was repositioned to 174.0\u00b0 West, where, as of August 2009, it was used to provide communications with spacecraft in Earth orbit, such as the International Space Station (ISS) and spacecraft bringing astronauts to the ISS.\n\nSee also\nList of TDRS satellites\nPassage 10:\nHans K. Ziegler\nHans K. Ziegler (March 1, 1911, Munich, Germany \u2013 December 11, 1999 Colts Neck Township, New Jersey, United States) was a pioneer in the field of communication satellites and the use of photovoltaic solar cells as a power source for satellites.\n\nLife\nHans Ziegler was born in Munich, Germany. There, he studied at the Technische Hochschule, which is today the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (TUM), and began his career as Wissenschaftlicher Assistant (Scientific Assistant). Following that, he was a researcher in German industry for ten years. During the Second World War, he worked for the company Rosental Selb in Bavaria on high tension porcelain.\nIn 1947, he came to the US with Wernher von Braun under Operation Paperclip, by means of which the USA gained Nazi engineers and scientists. He went to the US Army Signal Corps' Laboratories in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and became a US citizen in 1954.\nZiegler's work in the US was very influential in the development of military electronics, especially in the electronics for the early phases of the US space program. During the thirty years he worked as an engineer in the field of electronics and electrical engineering in the research and development department of the U.S. Army in Fort Monmouth, N.J. (from 1947 to 1976), he held the top position of Chief Scientist for 12 years. In Fort Monmouth, he worked as a Scientific Consultant, Assistant Director of Research, Director of the Astro-Electronics Division and Chief Scientist (1959). After the Army was restructured, he became Deputy for Science and Chief Scientist of the US Army Electronics Command in 1963 and Director of the US Army Electronics Technology & Devices Laboratory from 1971 until his retirement.\nIn May 1954, after examining the solar cells of Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller and Gerald Pearson at Bell Laboratories, Ziegler wrote, \"Future development [of the silicon solar cell] may well render it into an important source of electrical power [as] the roofs of all our buildings in cities and towns equipped with solar [cells] would be sufficient to produce this country's entire demand for electrical power.\"Referring to silicon solar cells, he said to the head of the U. S. Signal Corps, General James O'Connell, at a meeting in September 1955, \"In fact, in the long run, mankind has no choice but to turn to the sun if it wants to survive.\"He and his team produced a report on the prospects for application of this technique in the field of communication and they named the supply of energy for artificial satellites as the most important application. He knew that he was not the first to suggest this application. For example, the science fiction author, Arthur C. Clarke had already made this suggestion in 1945, but without having a concrete technology for it at that time.\nZiegler participated in the development of the first planned satellites. The first satellite,\nExplorer 1, still went into space without solar cells, since it was a quick, less-than-ideal solution after the start of the Sputnik to show the American public that America's scientists could also start a satellite. The actual scheduled satellite project, Project Vanguard, successfully put a satellite named Vanguard I in orbit around Earth on March 17, 1958.\nOver the objections of the Navy, which still thought that solar cells were not a mature technology, this satellite had four solar cells on its outer hull, due to the persistent work of Ziegler, which powered the instruments and performed their duties reliably for more than seven years. After this success, solar cells were established as the energy supply for satellites. He was also involved with the development of the first communication satellite in the world, SCORE, which was started in 1958.\nHe was awarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award by the US Department of Defense in 1963 as a \" world pioneer in communications satellites and solar energy systems to power satellites\". When he retired in 1977, he was decorated with the highest award of the Army for \"exceptional civilian service\".\nZiegler was the author of many technical papers, a member of the IEEE, and represented the US, in military and civilian matters, in many national and international committees. In 1958, he was a member of the US delegation to the International Geophysical Year in Moscow, USSR, and in 1964, he gave advice on the scientific activities in Antarctica and at the South Pole, under the direction of the US National Science Foundation.\nZiegler's wife Friederike died in 1996. He last lived in Colts Neck Township, New Jersey and died at the age of 88 on December 11, 1999. He was survived by his daughters, Christine Griffith and Friederike Meindl, and his son, Hans.\n\nSee also\nSolar power\nSolar panel\nActive solar\nPhotovoltaic components, projects and howtos",
    "Passage 1:\nWaldrada of Lotharingia\nWaldrada was the mistress, and later the wife, of Lothair II of Lotharingia.\n\nBiography\nWaldrada's family origin is uncertain. The prolific 19th-century French writer Baron Ernouf suggested that Waldrada was of noble Gallo-Roman descent, sister of Thietgaud, the bishop of Trier, and niece of Gunther, archbishop of Cologne. However, these suggestions are not supported by any evidence, and more recent studies have instead suggested she was of relatively undistinguished social origins, though still from an aristocratic milieu.\nThe Vita Sancti Deicoli states that Waldrada was related to Eberhard II, Count of Nordgau (included Strasbourg) and the family of Etichonids, though this is a late 10th-century source and so may not be entirely reliable on this question.In 855 the Carolingian king Lothar II married Teutberga, a Carolingian aristocrat and the daughter of Bosonid Boso the Elder. The marriage was arranged by Lothar's father Lothar I for political reasons. It is very probable that Waldrada was already Lothar II's mistress at this time.Teutberga was allegedly not capable of bearing children and Lothar's reign was chiefly occupied by his efforts to obtain an annulment of their marriage, and his relations with his uncles Charles the Bald and Louis the German were influenced by his desire to obtain their support for this endeavour. Lothair, whose desire for annulment was arguably prompted by his affection for Waldrada, put away Teutberga. However, Hucbert took up arms on his sister's behalf, and after she had submitted successfully to the ordeal of water, Lothair was compelled to restore her in 858. Still pursuing his purpose, he won the support of his brother, Emperor Louis II, by a cession of lands and obtained the consent of the local clergy to the annulment and to his marriage with Waldrada, which took place in 862. However, Pope Nicholas I was suspicious of this and sent legates to investigate at the Council of Metz in 863. The Council found in favour of Lothair's divorce, which led to rumours that the papal legates may have bribed and thus meant that Nicholas order Lothair to take Teutberga back or face excommunication. \nWith the support of Charles the Bald and Louis the German, Teutberga appealed the annulment to Pope Nicholas. Nicholas refused to recognize the annulment and excommunicated Waldrada in 866, forcing Lothair to abandon Waldrada in favour of Teutberga. Lothair accepted this begrudgingly for a time, but shortly afterward at the end of 867 Pope Nicholas I died. Thus, Lothair began to seek the permission of the newly appointed Pope Adrian II to again put Teutberga aside and marry Waldrada, riding to Rome to speak with him on the matter in 869. However, on his way home, Lothair died.\n\nChildren\nWaldrada and Lothair II had some sons and probably three daughters, all of whom were declared illegitimate:\n\nHugh (c. 855\u2013895), Duke of Alsace (867\u2013885)\nGisela (c. 865\u2013908), who in 883 married Godfrey, the Viking leader ruling in Frisia, who was murdered in 885\nBertha (c. 863\u2013925), who married Theobald of Arles (c. 854\u2013895), count of Arles, nephew of Teutberga. They had two sons, Hugh of Italy and Boso of Tuscany. After Theobald's death, between 895 and 898 she married Adalbert II of Tuscany (c. 875\u2013915) They had at least three children: Guy, who succeeded his father as count and duke of Lucca and margrave of Tuscany, Lambert succeeded his brother in 929, but lost the titles in 931 to his half-brother Boso of Tuscany, and Ermengard.\nErmengarde (d. 90?)\nOdo (d. c.879)\nPassage 2:\nFrancis I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi\nFrancis I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi (February 24, 1645, Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, Transylvania \u2013 July 8, 1676, Zbor\u00f3, Royal Hungary) was a Hungarian aristocrat, elected prince of Transylvania and father of Hungarian national hero Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II.Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi was the son of George R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II, prince of Transylvania, and Sophia B\u00e1thory. He was elected prince by the Transylvanian Diet in 1652, during his father's life. However, because of the disastrous Polish campaign of 1657 and its consequences, the Ottoman Empire removed his father from the throne in 1660, and prohibited any R\u00e1k\u00f3czi to ascend the Transylvanian throne. This left Francis unable to come by his father's legacy; he therefore withdrew to his estates in Royal Hungary.\nNotably, the R\u00e1k\u00f3czi family was Calvinist, and they were staunch supporters of the Reformed Church in Hungary. However, Francis' mother, Sophia B\u00e1thory, had converted to Calvinism merely for the sake of her marriage. After her husband's death, she returned to Catholicism and supported the Counter Reformation. Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi also became a Catholic, thus acquiring favour with the Catholic Habsburg Court. His mother converted him to Catholicism. He was made a count in 1664.\nIn 1666 Francis married Jelena Zrinska (Hungarian: Zr\u00ednyi Ilona), a Croatian countess, and joined the Wessel\u00e9nyi conspiracy (Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy in Croatia), one leader of which was Jelena's father, Petar Zrinski (Hungarian: Zr\u00ednyi P\u00e9ter). Francis soon became the leader of the conspiracy, and, as a culmination of their anti-Habsburg stratagems, started an armed uprising of nobles in Upper Hungary, while the other conspirators were supposed to start the fight in Croatia. Due to poor organization and discord between the conspirators, however, the Austrian authorities were well informed; they quickly suppressed the Croatian branch of the revolt.\nWhen R\u00e1k\u00f3czi learned that Petar Zrinski had been captured by the Austrians, he laid down his arms and applied for mercy. All other leaders of the conspiracy were executed for high treason; R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, due to his mother's intervention, and for a ransom of 300,000 forints and several castles, was pardoned.\n\nIssue\nFrancis I had three  children:\n\nGy\u00f6rgy (1667)\nJulianna Borb\u00e1la (1672\u20131717), married Count Ferdinand Gobert von Aspremont-Lynden (1643-1708)\nFrancis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II (1676\u20131735)Francis II was born only three months before his father's death. He led a rebellion against Austrian rule (R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence) and died in exile.\nPassage 3:\nMary Fiennes (lady-in-waiting)\nMary Fiennes (1495\u20131531) was an English courtier. She was the wife of Henry Norris. Norris was executed for treason as one of the alleged lovers of her cousin, Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII of England. Mary lived for six years at the French court as a Maid of Honour to queens consort Mary Tudor, wife of Louis XII; and Claude of France, wife of Francis I.\n\nFamily and early years\nMary was born at Herstmonceux Castle in Sussex in 1495, the only daughter of Thomas Fiennes, 8th Baron Dacre and Anne Bourchier. By both her father and mother she was descended from Edward III. She had two younger brothers, Sir Thomas and John. Her mother was an elder half-sister of Elizabeth Howard and Lord Edmund Howard, making queen consorts Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard a cousin of Mary. Her paternal grandmother, Alice FitzHugh, was sister to Elizabeth FitzHugh, grandmother of Catherine Parr, making her cousin to yet another queen consort of Henry VIII.\nIn 1514, Mary was appointed a Maid of Honour to Princess Mary Tudor and accompanied her to France when the latter married King Louis XII of France; afterwards she served in the capacity to Queen Mary's successor, Queen Claude, consort of the new king Francis I of France. Among her fellow Maids of Honour were her cousins, Mary (a mistress of Henry VIII) and Anne Boleyn.\n\nMarriage and issue\nIn 1520 upon her return to England, she married the courtier, Henry Norreys (1491 \u2013 17 May 1536) of Yattendon in Berkshire, whom she had met that same year at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in France.\nNorris served King Henry VIII of England as a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, and was held in high favour by the King. He was later appointed Groom of the Stool and continued to enjoy the King's favour. According to biographer Eric Ives, Norris was \"perhaps the nearest thing Henry had to a friend.\" Norris had control of King Henry's Privy chamber.\nHenry and Mary had three children:\nEdward Norris (died 1529)\nHenry Norris, 1st Baron Norreys (c.\u20091525 \u2013 1601), married Margaret Williams of Rycote, by whom he had issue.\nMary Norris, married firstly Sir George Carew, and secondly Sir Arthur Champernowne, by whom she had issue.\n\nDeath\nMary died in 1531, a year after her mother. Five years later her husband was attainted and executed for treason as one of the five alleged lovers of her cousin Queen Anne Boleyn, who herself was beheaded at the Tower of London on 19 May 1536.\nTheir four orphaned children were raised by Norris's brother Sir John Norris.\n\nAncestry\nPassage 4:\nAgatha (wife of Samuel of Bulgaria)\nAgatha (Bulgarian: \u0410\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430, Greek: \u0386\u03b3\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7; fl.\u2009late 10th century) was the wife of Emperor Samuel of Bulgaria.\n\nBiography\nAccording to a later addition to the history of the late-11th-century Byzantine historian John Skylitzes, Agatha was a captive from Larissa, and the daughter of the magnate of Dyrrhachium, John Chryselios. Skylitzes explicitly refers to her as the mother of Samuel's heir Gavril Radomir, which means that she was probably Samuel's wife. On the other hand, Skylitzes later mentions that Gavril Radomir himself also took a beautiful captive, named Irene, from Larissa as his wife. According to the editors of the Prosopographie der mittelbyzantinischen Zeit, this may have been a source of confusion for a later copyist, and Agatha's real origin was not Larissa, but Dyrrhachium. According to the same work, it is likely that she had died by ca. 998, when her father surrendered Dyrrhachium to the Byzantine emperor Basil II.Only two of Samuel's and Agatha's children are definitely known by name: Gavril Radomir and Miroslava. Two further, unnamed, daughters are mentioned in 1018, while Samuel is also recorded as having had a bastard son.Agatha is one of the central characters in Dimitar Talev's novel Samuil.\nPassage 5:\nEmpress Sh\u014dken\nEmpress Dowager Sh\u014dken (\u662d\u61b2\u7687\u592a\u540e, Sh\u014dken-k\u014dtaig\u014d, 9 May 1849 \u2013 9 April 1914), born Masako Ichij\u014d (\u4e00\u6761\u52dd\u5b50, Ichij\u014d Masako), was the wife of Emperor Meiji of Japan. She is also known under the technically incorrect name Empress Sh\u014dken (\u662d\u61b2\u7687\u540e, Sh\u014dken-k\u014dg\u014d). She was one of the founders of the Japanese Red Cross Society, whose charity work was known throughout the First Sino-Japanese War.\n\nEarly life\nLady Masako Ichij\u014d was born on 9 May 1849, in Heian-ky\u014d, Japan. She was the third daughter of Tadayoshi Ichij\u014d, former Minister of the Left and head of the Fujiwara clan's Ichij\u014d branch. Her adoptive mother was one of Prince Fushimi Kuniie's daughters, but her biological mother was Tamiko Niihata, the daughter of a doctor from the Ichij\u014d family. Unusually for the time, she had been vaccinated against smallpox. As a child, Masako was somewhat of a prodigy: she was able to read poetry from the Kokin Wakash\u016b by the age of 4 and had composed some waka verses of her own by the age of 5. By age seven, she was able to read some texts in classical Chinese with some assistance and was studying Japanese calligraphy. By the age of 12, she had studied the koto and was fond of Noh drama. She excelled in the studies of finances, ikebana and Japanese tea ceremony.The major obstacle to Lady Masako's eligibility to become empress consort was the fact that she was 3 years older than Emperor Meiji, but this issue was resolved by changing her official birth date from 1849 to 1850. They became engaged on 2 September 1867, when she adopted the given name Haruko (\u7f8e\u5b50), which was intended to reflect her \nserene beauty and diminutive size.\nThe Tokugawa Bakufu promised 15,000 ry\u014d in gold for the wedding and assigned her an annual income of 500 koku, but as the Meiji Restoration occurred before the wedding could be completed, the promised amounts were never delivered. The wedding was delayed partly due to periods of mourning for Emperor K\u014dmei,  for her brother Saneyoshi, and the political disturbances around Kyoto between 1867 and 1868.\n\nEmpress of Japan\nLady Haruko and Emperor Meiji's wedding was finally officially celebrated on 11 January 1869. She was the first imperial consort to receive the title of both ny\u014dg\u014d and of k\u014dg\u014d (literally, the emperor's wife, translated as \"empress consort\"), in several hundred years. However, it soon became clear that she was unable to bear children. Emperor Meiji already had 12 children by 5 concubines, though: as custom in Japanese monarchy, Empress Haruko adopted Yoshihito, her husband's eldest son by Lady Yanagihara Naruko, who became Crown Prince. On 8 November 1869, the Imperial House departed from Kyoto for the new capital of Tokyo. In a break from tradition, Emperor Meiji insisted that the Empress and the senior ladies-in-waiting should attend the educational lectures given to the Emperor on a regular basis about national conditions and developments in foreign nations.\n\nInfluence\nOn 30 July 1886, Empress Haruko attended the Peeresses School's graduation ceremony in Western clothing. On 10 August, the imperial couple received foreign guests in Western clothing for the first time when hosting a Western Music concert.From this point onward, the Empress' entourage wore only Western-style clothes in public, to the point that in January 1887 \nEmpress Haruko issued a memorandum on the subject: traditional Japanese dress was not only unsuited to modern life, but Western-style dress was closer than the kimono to clothes worn by Japanese women in ancient times.In the diplomatic field, Empress Haruko hosted the wife of former US President Ulysses S. Grant during his visit to Japan. She was also present for her husband's meetings with Hawaiian King Kal\u0101kaua in 1881. Later that same year, she helped host the visit of the sons of future British King Edward VII: Princes Albert Victor and George (future George V), who presented her with a pair of pet wallabies from Australia.On  26 November 1886, Empress Haruko accompanied her husband to Yokosuka, Kanagawa to observe the new Imperial Japanese Navy cruisers Naniwa and Takachiho firing torpedoes and performing other maneuvers. From 1887, the Empress was often at the Emperor's side in official visits to army maneuvers. When Emperor Meiji fell ill in 1888, Empress Haruko took his place in welcoming envoys from Siam, launching warships and visiting Tokyo Imperial University. In 1889, Empress Haruko accompanied Emperor Meiji on his official visit to Nagoya and Kyoto. While he continued on to visit naval bases at Kure and Sasebo, she went to Nara to worship at the principal Shinto shrines.Known throughout her tenure for her support of charity work and women's education during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u201395), Empress Haruko worked for the establishment of the Japanese Red Cross Society. She participated in the organization's administration, especially in their peacetime activities in which she created a money fund for the International Red Cross. Renamed \"The Empress Sh\u014dken Fund\", it is presently used for international welfare activities. After Emperor Meiji moved his military headquarters from Tokyo to Hiroshima to be closer to the lines of communications with his troops, Empress Haruko joined her husband in March 1895. While in Hiroshima, she insisted on visiting hospitals full of wounded soldiers every other day of her stay.\n\nDeath\nAfter Emperor Meiji's death in 1912, Empress Haruko was granted the title Empress Dowager (\u7687\u592a\u540e, K\u014dtaig\u014d) by her adoptive son, Emperor Taish\u014d. She died in 1914 at the Imperial Villa in Numazu, Shizuoka and was buried in the East Mound of the Fushimi Momoyama Ryo in Fushimi, Kyoto, next to her husband. Her soul was enshrined in Meiji Shrine in Tokyo. On 9 May 1914, she received the posthumous name Sh\u014dken K\u014dtaig\u014d (\u662d\u61b2\u7687\u592a\u540e).

Her name has also been spelled Euries or Euryes or Eunoa.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nEuno\u00eb Maura was thought to be descended from Berbers, but her name is Greek so it appears she might have been from there or had Greek ancestry. She was likely of very high status, as she is mentioned by historian Suetonius in the same context as Cleopatra.\n\nMarriage\nAt an unspecified early date in her marriage to her husband Bogud he mounted an expedition along the Atlantic coast, seemingly venturing into the tropics. When he returned he presented his wife Euno\u00eb with gigantic reeds and asparagus he had found on the journey.She is believed to have been a mistress of Julius Caesar. She may have replaced Cleopatra in Caesar's affections, when he arrived in North Africa prior to the Battle of Thapsus on 6 April 46 BC, the two were among several queens courted by Caesar. It is also possible that they first met in Spain if she accompanied her husband there on a campaign. Only a brief romance for the Roman, both Eunoe and Bogudes profited through gifts bestowed on them by Caesar. Caesar departed from Africa in June 46 BC, five and a half months after he landed.\n\nCultural depictions\nEuno\u00eb and Caesar's affair is greatly exaggerated and expanded on in the Medieval French prose work Faits des Romains. Jeanette Beer in her book A Medieval Caesar states that the Roman general is \"transformed into Caesar, the medieval chevalier\" in the text, and that the author is more interested in Caesar's sexual dominance over the queen than the political dominance he held over her husband Bogud. The text describes her; \"Eunoe was the most beautiful woman in four kingdoms \u2014 nevertheless, she was Moorish\", which Beer further analysed as being indicative of the fact that it was unimaginable to audiences of the time to believe that a lover of Caesar could be ugly, but that Moors still represented everything that was ugly to them.Euno\u00eb has also been depicted in several novels about Caesar, as well as serialized stories in The Cornhill Magazine. In such fiction her character often serves as a foil for the relationship between Caesar and another woman, mostly Cleopatra, such as in The Memoirs of Cleopatra, The Bloodied Toga and When We Were Gods. In Song of the Nile she also plays a posthumous role as a person of interest for Cleopatra's daughter Selene II who became queen of Mauritania after her.Eunoe has also been depicted in a numismatic drawing by Italian artist and polymath Jacopo Strada, who lived in the 16th century. There is however no archaeological evidence of a coin that bears her name or picture.\n\nSee also\nWomen in ancient Rome\nPassage 7:\nCatherine Exley\nCatherine Exley (1779\u20131857) was an English diarist. She was the wife of a soldier who accompanied her husband when he served in Portugal, Spain, and Ireland during the Napoleonic Wars. Exley is best known as the author of a diary that gives an account of military life in that era from the viewpoint of the wife of a common soldier.\n\nBackground\nCatherine Whitaker was born at Leeds in 1779 and married Joshua Exley there in 1806. Between  1805 and 1815, Joshua served in the Second Battalion of the 34th Regiment of Foot, initially as a private and then for a little over two years, as a corporal. Exley accompanied her husband for a substantial portion of this time and in due course wrote an account that is probably unique in that it records and reflects on life in the British Army from the perspective of the wife of a soldier who did not reach the rank of an officer.\n\nThe diary\nCatherine's diary was first published as a booklet issued shortly after her death. A single copy of the booklet is known to exist, it was also reprinted in The Dewsbury Reporter during August 1923. The text of the diary is included in full in a more recently issued book, edited by Professor Rebecca Probert, along with essays on its military and religious context, the treatment of prisoners of war and the role of women in the British, French and Spanish armed forces during the Peninsular War.\nThe diary unfolds the hardships that both Catherine and her husband suffered during his military service, including one period when they both wrongly thought that the other had died. There are detailed accounts of the births and deaths of children, the cold, hunger and filthy conditions of military life and the horror of the aftermaths of battles. Details of the author's religious experiences which led her to membership of the Methodist church also appear. Exley wrote the diary during the last 20 years before her death, which took place in 1857 at Batley, Yorkshire.\nPassage 8:\nIlona Zr\u00ednyi\nCountess Ilona Zr\u00ednyi (Croatian: Jelena Zrinska, Hungarian: Zr\u00ednyi Ilona) (1643, Ozalj \u2013 18 February 1703, Izmit) was a noblewoman and heroine. She was one of the last surviving members of the Croatian-Hungarian Zrinski/Zr\u00ednyi noble family. She was the daughter of Petar Zrinski, Ban (viceroy) of Croatia, the niece of both Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi and Fran Krsto Frankopan and the wife of Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi I and Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly, as well as the mother of Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II. She is remembered in history for her Defense of Palanok Castle against the Imperial army in 1685-1688, an act for which she was regarded a heroine in Hungary.\n\nLife\nEarly years and family\nIlona was born Ilona Zr\u00ednyi in Ozalj, present day Croatia. She was the eldest child of Croatian Ban, Peter Zrinyi, and his wife Katarina Zrinyi n\u00e9e Frankopan, a Croatian poet. Later her parents had two daughters, Judita Petronila (1652-1699), and Aurora Veronika (1658-1735), as well as a son, Ivan Antun (1651-1703). Ilona and her siblings were the last generation of descendants of the once-powerful Zrinski family.\nFrom her childhood, she was known for her beauty and good education. There is little information on her schooling; it is known though that she acquired a high level of knowledge within her family, not only from her father and mother, Croatian writers and erudite persons but from her uncle Nikola VII Zrinski as well.\n\nMarriages\nOn 1 March 1666, she married Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, with whom she had three children: Gy\u00f6rgy, born in 1667, who died in infancy; Julianna, born in 1672; and Ferenc (commonly known as Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II), born in 1676. On June 8, 1676, not long after Francis II's birth, the elder Francis died. The widowed Ilona requested guardianship of her children and was granted it, against the advice of Emperor Leopold I's advisers and against Francis I's will. In this way she also retained control over the vast R\u00e1k\u00f3czi estates, which included among them the castles of Reg\u00e9c, S\u00e1rospatak, Makovica, and Munk\u00e1cs. In 1682 she married Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly and became an active partner in her second husband's Kuruc uprising against the Habsburgs.\n\nDefense of Munk\u00e1cs (Palanok) Castle\nAfter their defeat at the 1683 Battle of Vienna, both the Ottoman forces and Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly's allied Kuruc fighters had no choice but to retreat, and Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly quickly lost one R\u00e1k\u00f3czi castle after another. At the end of 1685, the Imperial army surrounded the last remaining stronghold, Munkacs Castle in today's Ukraine. Ilona Zr\u00ednyi alone defended the castle for three years (1685\u20131688) against the forces of General Antonio Caraffa.\n\nInternment, exile and death\nAfter the recapture of Buda, the situation became untenable, and on 17 January 1688, Ilona had no choice but to surrender the castle, with the understanding that the defenders would receive amnesty from the Emperor, and that the R\u00e1k\u00f3czi estates would remain in her children's name. Under this agreement, she and her children traveled immediately to Vienna, where in violation of the pact the children were taken from her. Ilona lived until 1691 in the convent of the Ursulines, where her daughter Julianna was also raised. Her son Francis was immediately taken to the Jesuit school in Neuhaus.\nAt the time, her husband, Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly, was still fighting with his Kuruc rebels against the Habsburg army in Upper Hungary. When Habsburg General Heisler was captured by Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly, a prisoner exchange was arranged, and Ilona joined her husband in Transylvania. In 1699, however, after the Treaty of Karlowitz was signed, both spouses, having found themselves on the losing side, had to go into exile in the Ottoman Empire. The countess lived in Galata, district of Constantinople, and later in Izmit, where she died on 18 February 1703. She was buried in the French church of Saint Benoit in Galata.\n\nDescendants\nFrom her first marriage with Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, Ilona had three children:\n\nGy\u00f6rgy (1667\u20131667)\nJulianna Borb\u00e1la (September 1672 \u2013 1717); married Count Ferdinand Gobert von Aspremont-Lynden (1643-1708)\nFrancis II (27 March 1676 \u2013 8 April 1735)From her second marriage with Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly, Ilona had three children, all of whom died at a young age (including one she was pregnant with during the siege of Munk\u00e1cs).\n\nLegacy\nIlona Zr\u00ednyi is celebrated in Croatia and Hungary as one of the greatest national heroines, patriots and fighters for freedom, who opposed, although unsuccessfully, the autocracy and absolutism aspirations of the Habsburgs. Her even more famous son Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi continued the struggle for the independence of Hungary (1703\u20131711).\nIn October 1906 the remains of the Croatian countess were reinterred with her son's in the St Elisabeth Cathedral in present-day Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia.\n\nHonors\nPostage stamp issued by Hungary on 28 September 1952.\n\nSee also\nHouse of Zrinski\nZrinski family tree\nZrinski\u2013Frankopan conspiracy\nKuruc\nR\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War for Independence\nWessel\u00e9nyi conspiracy\nPassage 9:\nArtaynte\nArtaynte (f. 478 BC), was the wife of the Crown Prince Darius.\n\nLife\nDaughter of an unnamed woman and Prince Masistes, a marshall of the armies during the invasion of Greece in 480-479 BC, and the brother of King Xerxes I.\nDuring the Greek campaign Xerxes developed a passionate desire for the wife of Masistes, but she would constantly resist and would not bend to his will. Upon his return to Sardis, the king endeavoured to bring about the marriage of his son Daris to Artaynte, the daughter of this woman the wife of Masistes, supposing that by doing so he could obtain her more easily.\nAfter moving to Susa he brought Artaynte to the royal house with him for his son Daris, but fell in love with her himself, and after obtaining her they became lovers. \nAt the behest of Xerxes, Artaynte committed adultery with him (Xerxes). When queen Amestris found out, she did not seek revenge against Artaynte, but against her mother, Masistes' wife, as Amestris thought that it was her connivance. On Xerxes' birthday, Amestris sent for his guards and mutilated Masistes' wife by cutting off her breasts and threw them to dogs, and her nose and ears and lips also, and cutting out her tongue as well. On seeing this, Masistes fled to Bactria to start a revolt, but was intercepted by Xerxes' army who killed him and his sons.\nPassage 10:\nHafsa Hatun\nHafsa Hatun (Ottoman Turkish: \u062d\u0641\u0635\u0647 \u062e\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0646, \"young lioness\") was a Turkish princess, and a consort of Bayezid I, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nLife\nHafsa Hatun was the daughter of Isa Bey, the ruler of the Aydinids. She was married to Bayezid in 1390, upon his conquest of the Aydinids. Her father had surrendered without a fight, and a marriage was arranged between her and Bayezid. Thereafter, Isa was sent into exile in Iznik, shorn of his power, where he subsequently died. Her marriage strengthened the bonds between the two families.\n\nCharities\nHafsa Hatun's public works are located within her father's territory and may have been built before she married Bayezid. She commissioned a fountain in Tire city and a Hermitage in Bademiye, and a mosque known as \"Hafsa Hatun Mosque\" between 1390 and 1392 from the money she received in her dowry.\n\nSee also\nOttoman dynasty\nOttoman Empire",

She started her career as a child actress. Later she appeared in lead actress and supporting actress roles. She has acted in over 300 films in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, and Bhojpuri languages. She won two Nandi Awards and one Filmfare Award.\n\nCareer\nTulasi made her debut in the Telugu language when she was three months old in 1967. For a song in a film, a baby was needed and Tulasi was placed in the cradle after actress Savitri had requested Tulasi's mother, who was a friend of her. She was featured in a song when she was three-and-half years old in Jeevanatarangalu and said that she became a full-fledged actor when she was four. She had never been to school.She got married at age 28 to Kannada director Sivamani. She stated, \"I met him in the morning and by evening we tied the knot\". They have one son, Sai Tarun. Tulasi decided to quit acting after getting married, working only occasionally as a voice actor in Telugu films, including ones by Mani Ratnam. When her son was around six years old, she received several mother character roles. She initially declined them all, but finally signed on one Kannada film, Excuse Me, in which she played mother to Divya Spandana and which became a big hit. After that she was doing three films a year in Kannada.\nShe began to act mainly in mother roles in Telugu and Tamil film industries. Her notable supporting roles include performances in Sasirekha Parinayam, Mr. Perfect, Darling, Srimanthudu, Iddarammayilatho, Nenu Local, Mahanati & Dear Comrade in Telugu and Pillaiyar Theru Kadaisi Veedu, Easan, Mankatha, Sundarapandian, Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer and Pandiya Naadu in Tamil. Tulasi has said that Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer, in which she had played mother to Manisha Yadav's character, changed her life and brought her an \"identity as a screen mother\". Her portrayal of Chellamma in Pannaiyarum Padminiyum was praised too, with critics stating that she was \"brilliant\", and had given her \"career best performance\".\n\nPartial filmography\nAwards\nNandi AwardsBest Child Actress - Seetamalakshmi (1978)\nBest Child Actress - Sankarabharanam (1980)Filmfare Awards SouthFilmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress - Kannada - Josh\nPassage 3:\nStokkseyrar-D\u00edsa\nThordis Markusdottir (\u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds Mark\u00fasd\u00f3ttir), known as Stokkseyrar-D\u00edsa (1668\u20131728), was an Icelandic magician (Galdrmaster). She is known in history for her alleged magical powers. She is the subject of a least ten different folk sagas depicting her experiments within magic or Galdr.\nThordis Markusdottir belonged to the elite of the Iceland and was the grandchild of sheriff Torfi Erlendsson of Stafnes and related to Thormodus Torf\u00e6us, historian of the King of Denmark.

She was past normal child-bearing age when she conceived and gave birth to John.\n\nBiblical narrative\nAccording to the Gospel of Luke chapter 1, Elizabeth was \"of the daughters of Aaron\". She and her husband Zechariah/Zachariah were \"righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless\" (1:5\u20137), but childless. While he was in the temple of the Lord (1:8\u201312), Zachariah was visited by the angel Gabriel:\n\nBut the angel said to him: \u201cDo not be afraid, Zechariah; your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.\nZachariah doubted whereby he could know this since both he and his wife were old. The angel identified himself as Gabriel and told Zachariah that he would be \"dumb, and not able to speak\" until the words were fulfilled, because he did not believe. When the days of his ministry were complete, he returned to his house (Luke 1:16\u201323).\n\nAfter this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. \u201cThe Lord has done this for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIn these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.\u201d\nAccording to the account, the angel Gabriel was then sent to Nazareth in Galilee to her relative Mary, a virgin, betrothed to a man called Joseph, and informed her that she would conceive by the Holy Spirit and bring forth a son to be called Jesus. Mary was also informed that her \"relative Elizabeth\" had begun her sixth month of pregnancy, and Mary traveled to \"a town in the hill country of Judah\", to visit Elizabeth (Luke 1:26\u201340).\n\nWhen Elizabeth heard Mary\u2019s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice she exclaimed: \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!\"\nMatthew Henry comments, \"Mary knew that Elizabeth was with child, but it does not appear that Elizabeth had been told anything of her relative Mary's being designed for the mother of the Messiah; and therefore what knowledge she appears to have had of it must have come by a revelation, which would be a great encouragement to Mary.\" After Mary heard Elizabeth's blessing, she spoke the words now known as the Magnificat (Luke 1:46\u201355). \n\nMary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son. Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah, but his mother spoke up and said, \u201cNo! He is to be called John.\u201dThey said to her, \u201cThere is no one among your relatives who has that name.\u201dThen they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child. He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone\u2019s astonishment he wrote, \u201cHis name is John.\u201d Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God.\nThat is the last mention of Elizabeth, who is not mentioned in any other chapter in the Bible. The chapter continues with the prophecy of Zachariah (known as the Benedictus,) and ends with the note that John \"grew, and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts\" until his ministry to Israel began; so it is unknown how long Elizabeth and her husband lived after that (Luke 1:65\u201380).\nSince the Medieval era, Elizabeth's greeting, \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,\" has formed the second part of the Hail Mary prayer.A traditional \"tomb of Elizabeth\" is shown in the Franciscan Monastery of Saint John in the Wilderness near Jerusalem.\n\nApocrypha\nElizabeth is mentioned in several books of the Apocrypha, most prominently in the Protevangelion of James, in which the birth of her son, the subsequent murder of her husband, as well as her and John's miraculous escape during the Massacre of the Innocents are chronicled.\n\nSainthood\nElizabeth is revered as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church on 5 November, and in the Orthodox and Anglican traditions on 5 September, on the same day with her husband Zacharias/Zechariah. She is commemorated as a matriarch in the Calendar of Saints (5 September) of the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod and Zacharias is commemorated as a prophet.She is also commemorated on 30 March in Eastern Orthodox Church (Visitation).\n\nIslam\nElizabeth (Arabic: Isha', daughter of Faqudh), the wife of Zakaria, the mother of Yahya, is an honored woman in Islam. Although Zachariah himself is frequently mentioned by name in the Qur'an, Elizabeth, while not mentioned by name, is referenced. She is revered by Muslims as a wise, pious and believing person who, like her relative Mary, was exalted by God to a high station. She lived in the household of Imran, and is said to have been a descendant of the prophet and priest Harun.Zachariah and his wife were both devout and steadfast in their duties. They were, however, both very old and they had no son. Therefore, Zachariah would frequently pray to God for a son. This was not only out of the desire to have a son but also because the great Jesus wanted someone to carry on the services of the Temple of prayer and to continue the preaching of the Lord's message before his death.\nGod cured Elizabeth's barrenness and granted Zachariah a son, Yahya (John the Baptist), who became a prophet. God thus granted the wishes of the couple because of their faith, trust and love for God. In the Qur'an, God speaks of Zachariah, his wife, and John, and describes the three as being humble servants of the Lord:\n\nSo We listened to him: and We granted him John: We cured his wife's (Barrenness) for him. These (three) were ever quick in emulation in good works; they used to call on Us with love and reverence, and humble themselves before Us.\nIn Sunni Islamic reports of al-Tabari and al-Masudi, Elizabeth is said to have been a daughter of Imran, and thus, a sister of Mary. Therefore, their children Jesus (Isa) and John (Yahya) are believed to have been cousins. In other accounts, Elizabeth is said to be a daughter of Fakudh, and a sister of Imran's wife Hannah.In Shia hadith she is named Hananah, and is identified as a sister of Mary's mother Hannah. Abu Basir recorded that Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, the great grandson of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, had stated: \"Hannah, the wife of Imran, and Hananah, the wife of Zechariah, were sisters. He goes on to say that Mary was born from Hannah and John was born from Hananah. Mary gave birth to Jesus and he was the son of the daughter of John's aunt. John was the son of the aunt of Mary, and the aunt of one's mother is like one's aunt.\"\n\nMandaeism\nIn Mandaeism, Eni\u0161bai (Classical Mandaic: \u084f\u084d\u0849\u0854\u0841\u0840\u0849, romanized: \u02bfni\u0161bai) is the Mandaic name for Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist. Eni\u0161bai is mentioned in chapters 18, 21, and 32 of the Mandaean Book of John.\n\nSee also\nGospel of Luke\nVisitation (Catholic feast)\nEin Kerem, traditional home town of Elizabeth, Zechariah and John\nBiblical figures in Islamic tradition\nSaint Elizabeth, patron saint archive\n\nNotes and references\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

The name of Sobe first appears in writings of about the 7th century by Hippolytus of Thebes, Andrew of Crete, and Epiphanius Monachus, and later in Nicephorus Callistus and Andronicus. All recount essentially the same passage, given by the last two as follows:\n\nThere were three sisters of Bethlehem, daughters of Matthan the priest, and Mary his wife, under the reign of Cleopatra and Sosipatrus, before the reign of Herod, the son of Antipater: the eldest was Mary, the second was Sobe, the youngest's name was Anne.

Du Boisrouvray broadened its work from supporting children impacted by AIDS to also include all families needing support to emerge from extreme poverty and become self-sufficient through the FXBVillage methodology. In 1991, she developed the FXBVillage Methodology, a community-based, sustainable approach to overcoming the AIDS orphans crisis and extreme poverty. Each FXBVillage supports 80-100 families, comprising approximately 500 individuals, mostly children. Over a three-year period, FXB provides communities with the resources and training needed to become physically, financially and socially independent.

He is the only grandchild of Oscar Wilde, whose life he has researched and written about extensively.\n\nBiography\nBorn in London in December 1945, Christopher Merlin Vyvyan Holland is the son of the author Vyvyan Holland and his second wife, Thelma Besant. He is the only grandchild of Oscar Wilde and Constance Lloyd.His mother Thelma was an Australian cosmetician who became the personal beauty adviser to Queen Elizabeth II for about 10 years from the mid-1940s. His paternal grandmother, Constance, had changed her and her children's surname to Holland (an old family name) in 1895, after Wilde had been convicted of homosexual acts and imprisoned, in order to gain some privacy for the boys and distance from the scandal.\n\nWork\nHolland has studied and researched Wilde's life for more than thirty years. He is the co-editor, with Rupert Hart-Davis, of The Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde. He is the editor of Irish Peacock and Scarlet Marquess, the first uncensored version of his grandfather's 1895 trials.  (The book is titled The Real Trial of Oscar Wilde for release in the US.)Holland has criticised Richard Ellmann's 1987 biography, Oscar Wilde, as inaccurate, particularly his claim that Wilde had syphilis and transmitted it to Constance. According to The Guardian, Holland has  \"unearthed medical evidence within private family letters, which has enabled a doctor to determine the likely cause of Constance's death. The letters reveal symptoms nowadays associated with multiple sclerosis but apparently wrongly diagnosed by her two doctors. One, an unnamed German 'nerve doctor', resorted to dubious remedies and the other, Luigi Maria Bossi, conducted a botched operation that days later claimed her life.\"Holland has also written The Wilde Album, a small volume that included hitherto unpublished photographs of Wilde. The book focuses on how the scandal caused by Wilde's trials affected his family, most notably his wife, Constance, and their children, Cyril and Vyvyan.  \nIn 2006, his book Oscar Wilde: A Life in Letters was published, and his volume Coffee with Oscar Wilde, an imagined conversation with Wilde, was released in the autumn of 2007. Holland also wrote A Portrait of Oscar Wilde (2008), which reveals Wilde through manuscripts and letters from the Lucia Moreira Salles collection, located at The Morgan Library & Museum in New York City.In addition, Holland has also worked as a wine writer and occasionally written features for Country Life, and The Oldie.In July 2013, Holland gave the keynote address for a symposium on Oscar Wilde presented by The Santa Fe Opera. The address surveyed the popular and critical attitudes towards Wilde and his work from the end of his life to the present day. The symposium was given in conjunction with the opera company's world premiere presentations of Oscar, composed by Theodore Morrison with a libretto written by John Cox and the composer.Holland's play The Trials of Oscar Wilde, co-authored with John O'Connor and re-enacting the 1895 trials of Lord Queensberry for libel and Oscar Wilde for gross indecency, toured the United Kingdom in 2014 in a production by the European Arts Company.\n\nPersonal life\nHolland lives in Burgundy, France, with his second wife. His son, Lucian Holland (born 1979 to Merlin's first wife Sarah), studied classics at Magdalen College. He occupied rooms that his great-grandfather Wilde had occupied. He is a computer programmer, living in London.Merlin Holland briefly toyed with the idea of changing his name back to Wilde. He told The New York Times in 1998, \u201cBut if I did it, it would have to be not just for Oscar, but for his father and mother, too, for the whole family. It was an extraordinary family before he came along, so if I put the family name back on the map for the right reasons, then it's all right.\u201d\n\nPublished works\n1998 \u2013 The Wilde Album\n2003 \u2013 Irish Peacock and Scarlet Marquess: The Real Trial of Oscar Wilde\n2004 \u2013 The Real Trial of Oscar Wilde\nPassage 10:\nPrincess Elizabeth of Great Britain\nPrincess Elizabeth Caroline of Great Britain (10 January 1741 \u2013 4 September 1759) was one of the children of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. She was a granddaughter of King George II and sister of King George III.\n\nLife\nPrincess Elizabeth was born at Norfolk House, St James's Square, Westminster. Her father was The Prince Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of King George II and Caroline of Ansbach. Her mother was The Princess of Wales (n\u00e9e Augusta of Saxe-Gotha). She was christened twenty-five days later at Norfolk House, by The Bishop of Oxford, Thomas Secker \u2014 her godparents were The Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach (her first cousin once-removed by marriage; for whom The Lord Baltimore (Gentleman of the Bedchamber to her father) stood proxy), The Queen of Denmark (for whom Anne, Viscountess Irwin stood proxy) and the Duchess of Saxe-Gotha (her maternal aunt by marriage, for whom Lady Jane Hamilton stood proxy).Little is known of her short life other than a fragment preserved in the Letters of Walpole.\n\nWe have lost another Princess, Lady Elizabeth.  She died of an inflammation in her bowels in two days.  Her figure was so very unfortunate, that it would have been difficult for her to be happy, but her parts and application were extraordinary.  I saw her act in \"Cato\" at eight years old, (when she could not stand alone, but was forced to lean against the side-scene,) better than any of her brothers and sisters.  She had been so unhealthy, that at that age she had not been taught to read, but had learned the part of Lucia by hearing the others study their parts. She went to her father and mother, and begged she might act. They put her off as gently as they could\u2014she desired leave to repeat her part, and when she did, it was with so much sense, that there was no denying her.\nShe died on 4 September 1759 at Kew Palace, London and was buried at Westminster Abbey.\n\nAncestors\nSee also\nList of British princesses",

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art.

After moving to Paris in 1995, he wrote articles in Les Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma. He started writing soon after. His 1996 book Tout contre L\u00e9o (Close to Leo) talks about HIV and is aimed at young adults; he made it into a film in 2002. He wrote other books for young adults throughout the late 1990s. His first play, Les D\u00e9butantes, was performed at Avignon's Off Festival in 1998. In 2005, he returned to Avignon to present Dionysos impuissant in the \"In\" Festival, with Joana Preiss and Louis Garrel playing the leads.\nA well-known director, he is considered an \"auteur\" in French cinema. His 2006 film Dans Paris has led him to be considered by French critics as the heir to the Nouvelle Vague cinema. In 2007, Les Chansons d'amour was one of the films selected to be in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Honor\u00e9 is openly gay, and some of his movies or screenplays (among them Les Filles ne savent pas nager, Dix-sept fois C\u00e9cile Cassard and Les Chansons d'amour) deal with gay or lesbian relations. His film Plaire, aimer et courir vite (Sorry Angel), about a writer who has contracted HIV in the 1990s, won the Louis Delluc Prize for Best Film in 2018. Honor\u00e9 has been the screenwriter for some of Ga\u00ebl Morel's films. The actors Louis Garrel and Chiara Mastroianni have each had roles in several of his films.\nHonor\u00e9 has also directed several operas for the stage. For the Op\u00e9ra de Lyon he directed Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites in 2013,  Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande in 2015, and Verdi's Don Carlos in 2018. He also presented his production of Mozart's Cos\u00ec fan tutte at the Aix-en-Provence Festival and the Edinburgh Festival in 2016, and Puccini's Tosca at Aix-en-Provence in 2019; both of these productions adopted a radical approach to traditional works.In the summer of 2020 Honor\u00e9's rehearsals of his stage production of Le C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Guermantes, based on the third volume of Proust's In Search of Lost Time, were interrupted by restrictions to combat the COVID-19 epidemic and it became impossible to present it at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise as planned. With his troupe of actors he decided to make a film about the production and the uncertainties they were now facing, and the film Guermantes was released in September 2021.\n\nFilmography\nNovels\n1995 : Tout contre L\u00e9o (jeunesse), turned into a film in 2002\n1996 : C'est plus fort que moi (jeunesse)\n1997 : Je joue tr\u00e8s bien tout seul (jeunesse)\n1997 : L'Affaire petit Marcel (jeunesse)\n1997 : L\u2019Infamille (\u00c9ditions de l'Olivier, ISBN 2-87929-143-7)\n1998 : Z\u00e9ro de lecture (jeunesse)\n1998 : Une toute petite histoire d'amour (jeunesse)\n1998 : Je ne suis pas une fille \u00e0 papa (jeunesse)\n1999 : Les Nuits o\u00f9 personne ne dort (jeunesse)\n1999 : Mon c\u0153ur boulevers\u00e9  (jeunesse)\n1999 : Bretonneries (jeunesse)\n1999 : La Douceur (\u00c9ditions de L'Olivier, ISBN 2-87929-236-0)\n\nTheatre and opera\nActor\n1998: Les D\u00e9butantes\n2001: Le Pire du troupeau\n2004: Beautiful Guys\n2005: Dionysos impuissant\n2012: La Facult\u00e9\n2012: Un jeune se tue\n2012: Nouveau Roman\n2015: Violentes femmes\n\nDirector\n2009 : Angelo, Tyrant of Padua by Victor Hugo, Festival d'Avignon\n2012 : Nouveau Roman, Festival d'Avignon, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre national de la Colline\n2013 : Dialogues of the Carmelites by Francis Poulenc, Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon\n2015 : Fin de l'Histoire by Witold Gombrowicz, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Lorient\n2015 : Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande by Claude Debussy, Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon\n2016 : Cos\u00ec fan tutte by Mozart, Aix-en-Provence Festival and Edinburgh International Festival\n2018 : Don Carlos by Verdi, Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon\n2019 : Les Idoles by Christophe Honor\u00e9, Od\u00e9on-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Europe\n2019 : Tosca by Puccini, Aix-en-Provence Festival\nPassage 8:\nMan at Bath\nMan at Bath (French: Homme au bain) is a 2010 French film by Christophe Honor\u00e9 starring Fran\u00e7ois Sagat and Chiara Mastroianni. The film premiered in competition at Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland in 2010 and was released in cinemas on 22 September 2010.\nThis is gay pornographic actor Fran\u00e7ois Sagat's second major role in general release non-pornographic film as Emmanuel after his role in L.A. Zombie. Director Christopher Honor\u00e9 told French gay website Yagg.com that he was interested in Sagat because he \"redefines the notion of masculinity\". Sagat was the only actor to feature in two competition entries during the festival.\n\nPlot\nRight before departing to New York colleges to promote his latest collaborations, Omar (Omar Ben Sellem) goes through yet another impulsive fit from his boyfriend Emmanuel (Fran\u00e7ois Sagat), resulting in rape. Resentful, Omar demands Emmanuel to be gone from his flat located in the outskirts of Paris before his return, and leaves. The two set out to live a separate series of vignettes depicting the ways the former lovers' mourn for each other.\nBeing a lustful, aspiring filmmaker, Omar sees his touring in upper New York as an opportunity to finally forget Emmanuel, indulging instead in disjointed recordings of his travel. Soon after, his camera work is centered on Dustin (Dustin Segura-Suarez): a young college student who is on vacation from Canada. Omar eagerly befriends and later seduces Dustin, openly portraying their desire for each other on film with an amateurish academic intent. In a matter of days, the artistic intentions in Omar's house movie devolve into a bisexual experience including Omar's professor.\nBack in Paris, an animalistic Emmanuel - used to take pride on the universal praise for his body - is left broke and in denial. He resorts instead to shelter himself in Omar's place, living as carefree days as he can muster. Emmanuel goes from demanding unsolicited attentions from an upstairs neighbor who also is one of his clients as a hustler (Dennis Cooper), to hosting sexual encounters with Omar's acquaintances. All without avoiding his growing yearning for the better days with his ex, not even after luring an Omar's look-alike (Sebastian D'Azeglio) back into the apartment. After an intermission in which Emmanuel is confronted with his own collapsing lack of emotionality, he then clumsily refuses the advances of an underage boy who claims to be in need (Andr\u00e9as Leflamand), nor engages in a bisexual threesome in exchange for a tip he reluctantly accepts from a successful old friend (Kate Moran). The next day, Emmanuel begrudgingly succumbs to the advances from a teenager (Rabah Zahi), and uses the opportunity to sexually lash out on the boy. Finally, shortly before Omar's return, Emmanuel cries over the improvised mural he started days earlier on one of the walls in the apartment.\nNot long after, Omar enters back into his apartment, stopping to contemplate the finished mural drawn by Emmanuel, who is nowhere to be seen.\n\nCast\nFran\u00e7ois Sagat as Emmanuel\nChiara Mastroianni as Actress\nRabah Zahi as Rabah\nOmar Ben Sellem as Omar\nKate Moran as Kate\nLahcen el Mazouzi as Hicham\nAndr\u00e9as Leflamand as Andr\u00e9as\nRonald Piwele as Ronald\nSebastian D'Azeglio as Man with a moustache\nS\u00e9bastien Pouderoux as Kate's fianc\u00e9\nDennis Cooper as Robin\nDustin Segura-Suarez\nPassage 9:\nPaul Scheuring\nPaul T. Scheuring (born November 20, 1968) is an American screenwriter and director of films and television shows. His work includes the 2003 film A Man Apart and the creation of the television drama Prison Break, for which he was also credited as an executive producer and head writer.\n\nEarly life\nScheuring was born in Aurora, Illinois. Before his success, he had attended the UCLA School of Theater Film and Television and has worked as a courier cable installer and factory worker.\n\nCareer\nAfter working on 36K in 2000 and A Man Apart in 2003, Scheuring made his first attempt to be a television show writer. After developing an idea given to him by a female colleague into a miniseries screenplay called Prison Break, he approached the Fox network with the script but was turned down due to its unconventional storyline. However, in 2004, after the successful premiere of Lost, Fox backed Prison Break's production and the first episode was aired approximately twenty months after Scheuring had written the script. The series proceeded to win the 2006 People's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Drama and was nominated for Best Drama Television Series at the 2006 Golden Globe Awards. Moreover, Prison Break was picked up by Fox for three more seasons. In 2005, he signed an overall deal with 20th Century Fox. He runs a production company, One Light Road Productions.Scheuring has also co-written Mexicali, which was scheduled for release in 2010.\n\nFuture projects\nFollowing the completion of Prison Break, Scheuring began production of AR2, a drama co-developed with The West Wing director/exec producer Thomas Schlamme. The series is about a group of Midwestern youths who spark a second American Revolution. AR2 will explore how the revolting college students -- as well as the military and the law enforcement officers who oppose them -- perceive patriotism. Scheuring lessened his work on Fox's Prison Break to focus on development and features through his Mercator Pictures, which he operates with partner Matt Fiorello. He has also produced Masterwork, a drama pilot script for Fox and 20th TV, and the Inferno-produced feature The Experiment.\nScheuring was also confirmed to be the writer for Halo: Nightfall. A 5 episode series which is based upon the video game franchise connecting the story line between Halo 4 and Halo 5: Guardians\n\nFilmography\nPassage 10:\nOlav Aaraas\nOlav Aaraas (born 10 July 1950) is a Norwegian historian and museum director.\nHe was born in Fredrikstad. From 1982 to 1993 he was the director of Sogn Folk Museum, from 1993 to 2010 he was the director of Maihaugen and from 2001 he has been the director of the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History. In 2010 he was decorated with the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav.",
    "Passage 1:\nBetty Hall\nBeatrice Perin Barker Hall (March 18, 1921 \u2013 April 26, 2018) was an American politician from the state of New Hampshire. Hall served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives for a total of 28 years, serving non-consecutively from 1970 until 2008.\nHall grew up in New York City, where she attended Barnard College. In 1948, she and her husband moved to the town of Brookline, New Hampshire, where they started a textile manufacturing firm. Beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s, Hall began participating in local politics, serving on several boards and commissions in Brookline. Hall was elected to the Brookline school board in 1963, and in 1972, she was elected to the town board of selectmen.\nHall's career in statewide politics began in 1970 when she was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives as a member of the Republican Party. In 1986, Hall switched her party affiliation to the Democratic Party, citing the Republican Party's shift towards conservatism during the Reagan Era. During her political career, Hall was described as a firebrand who frequently bucked her party. While a Republican, Hall was seen as a liberal member of that party, and was considered to be a political enemy by conservative leaders. In the Democratic Party, Hall was a member of the grassroots base, challenging the party's establishment in a 2007 campaign for chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party.\nIn the 2000s, Hall became nationally known for her activism. In 2004, she was arrested for disorderly conduct for her participation in a protest against President George W. Bush; she was later acquitted of the charge. In 2008, Hall introduced New Hampshire House Resolution 24, which would have petitioned the United States Congress to introduce articles to impeach President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for their actions leading to and during the Iraq War. While the bill ultimately failed, it generated a large amount of media coverage.\n\nPre-political life and career\nEarly life and education\nBeatrice Perin Barker was born on March 18, 1921, in Koblenz, Germany, where her father Joseph Warren Barker, a United States Army officer, served as the administrator of a military district following World War I. After leaving the military, Barker's father completed his education in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, receiving an academic position at the institution. He later became the Dean of Engineering at Columbia University, and she primarily grew up in New York City. This led to Barker's entry into academia, as her father's position at Columbia University brought prominent scientists such as Enrico Fermi and Harold Urey to their home for dinner where Barker would serve as a hostess. In 1937, her mother Mary died when Barker was 16.Barker attended the Horace Mann School and later studied engineering at Barnard College. Barker would later do graduate work at the University of New Hampshire, Boston University, and the College of the Holy Cross.\n\nFamily and career\nAfter graduating from Barnard College in 1943, Barker worked as an engineer at Western Electric. During World War II, she helped manufacture vacuum tubes for radar equipment, and her father served as a special assistant to Frank Knox, the United States Secretary of the Navy.On May 27, 1944, she married Sidney Leavitt Hall, an engineer from Concord, New Hampshire, leaving her job at Western Electric to join her husband in Ohio, where he was undergoing training with the United States Air Force in order to fight in World War II. However, the war ended before he was sent overseas, and in 1948, the couple moved to Brookline, New Hampshire, a town of 800 people in Hillsborough County. Hall's grandmother, Florence Hobart Perin, was a resident of Brookline, and Hall had frequently visited and spent several summers in the town during her youth. Sidney Hall initially worked at Textron, and in 1951, the couple started a textile manufacturing firm called Hall Manufacturing Company, which was informally known as Hall Tote Bags. The company produced stitching for dry-cleaners, as well as steam air covers for dry-cleaning machines. Later, the company became locally famous for the tote bags they produced, as well as other stitched products. Hall and her husband were members of the local Church of Christ, and she was credited with uniting the Brookline Methodist and Congregationalist churches into one single church.In 1957, Hall received a fellowship from the National Science Foundation. Hall served as the assistant manager for Hall Manufacturing Co. until 1962, whereupon she became a science and mathematics teacher in Groton, Massachusetts. Hall transferred to Fairgrounds Junior High School in Nashua, New Hampshire, in 1964, and taught mathematics there until 1972. In 1968, Hall was awarded a grant by the Research Corporation for Science Advancement in order to start an experimental \"Mathematics Learning Laboratory\" at her school. She had also been invited to academic conferences, such as the Advanced Modern Math Institute, which was sponsored by Science Research Associates.Sidney Hall died in 1987 at the age of 66. Hall and her husband had 4 sons and 1 daughter. One of their sons, Sidney Hall Jr., is a locally-known author.  Following her husband's death, Hall solely ran Hall Manufacturing Co., and the company was featured in a White House symposium on small businesses in 1994. Hall Manufacturing Co. closed in 2001.\n\nEarly political career\nLocal politics\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Hall became very active in local politics, serving on numerous boards and committees in Brookline, including the board of assessors and the town finance committee. In 1961, Hall was defeated in an election for Brookline library trustee. In 1963, Hall was elected unopposed to the Brookline school board. She was re-elected in 1966, defeating future state representative Eben Bartlett and another candidate. In 1969, Hall was re-elected for her third and final term on the school board. She served as the chairman of the school board from 1964 until 1968 and again in 1971. She served a total of 9 years on the school board.In 1967, Hall ran for the Brookline board of selectmen; however, she was defeated by Walter W. Frost, receiving 138 votes to Frost's 152. In 1972, Hall served as the chairman of the Brookline Republican Town Committee. Later that year, Hall again ran for the Brookline board of selectmen to succeed the retiring Grover C. Farwell, defeating two candidates to win a three-year term as selectman. Following her election to the board of selectmen, Hall did not seek another term for the school board and resigned as a teacher. In 1974, Hall served as the chairman of the board of selectmen.\n\nEarly 1970s\nIn 1970, Hall ran for the New Hampshire House of Representatives in Hillsborough County's 13th district as a member of the Republican Party. Hall had decided to run for state office because she \"realized she was not accomplishing what she wanted to\" in local office. She was recruited to run by Governor Walter R. Peterson Jr. Hall and fellow Republican Daniel Brocklebank were elected with 43% and 41% of the vote, respectively. In 1972, Hall ran for re-election in Hillsborough County's 12th district, and was elected unopposed alongside fellow Republican Jack Boyd. During the 1970s, Hall held multiple positions in the local Republican Party, serving as a member of the Republican state committee the Hillsborough County Republican Party Executive Committee.\n\n1974 state senate campaign\nIn 1974, Hall ran for the 12th district of the New Hampshire Senate, running to replace retiring Republican incumbent Frederick A. Porter. In the Republican primary, Hall faced fellow state representative D. Alan Rock, as well as Milford town selectman Frederic Fletcher, a former state senator and former member of the Executive Council. During the primary, Hall campaigned via bicycle, cycling a total of 1,000 miles through the 26 towns in the district. Hall won the primary election, narrowly defeating Rock. Despite Hall placing second in her hometown of Brookline and only winning two towns, Amherst and Hollis, both towns gave her large margins. Additionally, she placed second in nearly every other town in the district, offsetting the large margin by which Rock won in Nashua. Official sources conflict on the final vote tally: the New Hampshire General Court officially reported that Hall received 1,544 votes, Rock received 1,485 votes, and Fletcher received 1,198 votes, giving Hall a winning margin of just 59 votes. However, a recount found that the margin was actually 114 votes in favor of Hall, with the town of Amherst alone overcounting 50 ballots in favor of Rock; however, the results of the recount are not officially recorded. Hall's campaign expenditure for the primary was $1,470.While there was no official Democratic Party candidate running in the heavily Republican district, both Hall and Rock also contested the Democratic primary as write-in candidates. Rock won the Democratic write-in nomination, with official sources again conflicting on the tally: the New Hampshire General Court reported that Rock received 72 votes to Hall's 71, a margin of just one vote, while a recount reportedly increased Rock's margin to 3 votes.During the general election campaign, Rock was heavily supported by William Loeb III, the publisher of the Manchester Union Leader, an influential conservative newspaper. Rock frequently used the newspaper's front page to promote his campaign. While Hall was endorsed by the Nashua Telegraph, her campaign did not have the media capabilities that Rock's did, and Rock ultimately won the general election, defeating Hall by a margin of 53% to 47%. Judd Gregg, then the chairman of the Nashua Republican Party, alleged that the party's campaign literature had been tampered with; specifically, Gregg alleged that an individual had switched out Hall's campaign literature from several envelopes and replaced it with Rock's campaign literature before they were sent out to voters in Nashua. However, Hall stated that she did not believe the incident had influenced the end result of the election. Hall was succeeded in the state house by Republican Dorothy Foss Colson.\n\nLate 1970s and early 1980s\nIn 1975, Hall became the chairman of the New Hampshire branch of Common Cause, a lobbying group that opposes corruption and promotes campaign finance reform. In this role, Hall advocated for good government. In the 1976 presidential election, Hall criticized Republican candidate Ronald Reagan and independent candidate Eugene McCarthy for being the only two major candidates who had not agreed to the campaign standards proposed by Common Cause. She later criticized all the presidential candidates for not discussing the costs of the programs they propose. Hall left the position in September 1977.In 1978, Hall was elected back to the New Hampshire House of Representatives for Hillsborough County's 12th district. Hall and fellow Republican Eliot B. Ware won with 36% and 31% of the vote. Hall and Ware were re-elected unopposed in 1980.In November 1980, Rock, who had still serving as the state senator for the 12th district, died of cancer just three days after winning re-election. Hall was one of four candidates vying for the Republican nomination for the February 1981 special election; instead of being elected in a primary election, the party nominee was instead to be selected by delegates of the Hillsborough County Republican Party. Hall's campaign for the nomination was heavily opposed by Robert B. Monier, the influential Republican president of the New Hampshire Senate, who viewed Hall as a political opponent. Monier instead supported John Stabile, a Nashua businessman and the New Hampshire campaign chair for John Connally's 1980 presidential campaign. The other Republican candidates were state representatives Joanne Head, Philip Labombarde, and Emma Wheeler. Despite an initial convention ending in deadlock, with 9 delegates voting for Hall and the other 9 for Stabile, the party reconvened and ultimately selected Stabile to be the Republican nominee. Stabile would go on to defeat Democratic state representative Selma Pastor and independent candidate Mark Knox, a Nashua alderman, in the special election.In 1982, Hall ran for the 11th district of the New Hampshire Senate to replace retiring Republican incumbent Arthur Mann. Hall placed third in the Republican primary, losing to fellow state representative Jean T. White; Hall received 29% of the vote, while White received 40%. The second-place candidate, state representative Richard Amidon, received 31% of the vote. However, Hall won the Democratic nomination as a write-in candidate, receiving 199 votes compared to White's 81 and Amidon's 55. Hall was defeated by White in the general election, receiving 4,668 votes to White's 6,632.\n\nParty switch and later political career\nLate 1980s and 1990s\nIn 1986, Hall switched to the Democratic Party, citing the Republican Party's shift towards conservatism. That year, Hall ran as a Democrat for the state house in Hillsborough County's 16th district. Hall defeated incumbent Republican state representative Barbara Fried, who had been facing charges of embezzlement after it was revealed she used her position as Greenville town clerk to embezzle $10,000 in fees. Hall received 642 votes, while Fried received 555. Hall was narrowly re-elected in 1988, defeating Republican candidate Shirley A. Morley by just 54 votes out of 2,274 cast. Hall was re-elected in 1990, defeating former Republican state representative Webster E. Bridges, 56% to 44%.In 1992, Hall ran for re-election in Hillsborough County's 20th district. Hall and Republican Thomas I. Arnold were elected, receiving 1,488 votes and 1,384 votes, respectively. Hall and Arnold had previously served together on the Brookline school board in the 1960s, where Arnold was the school board's moderator. The two were re-elected unopposed in 1994. In 1996, they were again re-elected, with Hall receiving 46% of the vote and Arnold receiving 36%. In 1996, Hall served as the chairman of the Hillsborough County Democratic Party. In 1998, Hall and Arnold were again re-elected. Arnold received 1,063 votes, while Hall received 1,001.Hall was an early supporter of Bill Clinton in the 1992 United States presidential election, and was a delegate for Clinton at the 1996 Democratic Party convention. Hall also praised Richard Lugar during the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries, supporting his tax policy and stating that he seemed honest.\n\n2000s\nIn 2000, Hall and Arnold were re-elected unopposed. In 2002, Hall ran for re-election in Hillsborough County's 46th district. However, Hall was defeated in the general election, placing fifth with 12% of the vote.In 2004, Hall was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct at a protest against President George W. Bush in Nashua. Hall, who was 83 at the time, was sitting in a chair outside the designated area for protestors, and was close to the presidential motorcade route. Hall was also holding a sign that said, \"Bush is bad for America\". After Hall refused to move, three police officers picked Hall up, \"chair, cane, and all\", carrying her away and arresting her. A photographer captured the arrest, and the incident became national news. Hall was acquitted in September 2004 after Nashua District Court judge Clifford Kinghorn ruled that the evidence provided did not fit the charge of disorderly conduct; Kinghorn stated that \"the police had no authority under state law to make Hall move because she wasn't getting in their way\". Hall also explained that she had originally written the law that was being applied to her case.Later in 2004, Hall ran again for the state house for Hillsborough County's 5th district. Hall won, placing fourth with 13% of the vote. In the 2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Hall was a supporter of Howard Dean's campaign. Hall was re-elected in 2006, placing fourth and receiving 13% of the vote; Hall narrowly defeated fellow incumbent Donald Ryder, a Republican, receiving just 25 more votes than him.In 2007, Hall announced her candidacy for chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Her main opponent was Raymond Buckley, the vice chair of the state party and an executive member of the Democratic National Committee. During the campaign, Buckley, who was considered to be the frontrunner, was falsely accused of possessing child pornography by former state representative Steve Vaillancourt, who had been a former friend of his. Buckley was exonerated following an official state investigation, and Vaillancourt later stated that he had exaggerated in the allegations. Later in the campaign, Joe Kelly Levasseur, the chairman of the Manchester Republican Party, posted an old home video of Buckley to YouTube, in which Buckley, who is openly gay, is seen \"cursing and unzipping his pants\", as well as highlighting Buckley's membership in a MySpace group called \"Gays in New Hampshire\". Despite this, Buckley maintained his support amongst statewide Democrats, with the exception of U.S. representative Paul Hodes, who withdrew his support for Buckley following the release of the video. Buckley ultimately defeated Hall, receiving 109 votes to Hall's 17. A third candidate, former state house Democratic Leader Jim Craig, withdrew following Buckley's exoneration, but remained on the ballot.\n\nProposed impeachment of George W. Bush\nIn 2008, Hall again gained national prominence for introducing a bill in the New Hampshire House of Representatives which would petition the United States Congress to introduce articles to impeach President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for high crimes and misdemeanors relating to the Iraq War. The bill accused Bush and Cheney of electioneering, torture, unlawful surveillance, misleading Congress, and violating the United Nations Charter by engaging in an unlawful aggressive war, as well as other alleged crimes. The bill, New Hampshire House Resolution 24, cited section 603 of Jefferson's Manual, which states that \"an impeachment may be set in motion by the United States House of Representatives by charges transmitted from the legislature of a state\". In 1973, Hall had opposed a similar bill calling for the impeachment of President Richard Nixon.Hall campaigned for impeachment alongside U.S. representative Dennis Kucinich, whose campaign she supported in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Hall's bill was supported by Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg, former US attorney general Ramsey Clark, and former director of the Strategic Defense Initiative Robert M. Bowman. However, the bill also had several outspoken opponents, such as Republican state representative David Hess, who stated he had \"never seen a document more vitriolic and more inflammatory\".In February 2008, the House State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee voted 10-5 to recommend that the House not vote for the bill. In April 2008, the state house voted 227-95 to table the resolution, effectively killing the legislation. Some Democrats who voted in favor of tabling the bill, such as state representatives Ray Gagnon and Susan Almy, both of whom said they supported the bill in principle, stated that the bill would take away time that could be spent fixing everyday issues. Bernie Benn, another Democratic state representative, stated that impeachment would be too divisive.\n\nIndependent candidacies\nLater in 2008, Hall ran for the 12th district of the New Hampshire Senate as an independent candidate, despite still being a registered Democrat. Hall placed a distant third with just 10% of the vote. Democrat Peggy Gilmour won with 47% of the vote, while Republican state representative Paul LaFlamme received 43%. In 2010, Hall officially switched her party registration to independent, stating that she \"wanted to make a statement [that] neither party was doing what they should be\". That year, Hall ran as an independent candidate for the New Hampshire House of Representatives in Hillsborough County's 5th district. However, Hall placed seventh out of eight candidates, receiving just 6% of the vote in the district she formerly represented. In 2012, Hall ran as an independent candidate for the state house in Hillsborough County's 12th district. She placed last out of five candidates, receiving 10% of the vote.\n\nDeath\nHall died on April 26, 2018, of congestive heart failure in Petersburgh, New York. At the time of her death, Hall had 5 children, 12 grandchildren, and 21 great-grandchildren.\n\nTenure\nDuring her tenure with both the Republican and Democratic parties, Hall frequently challenged her party's political establishment. While in the Republican Party, Hall was seen as a member of the party's liberal wing; she was an objector to the Vietnam War and opposed an attempt to outlaw abortion, with Hall stating, \"I don't think I should legislate my religious beliefs on someone else\". While a Democrat, Hall was seen as a firebrand emblematic of the party's grassroots base, challenging the Democratic establishment by opposing Buckley in 2007 and leading the attempt to impeach Bush. Hall was described as \"a giant among the moral compass-holders in the community\".While in the state house, Hall's primary issues were the government integrity and campaign finance reform. Hall was also an advocate for mental health issues. She served as the first president of Milford Regional Counseling Services in the 1970s, and later founded Harbor Homes, an organization that provides transitional housing for people with mental illness. In the 1960s, Hall was also the president of the Waban Association for Retarded Children.\n\nEconomy, regulation, and taxation\nIn 1989, Hall led opposition towards a bill which would introduce new regulations against gravel pit operators. However, the following week, in what was described as \"parliamentary shenanigans\", the bill was revived, amended, and passed in both chambers of the state legislature. Later in 1989, Hall sponsored a bottle bill which would have introduced a 5-cent deposit on bottles and cans in order finance recycling centers. The bill also called for bottles and cans to be recycled instead of reused. Hall sponsored a similar bill in 1979, which would have imposed a tax ranging from $25 to $9,000 a year on businesses in order to fund litter control and recycling.In 1990, New Hampshire's economy collapsed and the state fell heavily into debt. Hall opposed a bill which would order the state to repay all of its bills within 30 days, stating that it didn't solve the problem and \"would only make us think we're doing something\". Hall also opposed a budget which would marginally cut spending and levy small taxes, such as a 4-cent cigarette tax and a 5% phone tax, stating that \"cutting 10 percent and 20 percent isn't going to do. Nickel and dime taxes aren't going to do it either\". She was instead supportive of the legislature stepping back and allow the governor to \"reduce spending any way he could\". Hall had previously opposed the state budget in 1979 due to the inclusion of a 1-cent gas tax. In 2007, Hall supported legislation pushed by the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative which would \"reduce carbon pollution from power plants, lower energy bills and strengthen our economy\".\n\nEducation\nThroughout her career, Hall supported the breaking up of cooperative school districts. Cooperative school districts, known as school administrative units (SAUs), were school districts consisting of multiple towns. Hall said that wealthier, smaller towns would be forced to disproportionately fund an SAU when grouped with poorer, larger towns. She also said the small towns were effectively trapped in the SAU as long as the larger towns were able to out-vote the smaller towns.In 1971, Hall sponsored legislation which would establish a volunteer corps to provide assistance and counseling to minors who violated the law. In 1973, she sponsored a bill which would create a scholarship program for college students from New Hampshire. After a first attempt failed in the House, the bill was amended to apply only to students attending in-state colleges. The program would provide matching funds for college students: the state would allocate 25 cents for every dollar given by a private scholarship. During her 2008 state senate campaign, Hall stated that she opposed funding education from property taxes, instead supporting a \"pay-as-you-go\" model.\n\nGovernment integrity and reform\nIn 1972, Hall supported an election reform bill which would restrict candidates from working in polling places in which their name was on the ballot. She was the only representative from a small town to support the bill. Introduced by state representative Chris Spirou, the bill had public support, but faced heavy opposition in the House after being \"verbally beaten into the ground by many state representatives from small towns who double as election officials in their home communities\". In her support for the bill, Hall said that it could allow for more people to become involved in the political process.\nWhile with Common Cause in 1977, Hall supported a state ethics commission to watch over the state legislature, stating that at the time New Hampshire was the only state that didn't have conflict-of-interest legislation. In 1979, Hall supported a rule change in the state house that would require all members of the House to list their sources of income. In the mid-2000s, Hall stated her concerned with the outsourcing of New Hampshire's vote counting systems to private companies, citing security and integrity concerns. In 2006, Hall proposed a bill which would make primary and general election days a state holiday. The same year, Hall supported a rules change in the state house which would end segregated party seating, which she said increased partisanship by keeping members of opposing parties separated from each other. During her independent candidacies, Hall also advocated for elections to be publicly funded in order to limit the effects of corporate influence on elections. Due to her work on campaign finance reform, Hall was frequently compared to Doris Haddock, who she was friends with, and with whom she collaborated on election reform issues with.\n\nNotes\nPassage 2:\nWilliam Worthington (actor)\nWilliam Worthington (April 8, 1872 in Troy, New York \u2013 April 9, 1941 in Beverly Hills, California) was an American silent film actor and director.\n\nCareer\nWorthington became interested in the performing arts when he began his career as an opera singer and stage actor. He entered films with a lead role in 1913, and one of his more notable films was Damon and Pythias in 1914. From 1917 to 1925, William concentrated on directing films and was the head of a film production firm called Multicolor, which was bought by Cinecolor in 1932. He was active in films up until his death in 1941.\n\nFilmography\nActor\nDirector\nSee also\nMulticolor\nPassage 3:\nWild Child (film)\nWild Child is a 2008 teen comedy film directed by Nick Moore and starring Emma Roberts, Natasha Richardson, Shirley Henderson, Alex Pettyfer and Aidan Quinn, with Georgia King, Kimberley Nixon, Juno Temple, Linzey Cocker and Sophie Wu. Roberts portrays Poppy Moore, a wealthy and spoiled American teenager who is sent to a boarding school in England by her widowed father, where she soon learns the true meaning of life and friendship. This was Richardson's final film role before her death the following year.\n\nPlot\nPoppy Moore, a wealthy but spoiled and rebellious teenager from Malibu, California, damages and discards the belongings of her widowed father's new girlfriend, Rosemary. She grabs a handful of Rosemary's clothes and jumps into the ocean just as her furious father, Gerry, arrives. Gerry announces he will be sending Poppy to Abbey Mount, a boarding school in England, in the hopes that attending the school will turn her life around. When Poppy arrives at Abbey Mount, she is warmly greeted by the headmistress Mrs. Kingsley, and later the head girl, Harriet Bentley, who is disgusted by her sense of entitlement. Poppy learns to her dismay that the bedrooms are communal and is introduced to Kate, Josie, Kiki and Jennifer, also known as \"Drippy\". She is initially hostile towards her new roommates upon meeting them, and her behaviour gets them into trouble when she insults the Matron, who confiscates their cellphones and gives them three weeks of detention.\nWhen Kate asks Poppy about her mother, she reveals that she died in a car crash when Poppy was eleven years old. Kate lets Poppy use her actual cellphone to message her friend from back home, Ruby, who is secretly cheating with Poppy's boyfriend, Roddy. The girls decide to help Poppy get expelled from Abbey Mount by carrying out several pranks, which gradually brings them closer together. When none of their plans work, they decide to have Poppy seduce Mrs. Kingsley's son, Freddie, who is forbidden from fraternizing with the female students. After the girls go shopping at a charity shop, they take Poppy to a hair salon for a makeover, where hairdresser Mr. Christopher removes her blonde hair dye and reveals her natural brunette hair. At the school dance, Freddie rejects Harriet in favour of dancing with Poppy, much to Harriet's dismay. Poppy trips on the dancefloor and Freddie takes her outside for fresh air, where he asks her out on a date. \nThe next day, Poppy discovers her newfound talent for lacrosse and becomes the team's new captain. After several weeks of practicing and improving their skills, the team advances to the finals for the first time since 1976. Finding themselves falling in love with one another, Poppy and Freddie go for a drive in the countryside, where Freddie takes Poppy out for lunch and they kiss. Poppy returns to school only to find her roommates reading an email allegedly written by her, suggesting she was pretending to be friends with them so she could get herself expelled and return to Malibu. Poppy claims she did not write the emails, but the girls refuse to listen and walk out on her. When Freddie receives a similar email, Poppy tries to explain herself, but he slams the door in her face. With no one else to turn to, Poppy sneaks into the kitchen and calls Ruby, who accidentally reveals her affair with Roddy and hangs up on her. \nFeeling even more alone, Poppy starts playing with her lighter and accidentally sets a curtain on fire. Hearing footsteps, she quickly puts out the fire and runs back to her bedroom, but a few minutes later, Drippy sees the curtains engulfed in flames and is locked inside the freezer. When Poppy is awoken by the sound of an explosion, she looks out the window and sees the fire growing and immediately wakes the school. When everyone realizes Drippy is missing, Poppy runs into the burning school to rescue her. After the fire is extinguished, Freddie finds her lighter and gives it back to her, refusing to hear any explanation. Realizing she no longer wants to leave, Poppy writes an apology letter to Freddie and later goes to Mrs. Kingsley's office to take the blame for the fire. Afterwards, she finds a portrait of her late mother in the 1976 Abbey Mount lacrosse team and begins to cry upon realizing her mother had attended the school. \nWhile Poppy waits for the Honour Court to decide whether or not she should be expelled, Freddie finds her crying and becomes convinced the fire was an accident, and forgives her. Meanwhile, Drippy reads aloud Poppy's diary, revealing how much Poppy likes her roommates, and Kiki discovers who actually wrote the emails. At the hearing, Poppy gives her testimony and Harriet is determined to prove her guilt, while Poppy's roommates arrive and begin whispering to the other girls. When they all stand up in support of Poppy, Harriet bursts into a tirade and mentions Poppy's lighter. The girls realize that no lighter was ever mentioned and Mrs. Kingsley questions how Harriet knew about the lighter. When Poppy deduces that Harriet was responsible, Harriet snaps at her and accidentally confesses to restarting the fire after Poppy had put it out. A furious Mrs. Kingsley demands to see Harriet in her office and Poppy is absolved. \nAt the lacrosse finals, Gerry arrives and is taken aback by Poppy's dramatic change in personality and how much she resembles her mother. Abbey Mount wins the lacrosse championship and Poppy, who admits that her father did the right thing by enrolling her at the school, reconciles with him. The next morning, Harriet is expelled and prepares to leave with her father, but not before Harriet's former friends toss her dead pheasants out the window and onto her. Several months later, Poppy and Freddie have resumed their relationship, and she invites her roommates to a pool party at her Malibu mansion. When Freddie notices Ruby trying to call Poppy, she ignores her, now well aware she is not a real friend, and the girls prepare to jump into the ocean.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe interiors of the boarding school were filmed at Cobham Hall in Kent.

Universal had planned a North American release in the summer of 2009, but canceled it and chose to release the film directly to DVD.\n\nCritical response\nWild Child has a 41% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 27 reviews with an average rating of 4.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"More mild than wild. This tween comedy mess falls flat on its face due to poor characters, poor direction and poor jokes\". The Sun Online gave the film 2/5 saying \"WILD? More like mild, unless you think short skirts and 'horse face' put-downs are outrageous.\" Urban Cinefile gave Wild Child a much more favourable review, stating \"The film has an energy and honesty about it: it's lively, funny and smart and the characters are appealing.\"\nRating the film 2 out of 5 stars, The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw deemed the film's story and characters \"amiable enough, but still a bit tame\" compared to films such as Clueless and Freaky Friday. Describing Wild Child as \"A tweenie comedy with an uplifting American-style sports movie awkwardly bolted on\", David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph considered the film to be \"a mess\" with predictable plot twists and inferior to the film Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging. In a mostly positive review for Variety, Leslie Felperin wrote that Dahl's script \"puts more emphasis on character development and plot mechanics than the recent, slapstick-laden, girls\u2019-school-set \"St. Trinian's,\" and still manages to have funnier one-liners\". Felperin also found that the film's \"third-act endorsement of female friendship turns out to be surprisingly affecting, despite obvious sentimentality.\" Meanwhile, Jack Wilson of The Age took a different view of the characters' development, finding that Dahl's screenplay \"dwells unpleasantly on cruelty and humiliation, and finally Poppy does little more than exchange one form of snobbery for another.\"\n\nDVD release\nWild Child was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on 8 December 2008. In Australia, it was released on 15 January 2009. In the United States, it was released directly to DVD on 17 November 2009.\n\nSoundtrack\nWild Child: The Movie Soundtrack Party Album is a soundtrack album by the film of the same name, released in the United Kingdom and Australia on 18 August 2008.

Galt is on his way to foreclose on a very promising oilfield built up by Jim Hallet (Gordon Oliver). Creed, on the other hand, wants to offer Hallet enough money to pay off his loan from Galt (for a tidy share of the oilfield).\nCreed is annoyed when his reserved compartment is appropriated by General Chow Fu-Shan (Vladimir Sokoloff). The general is on his way to deal with self-styled General Wu Yen Fang (Boris Karloff), a warlord who has taken control of a province. However, Chow Fu-Shan is assassinated on the train by one of Fang's men.\nAfter being questioned by military governor General Ma (Tetsu Komai), the three travel by horse to a remote town, where they find not only Hallet (Gordon Oliver), but Creed's estranged wife Jane (Beverly Roberts), who is working for missionary Dr. Abernathy (Gordon Hart). Then, Fang's subordinate, Captain Kung Nui (Chester Gan) and his men take over the town. When Kung Nui casts his eyes on Jane, Hallet impulsively punches him. Jane and Hallet have fallen in love, though she does not believe in divorce and has kept their relationship strictly platonic. Hallet is knocked out and imprisoned.\nWhen Fang arrives, he tries to persuade Jane to go with him, promising she would enjoy it (blithely explaining \"I am Fang\"). Hallet escapes with the help of an associate disguised as one of Fang's soldiers, and sends him to notify General Ma of Fang's whereabouts. Hallet then breaks in on Fang and Jane's private discussion. Fang remembers Hallet, who once hid a coolie and dug three bullets out of his shoulder; that was Fang before his meteoric rise. The warlord decides to help his benefactor. Fang robs Creed of $50,000, uses it to pay Galt what Hallet owes, then takes the money and offers it to Dr. Abernathy.\nCreed bribes Captain Kung Nui to rebel against Fang. Kung Nui wants to regain face by having Hallet executed. Fang pretends to give in, but just before a firing squad shoots the oilman, Fang has his right-hand man, Mr. Cheng (Richard Loo), kill Kung Nui. Afterward, Fang personally shoots Creed to fix Hallet's romantic problem, but only manages to wound him.\nGovernment troops arrive and force their way into the town. In the confusion, Jane, accompanied by Hallet, goes to attend to her husband's wound. Creed produces a gun and announces that Hallet is going to have a fatal accident, but is killed by Fang.\nWith the battle lost, Fang decides to surrender rather than risk the lives of his captives by fighting to the end. He is taken out and shot.\n\nCast\nBoris Karloff as General Wu Yen Fang\nBeverly Roberts as Mrs. Jane Creed\nRicardo Cortez as Gordon Creed\nGordon Oliver as Jim Hallet\nSheila Bromley as Lola Galt\nDouglas Wood as Myron Galt\nVladimir Sokoloff as General Chow Fu-Shan\nGordon Hart as Dr. Abernathy\nRichard Loo as Mr. Cheng\nChester Gan as Captain Kung Nui\nTetsu Komai as General Ma\n\nProduction\nThis was the second film John Farrow directed for Warner Bros.\nKarloff was to make Black Widow for Warner Bros.

Karloff's makeup required three hours of work per day; this was less time than was required for his non-human roles.\n\nReception\nThe New York Times wrote Karloff \"admirably acquits himself as a comedian\" in the film which nonetheless had \"atmospheric validity\" due to \"numerous Chinese extras and an imaginative treatment of sets.\"\n\nSee also\nBoris Karloff filmography\nPassage 7:\nJohn Chaffey\nJohn Chaffey is an English osteopathic doctor and former child film actor.\n\nFilm career\nChaffey was featured in many television adverts as a child.

    "Passage 1:\nHenry, Lord Paulet\nLord Henry Paulet (1602\u20131672) was an English courtier who sat briefly in the House of Commons in the 2nd Parliament of Charles I, from February to June 1626. \nPaulet was a son of William Paulet, 4th Marquess of Winchester. On 6 March 1618, he was admitted to Peterhouse, Cambridge. He was created Knight of the Bath at the Coronation of Charles I and was of Amport, Hampshire. In 1626, he was elected as one of the two members of parliament for Andover.Paulet married Lucy Philpot, a daughter of Sir George Philpot. Their son Francis was the grandfather of the twelfth Marquess of Winchester.\nPassage 2:\nLewis Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Huntly\nLewis Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Huntly (c. 1626\u20131653) was a Scottish nobleman.\nHe was the third son of George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly.\n\nBiography\nBorn when his father was commander of the Garde \u00c9cossaise, he was named after Louis XIII of France, and brought up until the age of ten by his grandfather, George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly. From an early age, he showed himself to be a reckless romantic \u2013 while still a child, he stole some jewels and attempted to take ship to Holland, presumably to join the army. When he was thirteen, the First Bishops' War broke out, and the young nobleman sneaked out of Gordon Castle (one account says he climbed over the wall) and hurried to the Highlands, where he raised a brigade of clansmen from his father's estates to fight the Covenanters. His first experience of war was at Megray Hill, where his Highlanders scattered in the face of enemy cannon fire.\nFollowing the peace, Lord Lewis travelled to France, where he enlisted as an ordinary pikeman in an infantry regiment, in order to learn his soldiering from the ground up. After three years, he traveled to England, working his way north by serving on both sides in the English Civil War, first in the royalist army and then in the Scottish Covenanter forces of his uncle, the Earl of Argyll, the same army he had fought against in 1639.\nEventually returning home, the sixteen-year-old nobleman seduced and married the fianc\u00e9e of his absent elder brother, Viscount Aboyne. He served on both sides in the Scottish Civil War, playing an important role in his father's occupation of Aberdeen in 1646, where he engaged an enemy cavalry commander in single combat and then storming the town. Going into exile after the defeat of the royalists, he traveled again to France; in rapid succession, he succeeded his brother and father as Earl of Enzie and Marquess of Gordon, and by 1651, he was allowed to return to Scotland, even though he refused to conform to the Presbyterian Church of Scotland (he was probably a Roman Catholic).\nIn 1645 Lord Lewis attacked Brodie Castle in Moray and setting it afire destroyed important archives and documents detailing the origins of the illustrious Clan Brodie. This despicable act secured Clan Brodie's place among the great mysteries of Scotland.\nHe died aged 26 or 27, leaving a young widow (whom he had apparently converted to Catholicism), three daughters, and a four-year-old son who would eventually become the 1st Duke of Gordon. Miles Gourdon, a cavalry commander in the French army known as the chevalier or count of \"Crolis\", was perhaps an illegitimate son, as he is said to have been a brother of the duke.His reputation among historians has varied; he is the clearest hero in the Civil War narrative of his kinsman Patrick Gordon of Ruthven, while John Buchan regarded him as wild and headstrong to the point of insanity.\nPassage 3:\nChristopher Lambert (MP)\nChristopher Lambert, of Winchester, Hampshire, was an English politician.\nHe was the second son of William Lambert of Winchester and a servant of Sir William Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester.\nLambert was a Member of Parliament for Bridport in 1593.\nPassage 4:\nWilliam Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester\nWilliam Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester  (c.\u20091532 \u2013 24 November 1598) was an English nobleman, the son of John Paulet, 2nd Marquess of Winchester and his first wife, Elizabeth Willoughby.

Among his siblings was Maj Lord Alexander Kennedy, Lord John Kennedy, Lady Julia Alice Kennedy, Lady Evelyn Anne Kennedy, and Lady Constance Eleanor Kennedy.His father was the eldest son of Archibald Kennedy, Earl of Cassilis, himself the oldest son of Archibald Kennedy, 1st Marquess of Ailsa.  His mother was the second daughter of Sir Richard Jephson, 1st Baronet and the former Charlotte Rochfort Smith.\n\nCareer\nAs a young man, he served as an officer in the Coldstream Guards. In 1885, he founded the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company, which was based in Troon and Ayr, Ayrshire.\n\nPeerage\nUpon the death of his father on 20 March 1870, he succeeded to the titles of 14th Earl of Cassilis, 16th Lord Kennedy, 3rd Marquess of Ailsa and 3rd Baron Ailsa. Along with the title came 76,000 acres in Ayrshire. He held the office of Lord-Lieutenant of Ayrshire between 1919 and 1937.\n\nPersonal life\nLord Ailsa was twice married. His first marriage took place on 7 March 1871 to Hon. Evelyn Stuart, daughter of Charles Stuart, 12th Lord Blantyre and Lady Evelyn Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (herself a daughter of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland).

He had his own shipyard at Culzean Castle, where he built the 5-ton Cocker.\nPassage 7:\nRichard Paulet, 17th Marquess of Winchester\nRichard Charles Paulet, 17th Marquess of Winchester (born on 8 July 1905; died 5 March 1968) was the son of Charles Standish Paulet and Lillian Jane Charlotte Fosbery. He was the great-grandson of Lord Charles Paulet, a younger son of the 13th Marquess. He inherited the title from Henry Paulet, 16th Marquess of Winchester, in 1962. He died unmarried, and the title was passed to his cousin Nigel Paulet, 18th Marquess of Winchester.\nPassage 8:\nWilliam Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester\nWilliam Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester  (c. 1483/1485 \u2013 10 March 1572), styled Lord St John between 1539 and 1550 and Earl of Wiltshire between 1550 and 1551, was an English Lord High Treasurer, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and statesman.\n\nFamily origins and early career in Hampshire\nPaulet was the eldest son of Sir John Paulet (1460 \u2013 5 January 1525) of Basing Castle in the parish of Old Basing, near Basingstoke in Hampshire, and of Nunney Castle in Somerset (inherited from the Delamere family in 1415), a cadet branch of Paulet of Hinton St George in Somerset. His mother Alice Paulet was his father's second cousin-once-removed the daughter of Sir William Paulet by his wife Elizabeth Denebaud. William had six siblings, including Sir George Paulet of Crondall Manor in Hampshire and Eleanor Paulet (born 1479), wife of William Giffard of Itchell Manor at Ewshot, also in Hampshire.\nThe family originated at the manor of Paulet (now Pawlett), near Bridgwater in Somerset. The senior branch of the Paulet/Powlet/Poulett family was seated at Hinton St George in Somerset, and had lived in that county since the early thirteenth century; the first Member of Parliament from that line represented Devon in 1385.There is some disagreement over his date of birth, with different authorities quoting 1483 or 1485. A claim that he was ninety-seven at his death would place his birth in 1474 or 1475. There is also uncertainty about where he was born, but it may have been at Fisherton Delamere in Wiltshire, one of his father's manors.His father, who had held a command against the Cornish rebels in 1497, was the head of the branch seated at Paulet and Road, close to Bridgwater, being the son of John Paulet and Elizabeth Roos. William's great-grandfather John Paulet acquired the Hampshire estates by his marriage with Constance Poynings, granddaughter and coheiress of Thomas Poynings, 5th Baron St John of Basing; his barony became abeyant upon his death in 1428/1429.\nWilliam Paulet was High Sheriff of Hampshire in 1512, 1519, 1523, and again in 1527. Knighted before the end of 1525, he was appointed Master of the King's Wards in November 1526 and appeared in the Privy Council in the same year.\n\nMarriage and issue\nHe married Elizabeth (d. 25 December 1558), daughter of Sir William Capel, Lord Mayor of London in 1503, and by her had four sons and four daughters:\nJohn Paulet, 2nd Marquess of Winchester\nThomas\nChidiock Paulet (also spelled Chidiok, Chediok, Chidieok, or Chidiock), governor of Southampton under Mary and Elizabeth\nGiles\nAlice, married Richard Stawell, of Cotherston, Somerset\nMargaret, married Sir William Berkeley\nMargery, married Sir Richard Waller, of Oldstoke, Hampshire\nEleanor (died 26 September 1558), married Sir Richard Pecksall (died 1571) of Beaurepaire, Hampshire, hereditary Master of the Buckhounds.\n\nCareer as a national statesman\nDuring his long career Paulet held numerous offices, which included:\nHigh Sheriff of Hampshire 1511\u201312, 1518\u201319 and 1522\u201323\nJoint Master of the King's Wards 1526\u201334 and sole Master of the King's Wards 1534\u201340\nMember of Parliament for Hampshire 1529\u201336\nComptroller of the Household 1532\u201337\nKeeper of Pamber Forest 1535/6\nTreasurer of the Household 1537\u201338/9\nMaster of the King's Woods 1541\nMaster of the Court of Wards 1540\u201342\nMaster of the Court of Wards and Liveries 1542\u201354\nPrivy Counsellor 1542\nLord Chamberlain of the Household 1543\u201345\nLord Steward of the Household 1545-1549/50\nChief Justice in Eyre, South of Trent 1545\u201349/50\nLord President of the Council 1546\u201349\nJoint Governor of King Edward VI\nLord Keeper of the Great Seal 1547\nKeeper and Captain of St Andrew's Castle, Hamble 1547\u201371/2\nKeeper of Alice Holt and Woolmer Forests 1548\u201371/2\nLord High Treasurer 1549/50\u201371/2\nLord High Steward for the trial of the Duke of Somerset 1551\nLord Lieutenant of Hampshire 1552, 1553 and 1559\nLieutenant of the forces in London 1558\nSpeaker of the House of Lords 1558 and 1566\nLord Lieutenant of Hampshire and Middlesex 1569\nJoint Lord Lieutenant of London 1569Paulet's political career began in 1529, when he was elected knight of the shire for Hampshire. In 1532, he accompanied King Henry VIII to Calais, France, and the following spring, he accompanied the Duke of Norfolk to join King Francis I of France in a proposed audience with the Pope, to discuss Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon. In 1536, he was granted the keepership of Pamber Forest, and on 9 March 1539 was created Baron St John. He became steward of the bishopric of Winchester, and became a close associate of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey and a friend of Thomas Cromwell. He was also Comptroller of the Royal Household, and held many other high positions.\nIn 1535 and 1536, he served as one of the judges for the trials of John Fisher, Sir Thomas More, and the alleged accomplices of Anne Boleyn; in 1535, he became Lord Chamberlain. He partially led the royal forces against the Pilgrimage of Grace, a rebellion that broke out in the autumn of 1536, and in 1538, he became Treasurer of the Household. In 1540, he became the master of Henry's Court of Wards and Liveries, a Knight of the Garter in 1543, and Governor of Portsmouth and Lord Steward of the Household in 1545. In 1546, he became Lord President of the Council, and in 1547, he was an executor of the will of King Henry VIII.He continued his political manoeuvres in 1549 by supporting the Earl of Warwick against the Duke of Somerset\u2014in reward, on 19 January 1550 he was given the Earldom of Wiltshire and Somerset's position of Lord Treasurer. In the following month Warwick took over the post of Lord President of the Council. When Warwick was created Duke of Northumberland on 11 October 1551, Paulet received the Marquessate of Winchester. Six weeks later, he served as Lord High Steward in the Duke of Somerset's trial.\nIt was said that Northumberland and Winchester \"ruled the court\" of the minor King Edward VI. Mary I affirmed him in all of his positions. After her death, he remained Lord Treasurer and retained many of his other positions, and even at an advanced age (in 1559, he was over seventy years old), he showed no signs of declining\u2014he was Speaker of the House of Lords in 1559 and 1566. He remained in good standing with the English monarchs\u2014Queen Elizabeth once joked, \"for, by my troth, if my lord treasurer were but a young man, I could find it in my heart to have him for a husband before any man in England.\" Late in life, he opposed any military support of Continental Protestantism, as he feared it would cause a breach with strongly Catholic Spain.\nPaulet enjoyed a remarkably long career during the Reformation. Starting out as a Catholic, he was quickly persuaded to see things Henry's way once the breach with Rome had been decided on. He was rewarded with former Church properties following the dissolution of the monasteries. Under Edward VI he became an evangelical Protestant and persecuted Roman Catholics and Henrician Conservatives alike. On the accession of the Catholic Mary he announced his reconversion and commenced persecuting his former Protestant co-religionists, even denouncing Bishop Bonner for \"laxity in prosecuting the heretics.\" His wife also found favour with Mary. On Tuesday 21 August 1554, when Mary went into Westminster Abbey her train was carried by Elizabeth, Marchioness of Winchester and Anne of Cleves.On Elizabeth's succession, he once again shifted his sails and became an advocate of middle-road Anglicanism. All in all, he professed five changes in religious course. Once, when asked how he managed to survive so many storms, not only unhurt, but rising all the while, Paulet answered: \"By being a willow, not an oak\".\n\nDeath\nPaulet was still in office when he died on 10 March 1572, a very old man, at Basing House, which he held to rebuild and fortify. His tomb is on the south side of the chancel of Basing church.\nPassage 9:\nJohn Paulet, 5th Marquess of Winchester\nJohn Paulet, 5th Marquess of Winchester (c. 1598 \u2013 5 March 1675), styled Lord John Paulet until 1621 and Lord St John from 1621 to 1628, was the third but eldest surviving son of William Paulet and his successor as 5th Marquess of Winchester.\n\nLife\nHe kept terms at Exeter College, Oxford, but as a Roman Catholic could not matriculate. He sat for St Ives from 1620 to 1622. Staying away to recover his family fortune for most of the 1630s, he returned and presented himself to the court and the king in 1639. The fifth Marquess and the Queen became firm friends thereafter, and therefore his chief seat, Basing House, was the great resort of Queen Henrietta Maria's friends in southwest England.On the outbreak of the English Civil War, he fortified and garrisoned Basing House and held it for Charles I during 1643 and 1644. The siege of Basing House, notwithstanding an attempt of his youngest brother, Lord Edward Paulet, to deliver it up to the enemy, lasted from August 1643 to 16 October 1645, when, during the general decline of the Royal cause, it was taken by storm, after a determined defence, by Oliver Cromwell. The brutality with which the house was sacked was most unusual, as atrocities against civilians during the Civil War were rare and generally discouraged by both sides: the explanation may be the presence of a number of Catholic priests among the defenders. Paulet was subsequently renowned as a great loyalist.The Marquess was made prisoner with such of his garrison as survived the fight; ten pieces of ordnance and much ammunition were also taken by the victors, as Oliver Cromwell himself, who directed the assault, wrote to the Speaker.He was committed to the Tower of London on a charge of high treason in 1645, where he remained a long time; an order was made for allowing him 5l. a week out of his property on 15 Jan 1646. Lady Winchester, who had escaped from Basing two days before its fall, was sent to join her husband in the Tower on 31 Jan, and a weekly sum of 10l., afterwards increased to 15l., was ordered to be paid her for the support of herself and her children, with the stipulation that the latter were to be educated as Protestants. An ordinance for the sale of Winchester's land was passed on 30 Oct, and by the act of 16 July 1651, a portion was sold by the trustees for the sale of forfeited estates. On 7 September 1647 Winchester was allowed to drink the waters at Epsom, and stayed there by permission of parliament for nearly six months. The House of Lords on 30 June 1648 urged the commons to release him on bail in consideration of his bad health. In the propositions sent to the king at the Isle of Wight on 13 October, it was expressly stipulated that Winchester's name be excepted from pardon. Ultimately the commons resolved on 14 March 1649 not to proceed against him for high treason, but they ordered him to be detained in prison and excepted from any composition for his estate. In January 1656 he was a prisoner in execution in the upper bench for debts amounting to 2,000l., and he petitioned Cromwell for relief. The sale of his lands was discontinued by order of parliament on 15 March 1660, and after the Restoration Winchester received them back. It was proposed on 3 August 1660 to recompense him for his losses to the amount of 19,000l. and damages, subsequently reduced to 10,000l., and this was agreed to on 2 July 1661. In the event he was allowed to go unrecompensed at the Restoration of the Monarchy, but regained his lands.\n\nMarriages and issue\nHe married as his first wife:\nJane Savage, daughter of Thomas Savage, 1st Viscount Savage of Rocksavage, on 18 December 1622, and by her had a son:Charles Paulet, 1st Duke of Bolton, born c. 1630\nJane died in childbirth in 1631, prompting an epitaph by John MiltonHe married as his second wife:\n\nHonora de Burgh, born c. 1605, daughter of Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricarde and Frances Walsingham, in around 1645 and by her, had a daughter:Anne, died c. September 1694, married John Belasyse, 1st Baron BelasyseHe married as his third wife:\n\nIsabel Howard, daughter of William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford and Mary Stafford, sister of the 5th Baron Stafford, in 1669.\n\nDeath\nHe retired to Englefield House in Berkshire, which was a wedding gift from his second marriage to Lady Honora de Burgh in the early 1630s. He died on 5 March 1674 and was buried at Englefield, Berkshire. Paulet was succeeded, by his eldest son, Charles Paulet, as 6th Marquess of Winchester, later created 1st Duke of Bolton. Charles converted to the Church of England, a great blow to the Roman Catholic community of Hampshire, who had for many years looked to the Paulet family to shield them from the worst rigours of the Penal Laws.\n\nFootnotes\nAttribution This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain: \"The Genealogy of the Existing British Peerage\" by Edmund Lodge (1859)\n This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain: Goodwin, Gordon (1895). \"Paulet, John\" .

    "Passage 1:\nEdward Watson, Viscount Sondes\nEdward Watson, Viscount Sondes (3 July 1686 \u2013 20 March 1722) of Lees Court, Sheldwich, Kent, and Park Place, London, was a British Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1708 and 1722.Watson was the eldest son of Lewis Watson, 1st Earl of Rockingham and Catherine Sondes, daughter of George Sondes, 1st Earl of Feversham. He matriculated at Merton College, Oxford on 1 June 1703, aged 16 and travelled abroad to Germany in 1707.Watson arrived back from Germany in 1708, in time to be elected as a Whig Member of Parliament for Canterbury at the 1708 British general election. He proposed a motion on 25 January 1709 for an address to the Queen that she should consider remarrying. He also supported the naturalization of the Palatines. He was appointed to a committee to draft a bill to limit the time allowed for public mourning, since this  was felt to be having an  adverse effect on Canterbury's silk trade. He also voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell and possibly in consequence he lost his seat at the 1710 British general election. He was returned unopposed as MP for New Romney at a by-election on 20 April 1713. Following his father's elevation as Earl of Rockingham in 1714, he was styled Viscount Sondes.

He was the grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nEarly life\nHis father was Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf,:\u200a81\u200a the progenitor of the distinguished Banu Hashim, a clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. They claimed descent from Ism\u0101'\u012bl and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. His mother was Salma bint Amr, from the Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj tribe in Yathrib (later called Madinah). Hashim died while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born.:\u200a81\u200aHis real name was \"Shaiba\" meaning 'the ancient one' or 'white-haired' because of the streak of white through his jet-black hair, and is sometimes also called Shaybah al-\u1e24amd (\"The white streak of praise\").:\u200a81\u201382\u200a After his father's death he was raised in Yathrib with his mother and her family until about the age of eight, when his uncle Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf went to see him and asked his mother Salmah to entrust Shaybah to his care. Salmah was unwilling to let her son go and Shaiba refused to leave his mother without her consent. Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib then pointed out that the possibilities Yathrib had to offer were incomparable to Mecca. Salmah was impressed with his arguments, so she agreed to let him go. Upon first arriving in Mecca, the people assumed the unknown child was Muttalib's servant and started calling him 'Abd al-Muttalib (\"servant of Muttalib\").:\u200a85\u201386\n\nChieftain of Hashim clan\nWhen Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib died, Shaiba succeeded him as the chief of the H\u0101shim clan. Following his uncle Al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, he took over the duties of providing the pilgrims with food and water, and carried on the practices of his forefathers with his people. He attained such eminence as none of his forefathers enjoyed; his people loved him and his reputation was great among them.:\u200a61\u200a\n'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b's grandfather Nufayl ibn Abdul Uzza arbitrated in a dispute between 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib and \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, Abu Sufyan's father, over the custodianship of the Kaaba. Nufayl gave his verdict in favour of 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib. Addressing \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, he said:\nWhy do you pick a quarrel with a person who is taller than you in stature; more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in lustre? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good qualities which I highly appreciate. You are as gentle as a lamb, you are renowned throughout Arabia for the stentorian tones of your voice, and you are an asset to your tribe.\n\nDiscovery of Zam Zam Well\n'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib said that while sleeping in the sacred enclosure, he had dreamed he was ordered to dig at the worship place of the Quraysh between the two deities Is\u0101f and N\u0101'ila. There he would find the Zamzam Well, which the Jurhum tribe had filled in when they left Mecca. The Quraysh tried to stop him digging in that spot, but his son Al-\u1e24\u0101rith stood guard until they gave up their protests. After three days of digging, 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib found traces of an ancient religious well and exclaimed, \"Allahuakbar!\" Some of the Quraysh disputed his claim to sole rights over water, then one of them suggested that they go to a female shaman who lived afar. It was said that she could summon jinns and that she could help them decide who was the owner of the well. So, 11 people from the 11 tribes went on the expedition. They had to cross the desert to meet the priestess but then they got lost. There was a lack of food and water and people started to lose hope of ever getting out. One of them suggested that they dig their own graves and if they died, the last person standing would bury the others. So all began digging their own graves and just as Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib started digging, water spewed out from the hole he dug and everyone became overjoyed. It was then and there decided that Abdul-Muttalib was the owner of the Zam Zam well. Thereafter he supplied pilgrims to the Kaaba with Zam Zam water, which soon eclipsed all the other wells in Mecca because it was considered sacred.:\u200a86\u201389\u200a:\u200a62\u201365\n\nThe Year of the Elephant\nAccording to Muslim tradition, the Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abrahah al-Ashram, envied the Kaaba's reverence among the Arabs and, being a Christian, he built a cathedral on Sana'a and ordered pilgrimage be made there.:\u200a21\u200a The order was ignored and someone desecrated (some saying in the form of defecation:\u200a696 note 35\u200a) the cathedral. Abrahah decided to avenge this act by demolishing the Kaaba and he advanced with an army towards Mecca.:\u200a22\u201323\u200aThere were thirteen elephants in Abrahah's army:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a26\u200a and the year came to be known as '\u0100m al-F\u012bl (the Year of the Elephant), beginning a trend for reckoning the years in Arabia which was used until 'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b replaced it with the Islamic Calendar in 638 CE (17 AH), with the first year of the Islamic Calendar being 622 CE.\nWhen news of the advance of Abrahah's army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kin\u0101nah, Khuz\u0101'ah and Hudhayl united in defence of the Kaaba. A man from the \u1e24imyar tribe was sent by Abrahah to advise them that he only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. \"Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the nearest high hills while he, with some leading members of Quraysh, remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abrahah sent a dispatch inviting 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib to meet him and discuss matters. When 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonour the servants of His House.\":\u200a24\u201326\u200aIt is recorded that when Abrahah's forces neared the Kaaba, Allah commanded small birds (ab\u0101b\u012bl) to destroy Abrahah's army, raining down pebbles on it from their beaks. Abrahah was seriously wounded and retreated towards Yemen but died on the way.:\u200a26\u201327\u200a This event is referred to in the following Qur'anic chapter:\n\nHave you not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant?\nDid He not make their treacherous plan go astray?\n\nAnd He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, so He rendered them like straw eaten up.\nMost Islamic sources place the event around the year that Muhammad was born, 570 CE, though other scholars place it one or two decades earlier. A tradition attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the musannaf of \u02bdAbd al-Razzaq al-San\u02bdani places it before the birth of Muhammad's father.\n\nSacrificing his son Abdullah\nAl-Harith was 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's only son at the time he dug the Zamzam Well.:\u200a64\u200a When the Quraysh tried to help him in the digging, he vowed that if he were to have ten sons to protect him, he would sacrifice one of them to Allah at the Kaaba. Later, after nine more sons had been born to him, he told them he must keep the vow. The divination arrows fell upon his favourite son Abdullah. The Quraysh protested 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's intention to sacrifice his son and demanded that he sacrifice something else instead. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib agreed to consult a \"sorceress with a familiar spirit\". She told him to cast lots between Abdullah and ten camels. If Abdullah were chosen, he had to add ten more camels, and keep on doing the same until his Lord accepted the camels in Abdullah's place. When the number of camels reached 100, the lot fell on the camels. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib confirmed this by repeating the test three times. Then the camels were sacrificed, and Abdullah was spared.:\u200a66\u201368\n\nFamily\nWives\nAbd al-Muttalib had six known wives.\n\nSumra bint Jundab of the Hawazin tribe.\nLubn\u0101 bint H\u0101jar of the Khuza'a tribe.\nFatima bint Amr of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nHalah bint Wuhayb of the Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nNat\u012bla bint Janab of the Namir tribe.\nMumanna'a bint Amr of the Khuza'a tribe.\n\nChildren\nAccording to Ibn Hisham, \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib had ten sons and six daughters.:\u200a707\u2013708 note 97\u200a However, Ibn Sa'd lists twelve sons.:\u200a99\u2013101\u200aBy Sumra bint Jundab:\n\nAl-\u1e24\u0101rith.:\u200a708\u200a He was the firstborn and he died before his father.:\u200a99\u200a\nQuthum.:\u200a100\u200a He is not listed by Ibn Hisham.By Fatima bint Amr:\n\nAl-Zubayr.:\u200a707\u200a He was a poet and a chief; his father made a will in his favour.:\u200a99\u200a He died before Islam, leaving two sons and daughters.:\u200a101\u200a:\u200a34\u201335\u200a\nAbu Talib, born as Abd Manaf,:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a707\u200a father of the future Caliph Ali.

One day Muhammad's mother, Amina, wanted to go to Yathrib, where her husband, Abdullah, died. So, Muhammad, Amina, Abd al-Muttalib and their caretaker, Umm Ayman started their journey to Medina, which is around 500 kilometres away from Makkah. They stayed there for three weeks, then, started their journey back to Mecca. But, when they reached halfway, at Al-Abwa', Amina became very sick and died six years after her husband's death. She was buried over there. From then, Muhammad became an orphan. Abd al-Muttalib became very sad for Muhammad because he loved him so much. Abd al-Muttalib took care of Muhammad. But when Muhammad was eight years old, the very old Abd al-Muttalib became very sick and died at age 81-82 in 578-579 CE.\nShaybah ibn H\u0101shim's grave can be found in the Jannat al-Mu'all\u0101 cemetery in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nSee also\nFamily tree of Muhammad\nFamily tree of Shaiba ibn Hashim\nSahaba\nPassage 10:\nKevin Watson\nKevin Edward Watson (born 3 January 1974) is a former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. After his retirement from playing, he turned non-league coach.\n\nPlaying career\nWatson started his career as a trainee with his local side Tottenham Hotspur. Watson scored his only Spurs goal on his debut in a League Cup tie against Brentford. As a youngster his first-team opportunities were limited and he went out on loan to several sides to build his experience, namely Brentford, Bristol City and Barnet.\nIn 1996, he was signed by Swindon Town manager Steve McMahon. Newly promoted to second tier of the English Football League \u2013 Watson helped them avoid relegation.\nWatson moved on to Rotherham United in July 1999, astute Millers' manager Ronnie Moore signing him on a free transfer. In his first season Watson helped Rotherham to promotion from League Two, narrowly missing out on the title.\nAnother promotion (and another title near miss) followed in the next season and Rotherham were promoted again into the Football League Championship. A key part of their rapid acceleration, Watson helped guide the team to survival by the narrowest of goal-difference margins.\nAfter over 100 games at Rotherham his knack for promotions was spotted by then Reading manager Alan Pardew who at first, took Watson on loan before signing him permanently in March 2002 for \u00a3150,000 \u2013 where he promptly repeated the trick, guiding the Royals to promotion from League One, in his now customary second place.\nHis first full season at Reading saw the Royals into a play-off place, where narrow defeat to Wolves cost them a place in the Premiership. Perhaps tellingly Watson was on the bench for those key play-off games.\nWhen former teammate Phil Parkinson was installed as manager at Colchester United one of his first acts was to bring Watson to Layer Road.\nMarshalling the midfield Watson played a key role as in his (and Parkinson's) first full season the U's stormed to promotion from League One, finishing in second place.\nNow with over 100 games for the U's under his belt he has been a key part of \"The Best Col U ever\" as the underdog U's finished their first season in the Football League Championship in 10th place.\nHe was released by Colchester at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, and then signed on a free transfer for Luton Town. However, Watson failed to make an impact at Luton as a result of a knee injury that kept him out of action for much of his contract duration, and he was released at the end of 2008.\nIn 2015 whilst assistant manager of Stevenage, Watson alongside Stevenage manager Teddy Sheringham registered as players.\n\nCoaching career\nAfter his release from a playing contract at Luton, Watson was given the position of first-team coach by Luton manager Mick Harford on 14 January 2009. After Harford's departure on 1 October 2009, Watson continued in his coaching capacity under new boss Richard Money until May 2010, when he left the club.Following the departure of Aidy Boothroyd from Colchester United to take the manager's job at Coventry City on 20 May 2010, Watson expressed an interest in taking up the vacant managerial position at his former club.In May 2015 he was appointed manager of Maldon & Tiptree However, Watson left the club after only eleven days to take up the position of assistant manager to Teddy Sheringham at Stevenage. He left his position in February after Teddy Sheringham's departure. From July 2015 to November 2015, he worked at the academy of Colchester United.\nIn August 2016, Watson was appointed assistant manager at Eastleigh. In January 2017 he was appointed to the same position at Whitehawk but left the club after just two games, following a change of manager. In March 2017 he was appointed manager of Bishop's Stortford. He left the club at the end of the 2017\u201318 season.On 28 June 2018, Watson was appointed assistant manager of Hungerford Town. He left the club on 2 October to join Ebbsfleet United as a first-team coach. However, only eight days later, he was appointed caretaker after manager Gary Hill's departure. After a three-game unbeaten run the club confirmed, that Watson had been appointed to the manager's job on a permanent basis.The club was beaten in the heaviest defeat in 27 years, 7\u20130 by Barrow on 4 January and also crashed out of the FA Trophy to lower league opponents Royston. Other heavy losses such as a 4\u20130 drubbing at Chesterfield away ultimately saw the club relegated out of the National League and Watson sacked.On 7 January 2021, Watson was announced as the new manager of National League South side Billericay Town.On 5 October 2021, Watson was sacked by Billericay after Watson led them to one win and one draw from eight matches to start the season.\n\nPersonal life\nWatson has been involved in greyhound racing, pairing up with Tottenham Hotspur teammate Stuart Nethercott to buy Elegant Brandy, who won the 1995 Grand National.\n\nHonours\nRotherham United\nFootball League Division Three runner-up: 1999\u20132000\nFootball League Division Two runner-up: 2000\u201301Reading\n\nFootball League Division Two runner-up: 2001\u201302Colchester United\n\nFootball League One runner-up: 2005\u201306",
    "Passage 1:\nHenry de Bohun\nSir Henry de Bohun (died 23 June 1314) was an English knight, of Anglo-Norman origins, the grandson of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford. He was killed on the first day of the Battle of Bannockburn by Robert the Bruce.\nRiding in the vanguard of heavy cavalry, de Bohun caught sight of the Scottish king who was mounted on a small palfrey (ane gay palfray Li till and joly) armed only with a battle-axe.De Bohun lowered his lance and charged, but Bruce stood his ground, riding on towards the English knight. The two men sped towards each other (Sprent thai samyn intill a ling). At the last moment Bruce manoeuvred his mount nimbly to one side, stood up in his stirrups and hit de Bohun so hard with his axe that it cut through both Sir Henry's helmet and skull and into his brain (That ner the heid till the harnys clave). Despite the great risk the King had taken, he merely expressed regret that he had broken the shaft of his favourite axe.An iconic description and picture of the death of Henry de Bohun is contained in Scotland's Story by H. E. Marshall.\nPassage 2:\nEleanor de Bohun\nEleanor de Bohun (c.\u20091366 \u2013 3 October 1399) was the elder daughter and co-heiress (with her sister, Mary de Bohun), of  Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford (1341\u20131373) and Joan Fitzalan, a daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel and his second wife Eleanor of Lancaster.\n\nMarriage\nIn 1376, Eleanor married Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester. Thomas was the youngest son of Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. Following their marriage, the couple went to reside in Pleshey Castle, Essex. According to Jean Froissart, Eleanor and her husband had the tutelage of her younger sister, Mary, who was being instructed in religious doctrine in the hope that she would enter a convent, thus leaving her share of the considerable Bohun inheritance to Eleanor and Thomas.\n\nIssue\nTogether Eleanor and Thomas had five children:\n\nHumphrey, 2nd Earl of Buckingham (c. 1381/1382 \u2013 2 September 1399)\nAnne of Gloucester (c. 1383 \u2013 1438) married (1st) Thomas Stafford, 3rd Earl of Stafford; (2nd) Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford; and (3rd) William Bourchier, Count of Eu. Her son by 3rd marriage, John Bourchier, 1st Baron Berners, was grandfather of Richard Neville, 2nd Baron Latimer of Snape.\nJoan (1384 \u2013 16 August 1400) married Gilbert Talbot, 5th Baron Talbot (1383\u20131419). Died in childbirth.\nIsabel (12 March 1385/1386 \u2013 April 1402), became a Minoress, later abbess, in a religious house near Aldgate\nPhilippa (c. 1388) Died young\n\nOrder of the Garter\nEleanor de Bohun was made a Lady of the Garter in 1384. She became a nun sometime after 1397 at Barking Abbey. Prior to her death, Eleanor divided her holdings among her children.  She died on 3 October 1399 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Her executors included the chaplain in Pleshy, Essex.\n\nIn fiction\nEleanor appears briefly in Anya Seton's historical romance Katherine, based upon the life of Eleanor's sister-in-law Katherine Swynford, the third wife of John of Gaunt. She also appears in Act 1, Scene 2 of Shakespeare's Richard II, where she unsuccessfully urges John of Gaunt to avenge her murdered husband.\n\nNotes\nPassage 3:\nJohn de Ferrers, 1st Baron Ferrers of Chartley\nJohn de Ferrers, 1st Baron Ferrers of Chartley (20 June 1271 Cardiff \u2013 1312) was the son of Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby and Alianore de Bohun, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun and Eleanor de Braose, and granddaughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford. He was both Seneschal of Gascony and Lieutenant of Aquitaine in 1312, the year of his death.Ferrers joined the baronial opposition to King Edward in 1297, but was summoned as a baron in 1299.He married Hawise de Muscegros, a daughter of Robert de Muscegros.Their eldest son John (died by 1324) inherited the title Baron Ferrers of Chartley upon his father's death from poisoning in Gascony in 1312.\nPassage 4:\nHumphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford\nHumphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford, 6th Earl of Essex, 2nd Earl of Northampton, KG (March 25, 1342 \u2013 January 16, 1373) was the son of William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton, and Elizabeth de Badlesmere, and grandson of Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford, by Elizabeth of Rhuddlan, daughter of King Edward I. He became heir to the Earldom of Hereford after the death of his childless uncle Humphrey de Bohun, 6th Earl of Hereford.\nFollowing King Peter I's visit to England, Humphrey participated in the sack of Alexandria in 1365.His wife and the mother of his daughters was Joan Fitzalan, daughter of Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel, and Eleanor of Lancaster, whom he married after 9 September 1359.\nOn his death, his estates were inherited by his two surviving daughters and his titles went into abeyance: \n\nEleanor de Bohun (1366 - 3 October 1399); married Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, youngest son of Edward III; mother of Anne of Gloucester.\nMary de Bohun, who married Henry Bolingbroke, the future King Henry IV of England.\nElizabeth de Bohun, died young.\nPassage 5:\nJohn de Bohun, 5th Earl of Hereford\nJohn de Bohun, 5th Earl of Hereford (23 November 1306 \u2013 20 January 1336) was born in St Clement's, Oxford to Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford and Elizabeth of Rhuddlan, a daughter of Edward I of England.\nAfter his father's death at the Battle of Boroughbridge, the family lands were forfeited. It was not until after the fall of the Despensers that John was permitted to succeed to his inherited position as Earl of Hereford and Essex, hereditary Constable of England, and Lord of Brecknock.\n\nMarriages\nHe married firstly, in 1325, to Alice FitzAlan (died 1326), daughter of Edmund FitzAlan, 2nd Earl of Arundel, and secondly to Margaret Basset (died 1355). After the marriage, it was discovered that the couple were related to the fourth degree of consanguinity and they were forced to live apart. An appeal to Pope John XXII resulted on 19 February 1331 in a papal commission to the bishops of Lichfield and London to hold an enquiry into the case. However, Roger Northburgh, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, failed to act and the case was still pending when the Pope issued a further demand for an enquiry in 1334.\n\nDeath\nHe did not play much of a public role, despite his high titles and offices, most likely because he had some sort of incapacity. His younger brothers were often deputed to fulfil his duties as Constable. He died at Kirkby Thore, Westmorland and was interred in Stratford Langthorne Abbey, London.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 6:\nEleanor de Braose\nEleanor de Braose (c. 1228\u20131251) was a Cambro-Norman noblewoman and a wealthy co-heiress of her father, who was the powerful Marcher lord William de Braose, and of her mother, Eva Marshal, a co-heiress of the Earls of Pembroke. Her husband was Humphrey de Bohun, heir of the 2nd Earl of Hereford, by whom she had children, including Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford and Gilbert de Bohun.\n\nFamily\nEleanor was born in about 1228. She was the youngest of four daughters and a co-heiress of the powerful Marcher lord William de Braose, and Eva Marshal, both of whom held considerable lordships and domains in the Welsh Marches and Ireland. Eva was one of the daughters of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke by Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke, daughter of Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, \"Strongbow\". Eleanor's three sisters were Isabella de Braose, Maud de Braose, Baroness Mortimer, and Eva de Braose, wife of William de Cantelou.While Eleanor was a young girl, her father - known to the Welsh as Gwilym Ddu (Black William) - was hanged on the orders of Llewelyn the Great, Prince of Wales for alleged adultery with Llewelyn's wife, Joan, Lady of Wales. Following the execution, her mother held de Braose lands and castles in her own right.\n\nMarriage and issue\nOn an unknown date after August 1241, Eleanor became the first wife of Humphrey de Bohun, the son of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford and Maud de Lusignan. The marriage took place after the death of Humphrey's mother, Maud.Humphrey and Eleanor had the following children:\n\nHumphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford (c.1249- 31 December 1298), married Maud de Fiennes, daughter of Enguerrand II de Fiennes and Isabelle de Conde, by whom he had issue, including Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.\nGilbert de Bohun.(b.1251 - 1297) married Margarite had issue Gilbert (b.1302 d. 1381)His brother granted him Eleanor's lands in Ireland.\nEleanor de Bohun (died 20 February 1314, buried Walden Abbey). She married Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby on 26 June 1269. They had at least two sons and one daughter.\nMargery de Bohun (fl.1265 \u2013 1280) married Theobald de Verdun and had a son also Theobald de Verdun, both of whom were hereditary Constables of Ireland.Eleanor died in 1251, and was buried at Llanthony Secunda Priory. She passed on her considerable possessions in the Welsh Marches to her eldest son Humphrey. Her husband survived her, married Joan de Quincy, and died in 1265.\n\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nWilliam de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton\nWilliam de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton, KG (c. 1312 \u2013 16 September 1360) was an English nobleman and military commander.\n\nLineage\nHe was the fifth son of Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford and Elizabeth of Rhuddlan. He had a twin brother, Edward. His maternal grandparents were Edward I of England and his first wife, Queen consort Eleanor of Castile.\n\nLife\nWilliam de Bohun assisted at the arrest of Roger Mortimer in 1330, allowing Edward III to take power. After this, he was a trusted friend and commander of the king and he participated in the renewed wars with Scotland.In 1332, he received many new properties: Hinton and Spaine in Berkshire; Great Haseley, Ascott, Deddington, Pyrton and Kirtlington in Oxfordshire; Wincomb in Buckinghamshire; Longbenington in Lincolnshire; Kneesol in Nottinghamshire; Newnsham in Gloucestershire, Wix in Essex, and Bosham in Sussex.\nIn 1335, he married Elizabeth de Badlesmere (1313 \u2013 8 June 1356). Her parents Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere, and Margaret de Clare had both turned against Edward II the decade before. Elizabeth and William were granted some of the property of Elizabeth's first husband, who had also been Mortimer's son and heir.\nWilliam was created Earl of Northampton in 1337, one of the six earls created by Edward III to renew the ranks of the higher nobility. Since de Bohun was a younger son, and did not have an income suitable to his rank, he was given an annuity until suitable estates could be found.\nIn 1349 he became a Knight of the Garter. He served as High Sheriff of Rutland from 1349 until his death in 1360.\n\nCampaigns in Flanders, Brittany, Scotland, Sluys and Crecy\nIn 1339 he accompanied the King to Flanders.  He served variously in Brittany and in Scotland, and was present at the great English victories at Sluys and Cr\u00e9cy, the latter as a commander. His most stunning feat was leading an English force to victory against a much bigger French force at the Battle of Morlaix in 1342. Some of the details are in dispute, but it is clear that he made good use of pit traps, which stopped the French cavalry.\n\nDiplomat\nIn addition to being a warrior, William was also a renowned diplomat.  He negotiated two treaties with France, one in 1343 and one in 1350. He was also charged with negotiating in Scotland for the freedom of King David Bruce, King of Scots, who was held prisoner by the English.\n\nSenior naval command\nFrom the 8 March 1352 to 5 March 1355 he was appointed Admiral of the Northern Seas, Fleet.\n\nIssue\n1.

He was also an active participant in the Welsh Wars and maintained for several years a private feud with the earl of Gloucester. His father, Humphrey (V) de Bohun, fought on the side of the rebellious barons in the Barons' War. When Humphrey (V) predeceased his father, Humphrey (VI) became heir to his grandfather, Humphrey (IV). At Humphrey (IV)'s death in 1275, Humphrey (VI) inherited the earldoms of Hereford and Essex. He also inherited major possessions in the Welsh Marches from his mother, Eleanor de Braose.\nBohun spent most of his early career reconquering marcher lands captured by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd during the Welsh war in England. This was finally accomplished through Edward I's war in Wales in 1277. Hereford also fought in Wales in 1282\u201383 and 1294\u201395. At the same time he also had private feuds with other marcher lords, and his conflict with Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, eventually ended with the personal intervention of King Edward himself. Hereford's final years were marked by the opposition he and Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, mounted against the military and fiscal policy of Edward I. The conflict escalated to a point where civil war threatened, but was resolved when the war effort turned towards Scotland. The king signed the Confirmatio Cartarum\u2014a confirmation of Magna Carta\u2014and Bohun and Bigod agreed to serve on the Falkirk Campaign. Bohun died in 1298, and was succeeded by his son, Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.\n\nFamily background and inheritance\nHumphrey (VI) de Bohun was part of a line of Anglo-Norman aristocrats going back to the Norman Conquest, most of whom carried the same name. His grandfather was Humphrey (IV) de Bohun, who had been part of the baronial opposition of Simon de Montfort, but later gone over to the royal side. He was taken prisoner at the Battle of Lewes in May 1264, but was restored to favour after the royalist victory at the Battle of Evesham the next year. Humphrey (IV)'s son, Humphrey (V) de Bohun, remained loyal to the baronial side throughout the Barons' War, and was captured at Evesham on 4 August 1265. In October of that year, Humphrey (V) died in captivity at Beeston Castle in Cheshire from injuries he had sustained in the battle.Humphrey (V) had been excluded from succession as a result of his rebellion, but when Humphrey (IV) died in 1275, Humphrey (VI) inherited the earldoms of Hereford and Essex. Humphrey (VI) had already served as deputy Constable of England under Humphrey (IV). Humphrey (IV) had reserved the honour of Pleshey for his younger son Henry, but the remainder of his lands went to Humphrey (VI). The inheritance Humphrey (VI) received\u2014in addition to land in Essex and Wiltshire from Humphrey (IV)\u2014also consisted of significant holdings in the Welsh Marches from his mother. His mother Eleanor was a daughter and coheir of William de Braose and his wife Eva Marshal, who in turn was the daughter and co-heir of William Marshal, regent to Henry III.Since Humphrey (VI) was only sixteen years old at the time of his father's death, the Braose lands were taken into the king's custody until 1270. Part of this inheritance, the marcher lordship of Brecon, was in the meanwhile given to the custody of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford. Humphrey technically regained his lordship from Clare in 1270, but by this time these lands had effectively been taken over by the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who had taken advantage of the previous decade's political chaos in England to extend his territory into the Marches.He granted his brother Sir Gilbert de Bohun all of their mother's lands in Ireland and some land in England and Wales.\n\nWelsh Wars\nOver the next years, much of Hereford's focus was on reconquering his lost lands in the Marches, primarily through private warfare against Llywelyn. Henry III died in 1272, while his son\u2014now Edward I\u2014was crusading; Edward did not return until 1274. Llywelyn refused to pay homage to the new king, partly because of the military actions of Bohun and other marcher lords, which Llywelyn saw as violations of the Treaty of Montgomery. On 12 November 1276, Hereford was present at a royal assembly where judgment was passed on Llewelyn, and in 1277, Edward I declared war on the Welsh prince. Rebellion in his own Brecon lands delayed Hereford's participation in the early days of the Welsh war. He managed, however, to both suppress the rebellion and conquer lands further west. He then joined up with the royal army and served for a while in Anglesey, before returning to Brecon, where he received the surrender of certain Welsh lords. After the campaign was over, on 2 January 1278, he received protection from King Edward to go on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.In 1282, war with Wales broke out again; this time it would not be simply a punitive campaign, but a full-scale war of conquest. Initially, the king wanted to fight the war with paid forces, but the nobility insisted on the use of the feudal summons. To men like Hereford, this was preferable, because as part of a feudal army the participants would have both a stake in the war and a justifiable claim on conquered land. In the end, although the earls won, none of them were paid for the war effort. Hereford jealously guarded his authority as hereditary Constable of England, and protested vigorously when the Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester was appointed commander of the forces in South Wales. In the post-war settlement, however, neither Hereford nor Gloucester received any significant rewards of land, the way several other magnates did. Hereford fought again in Wales, in the suppression of the rebellion of 1294\u201395, when he again had to pacify the territory of Brecon before joining the king in the north.\n\nPrivate war in the Marches\nParallel with the Welsh Wars, Hereford was also struggling to assert his claims to lands in the Marches against other marcher lords. In 1284 Edward I granted the hundred of Iscennen in Carmarthenshire to John Giffard. Hereford believed the land belonged to him by right of conquest, and started a campaign to win the lands back, but the king took Giffard's side. Problems also arose with the earl of Gloucester. As Gloucester's former ward, Hereford had to buy back his own right of marriage, but Gloucester claimed he had not received the full sum. There was also remaining resentment on Hereford's part for his subordination to Gloucester in the 1282\u201383 campaign. The conflict came to a head when Gloucester's started construction of a castle at Morlais, which Hereford claimed was his land. In 1286, the Crown ordered Gloucester to cease, but to no avail.It had long been established Marches custom to solve conflicts through private warfare. Hereford's problem, however, was his relative weakness in the Marches, and now he was facing open conflict with two different enemies. He, therefore, decided to take the issue to the king instead, in a break with tradition. King Edward again ordered Gloucester to stop, but the earl ignored the order and initiated raids on Hereford's lands. Hostilities continued and Hereford responded, until both earls were arrested and brought before the king. The real offence was not the private warfare in itself, but the fact that the earls had not respected the king's injunction to cease. In the parliament of January 1292, Gloucester was fined 10,000 marks and Hereford 1,000. Gloucester's liberty of Glamorgan was declared forfeit, and confiscated by the crown, as was Hereford's of Brecon.In the end, the fines were never paid, and the lands were soon restored. Edward had nevertheless demonstrated an important point. After the conquest of Wales, the strategic position of the Marches lordships was less vital to the English crown, and the liberty awarded to the marcher lords could be curtailed. For Edward this was, therefore, a good opportunity to assert the royal prerogative, and to demonstrate that it extended also into the Marches of Wales.\n\nOpposition to Edward I\nIn 1294 the French king declared the English duchy of Aquitaine forfeit, and war broke out between the two countries. Edward I embarked on a wide-scale and costly project of building alliances with other princes on the Continent, and preparing an invasion. When the king, at the parliament of March 1297 in Salisbury, demanded military service from his earls, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, refused in his capacity of marshal of England. The argument was that the king's subjects were not obliged to serve abroad if not in the company of the king, but Edward insisted on taking his army to Flanders while sending his earls to Gascony.\n  \nAt the time of the Salisbury parliament, Hereford was accompanying two of the king's daughters to Brabant, and could not be present. On his return, however, as Constable of England, he joined Bigod in July in refusing to perform feudal service. The two earls were joined in their opposition by the earls of Arundel and Warwick. The main reason for the magnates' defiance was the heavy burden of taxation caused by Edward's continuous warfare in Wales, France and Scotland. In this they were also joined by Robert Winchelsey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was in the midst of an ongoing dispute with the king over clerical taxation. At one point Bohun and Bigod turned up in person at the Exchequer to protest a tax they claimed did not have the consent of the community of the realm. For Hereford there was also a personal element in the opposition to the king, after the humiliation and the affront to his liberties he had suffered over the dispute in the Marches. At a meeting just outside London, Bohun gave an impassioned speech objecting to the king's abuse of power and demanding the restoration of ancient liberties. The grievances were summarised in a document known as the Remonstrances.Neither party showed any inclination to back down, and the nation seemed on the brink of another civil war. Just as the conflict was coming to a head, however, external events intervened to settle it. In September 1297, the English suffered a heavy defeat to the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The Scottish victory exposed the north of England to Scottish raids led by William Wallace. The war with Scotland received wider support from the English magnates, now that their own homeland was threatened, than did the war in France to protect the king's continental possessions. Edward abandoned his campaign in France and negotiated a truce with the French king. He agreed to confirm Magna Carta in the so-called Confirmatio Cartarum (Confirmation of the Charters). The earls consequently consented to serve with the king in Scotland, and Hereford was in the army that won a decisive victory over the Scots in the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. Hereford, not satisfied that the king had upheld the charter, withdrew after the battle, forcing Edward to abandon the campaign.\n\nDeath and family\nIn 1275 Bohun married Maud de Fiennes, daughter of Enguerrand de Fiennes, chevalier, seigneur of Fiennes, by his 2nd wife, Isabel (kinswoman of Queen Eleanor of Provence). She predeceased him, and was buried at Walden Priory in Essex. Hereford himself died at Pleshey Castle on 31 December 1298, and was buried at Walden alongside his wife. They had one son Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford, born around 1276. The son was given possession of his father's lands and titles on 16 February 1299. The young Humphrey also inherited his father's title of Constable of England.A common theme in Humphrey de Bohun's actions was his fierce protection of what he regarded as his feudal privileges. His career was marked by turbulence and political strife, particularly in the Marches of Wales, but eventually he left a legacy of consolidated possessions there. In 1297, at the height of the conflict between Edward I and rebellious barons, the king had actively tried to undermine Hereford's authority in the Marches, but failed due to the good relations the earl enjoyed with the local men.\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nHumphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford\nHumphrey IV de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, 1st Earl of Essex (1204 \u2013 24 September 1275) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and soldier who served as hereditary Constable of England.\n\nOrigins\nHe was the eldest son and heir of Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford (1176\u20131220) by his wife Maud de Mandeville (alias Maud FitzGeoffrey), daughter and heiress of Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex.\n\nCareer\nHe was one of the nine godfathers of Prince Edward, the future King Edward I. He served as Sheriff of Kent for 1239\u201340. In 1258, after returning from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Humphrey fell away, like his father, from the royal cause to that of the barons. He served as a nominee of the opposition on the \"committee of twenty-four\" which was appointed in the Oxford Parliament of that year, to create the Provisions of Oxford to reform the administration. The alliance of Simon de Montfort with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd of North Wales brought Bohun back to royal allegiance. He headed the first secession of the Welsh Marchers from the party of the opposition (1263), and was among the captives whom the Montfortians took at the Battle of Lewes in 1264.He was amongst the victors at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, which extinguished the power of de Montfort, at which, however, his eldest son, Humphrey V de Bohun, was mortally wounded. Humphrey was selected as one of the twelve arbitrators to draw up the Dictum of Kenilworth (1266), by which the disinherited rebels were allowed to make their peace.\n\nMarriages and issue\nHe married twice:\n\nFirstly, in about 1236, to Maud de Lusignan (c. 1210 \u2013 14 August 1241), daughter of Raoul I of Lusignan, Comte d'Eu, second husband of Alix d'Eu, 8th Comtesse d'Eu.

His mother was Margaret of Huntingdon, widow of Conan IV, Duke of Brittany (d.1171) and a daughter of Henry of Scotland, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, son of King David I of Scotland by his wife Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon. Henry's half-sister was Constance, Duchess of Brittany.\n\nEarldom\nHis paternal grandmother was Margaret of Hereford, a daughter of Miles FitzWalter of Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford, Lord of Brecknock (died 1143), Sheriff of Gloucester and Constable of England. After the male line of Miles of Gloucester failed, in 1199 King John created Henry de Bohun Earl of Hereford and Constable of England. His lands lay chiefly on the Welsh Marches, and from this date the Bohuns took a foremost place among the Marcher barons.Henry de Bohun was one of the twenty-five barons elected by their peers to enforce the terms of Magna Carta in 1215. He was subsequently excommunicated by the Pope. In the civil war that followed Magna Carta, he was a supporter of King Louis VIII of France and was captured at the Battle of Lincoln in 1217.\n\nMarriage and issue\nHe married Maud de Mandeville (alias Maud FitzGeoffrey), daughter and heiress of Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex, of Pleshy Castle in Essex, by whom he had issue including:\n\nHumphrey IV de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, 1st Earl of Essex (1204-1275), eldest son and heir, created Earl of Essex in 1239, who married Maud de Lusignan, by whom he had at least three children.\nHenry de Bohun, who died young.\nRalph de Bohun.\n\nDeath\nHe died in June 1220 while on crusade to the Holy Land.",
    "Passage 1:\nBill Dundee\nWilliam Cruickshanks (born 24 October 1943) is a retired Scottish-born Australian professional wrestler and author better known by his stage name Bill Dundee. Cruickshanks is the father of Jamie Dundee and was the father-in-law of wrestler Bobby Eaton.\n\nCareer\nDundee was born in Angus, Scotland, and raised in Melbourne. At 16, he joined the circus as a trapeze artist. He started wrestling in Australia in 1962 and finally arrived in the United States as \"Superstar\" Bill Dundee in 1974 with his tag team partner George Barnes.\nDundee made a name for himself in the Memphis Territory, where he regularly teamed and feuded with Jerry Lawler and Jimmy Valiant for years. Dundee and Lawler ventured to the American Wrestling Association in 1987 and captured the AWA World Tag Team Championship twice.\nAs a singles wrestler, he held the Southern Heavyweight Championship belt several times from 1975 to 1985. Also, he had a successful team with \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Landel that wreaked havoc in Tennessee.\nDundee had a brief run in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions, Central States Wrestling and Florida Championship Wrestling in 1986, where he teamed with Jimmy Garvin and feuded with Sam Houston for the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship. He also briefly managed The Barbarian and The MOD Squad while in those territories.\nHe also had a run in World Championship Wrestling in the early 1990s as Sir William, the manager for Lord Steven Regal.\nDundee worked as a booker for Memphis, Louisiana and Georgia.\nDundee is still active as of 2019 in Memphis Wrestling, where he has been a heel and a baby face. He frequently appears on Jackson, Tennessee, talk radio station WNWS 101.5 with Dan Reeves and on a talk show on Public-access television cable TV channels in West Tennessee. He still promotes indy cards across Tennessee and in Southaven, Mississippi. He currently runs a podcast on Anchor named If You Don't Want the Answer, Don't Ask the Question.\nOn 20 July 2019, Dundee, at 75 years old, defeated Tony Deppen to win the unofficial WOMBAT Television Championship for Game Changer Wrestling in Tullahoma, Tennessee.\n\nBooks\nIf You Don't Want The Answer, Don't Ask The Question: Bill Dundee's Life Story\n\nPersonal life\nDundee's son Jamie Dundee, also became a wrestler, whereas his daughter Donna, married wrestler Bobby Eaton. His grandson, Dylan Eaton, wrestles as well.\nIn the early 1990s he partnered with Doug Hurt, brother of Jerry Lawler's manager, in the opening of a furniture store in Evansville, Indiana called \"Superstar Dundee Furniture\". The store collapsed about a year after opening.\nOn 26 June 2021, his daughter Donna died at the age of 57 from breast cancer. Just over a month later, his son-in-law Bobby Eaton died on 4 August 2021 at the age of 62, just two weeks after suffering a fall at his home.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nAmerican Wrestling Federation\nAWF Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nCentral States Wrestling\nNWA Central States Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nMemphis Wrestling Hall of Fame\nClass of 2017\nMid-South Wrestling Association\nMid-South Television Championship (1 time)\nNWA Mid-America / Continental Wrestling Association / Championship Wrestling Association\nAWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (9 times)\nAWA Southern Tag Team Championship (14 times) \u2013 with Norvell Austin (1), Robert Gibson (1), Jerry Lawler (4), Robert Fuller (1), Tommy Rich (2), Dream Machine (2), Steve Keirn (2) and Dutch Mantel (1)\nAWA World Tag Team Championship (2 times) \u2013 with Jerry Lawler1\nCWA International Heavyweight Championship (4 times)\nCWA International Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Rocky Johnson\nCWA Southwestern Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nCWA World Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nCWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Tommy Rich\nNWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nNWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Ricky Gibson\nNWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (Memphis version) (1 time)\nNWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Mid-America version) (3 times) \u2013 with Big Bad John (2) and Tommy Rich (1)\nNWA United States Junior Heavyweight Championship (2 times)\nOhio Valley Wrestling\nOVW Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nPower Pro Wrestling\nPPW Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Jerry Lawler\nPro Wrestling Illustrated\nRanked No. 56 of the 100 top tag teams of the \"PWI Years\" with Jerry Lawler in 2003\nPro Wrestling This Week\nWrestler of the Week (21\u201327 June 1987)\nSoutheastern Championship Wrestling\nNWA Southeastern Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Tommy Rich\nNWA United States Junior Heavyweight Championship (Southeastern version) (1 time)\nSupreme Wrestling\nSupreme Mid-America Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Rob Royale\nUnited States Wrestling Association\nUSWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nUSWA Junior Heavyweight Championship (2 times)\nUSWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (3 times)\nUSWA Texas Heavyweight Championship (3 times)\nUSWA World Tag Team Championship (3 times) \u2013 with Jerry Lawler (2) and Jamie Dundee (1)\nWOMBAT Wrestling\nWOMBAT Television Championship (1 time, current)\nWorld Class Wrestling Association\nCWA Southwestern Heavyweight Championship (2 times)21Dundee's and Lawler's reigns with the AWA World Tag Team Championship began on cards hosted by the CWA through the interpromotional relationship between the AWA and CWA that also allowed the defense of the AWA Southern Heavyweight and Southern Tag Team Championships primarily within the CWA.2The CWA Southwestern Heavyweight Championship was promoted in both the CWA and WCWA while the promotions had a working relationship in 1989 and 1990.\nPassage 2:\nMohammad Ilyas (cricketer)\nMohammad Ilyas Mahmood  (Urdu: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f ; born 19 March 1946) is a former Pakistani cricketer who played in ten Test matches between 1964 and 1969.\n\nCricket career\nIlyas was an opening batsman and occasional leg-spin bowler. He played first-class cricket in Pakistan from 1961 to 1972. He scored 126 in the Third Test against New Zealand in Karachi in April 1965, when Pakistan needed 202 to win in five and half hours, and reached the target with a session to spare for the loss of only two wickets. He made his highest first-class score in December 1964, when he scored 154 against South Australia.He toured Australia a second time with the Pakistan team in 1972\u201373, but was injured early in the tour and omitted from the team before it left for the New Zealand leg of the tour. At the time he decided to stay in Australia to live, but he later returned to Pakistan. He served for a time as a national selector, but was dismissed in 2011 for allegedly violating the Pakistan Cricket Board's code of conduct.\n\nFamily\nHe is the father-in-law of Imran Farhat and Kamran Akmal. Nazar Mohammad was his uncle.\nPassage 3:\nRosamund (wife of Alboin)\nRosamund (fl. 572) was a Lombard queen. She was the daughter of Cunimund, king of the Gepids, and wife of Alboin, king of the Lombards.\n\nLife\nRosamund was born into a kingdom in crisis, as the Gepid people had been fighting a losing battle against the Lombards since 546, firstly within the context of a Lombardic-East Roman alliance, and later against the Lombards and the Avar nomads. These wars had taken the lives of not only her grandfather king Thurisind, but also her uncle, Thurismund, both of which served to establish a long-standing hatred of the Lombards in her father, Cunimund, which he passed down to her.\nThis hatred was what spawned the final war of the Gepids, as Cunimund attempted to win back lost lands against the Lombards. The war, however, quickly turned, and in 567, the Gepid Kingdom would be completely subdued by a mixture of Lombard and Avar forces, her father was decapitated and she, along with many other Gepids, was taken as a prisoner of the Lombards (see Lombard\u2013Gepid War (567)). However, in an attempt to secure a male heir and following the death of his first wife Clotsuinda of Frankia, Alboin took her as his wife. Alboin was noted for his cruelty towards her; his most famous act of cruelty was reported by Paulus Diaconus, who states that at a royal banquet in Verona, Alboin forced her to drink from the skull of her dead father (which he carried around his belt), inviting her \"to drink merrily with her father\".\nAfter this, she began plotting to have her husband assassinated.  Thus, Rosamund met with the king's arms bearer and her lover, Helmichis, who suggested using Peredeo, \"a very strong man\", to accomplish the assassination. Peredeo refused to help, and that night mistakenly had intercourse with Rosamund, who was disguised as a servant. After learning that he had committed adultery with his king's wife, Peredeo agreed to take part in an assassination attempt in fear of the king's retribution. After the great feast, Alboin went to bed inebriated, at which point Rosamund ordered the king's sword bound to his bedpost, so that should he wake in the middle of the assassination attempt, he would be defenseless. Alboin did wake, only to find himself unarmed. He fended off his attackers temporarily with a footstool, but was killed. Due in part to the work of Paulus Diaconus, there seems to be some confusion about who actually killed Alboin, with both Helmichis and Peredeo assigned as sole murderer.Immediately afterwards, Helmichis planned to marry Rosamund and usurp the throne by claiming kingship. However, this plan gained little support from the various duchies of the Lombard kingdom, so Rosamund, Helmichis, and Albsuinda, Alboin's daughter by his first wife, fled together to the East Roman stronghold of Ravenna with a large proportion of Alboin's private treasures.  Rosamund and Helmichis married in Ravenna, but were soon divided when Rosamund, in an attempt to curry favour, took as a lover Longinus, the exarch, who had helped them plan the murder of Alboin. At the urging of Longinus, who promised to marry her, she attempted to murder her former lover Helmichis by poisoning, handing him the drink after he had washed; however, she was instead murdered by Helmichis, who forced her to drink the poison before committing suicide by the same means.\n\nRosamund in later culture\nRosamund would inspire many later tragedies, based on her life, particularly in Italy, where the folk song \"Donna Lumbarda\" was passed down orally through the generations, inspiring later renditions of the tale.\nShe's a heroine of Boccaccio's De casibus virorum illustrium (book 8).\nMedieval folk tales and legends developed. The first true tragedy, Giovanni Rucellai's Rosmunda, was first performed in 1525 and would serve as the basis for many later tellings of the story in the Italian language, such as Vittorio Alfieri's 1783 work of the same name and a Sam Benelli play of 1911. The conspiracy to murder Alboin also inspired the 1961/2 film Rosmunda e Alboino, aka Sword of the Conqueror etc., by Carlo Campogalliani.\nIn 1665 Urban Hj\u00e4rne wrote a comedy in Swedish on the same matter, Rosimunda. It is the first original play in that language known to have actually been staged, as entertainment for the young Charles XI while he studied at Uppsala university.\nIn the English language, the story would also be considered a tragedy, albeit more often neglected than in the Italian tradition, but it was the subject of Robert Burton Rodney's mid 19th C. poem Alboin and Rosamond, and would be treated by the pre-Raphaelite poet Algernon Charles Swinburne in his 1899 work Rosamund, Queen of the Lombards.\nIn Meg Cabot's young adult novel series The Princess Diaries published from 2000 on, Rosimunda is renamed 'Rosagunde'. While the story of her marriage to Alboin is the same, in Cabot's re-telling she is granted Genovia by the king of Italy as a reward for killing Alboin, making her the first princess of Genovia and an ancestor to the series' protagonist Mia Thermopolis.\n\nSee also\nCleopatra VII\nTheodora\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n Media related to Rosamund at Wikimedia Commons\nPassage 4:\nLudwig von Westphalen\nJohann Ludwig von Westphalen (11 July 1770 \u2013 3 March 1842) was a liberal Prussian civil servant and the father-in-law of Karl Marx.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nJohann Ludwig von Westphalen was born on 11 July 1770 in Bornum am Elm. He was the youngest son of Philipp von Westphalen (1724\u201392), who himself was the son of a Blankenburg postmaster. Philipp von Westphalen had been ennobled in 1764 with the predicate Edler von Westphalen by Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick for his military services. He had served as the duke's de facto \"chief of staff\" during the Seven Years' War. Through his mother, Jane Wishart of Pittarrow, he was the descendant of many Scottish and European noble families.He received extensive education and spoke German and English, and read Latin, Greek, Italian, French and Spanish. He studied at the Collegium Carolinum, the forerunner of today's Braunschweig University of Technology, and at G\u00f6ttingen.\n\nCareer\nIn 1794, he entered government's service in Brunswick. In 1797 he married Elisabeth von Veltheim, who bore him four children. In 1804 he entered the government service of the Duchy of Brunswick and Lunenburg (Wolfenb\u00fcttel).\nWith the establishment of the Napoleonic state in Westphalia (the Kingdom of Westphalia) in 1807, he entered its service. He was likely motivated in this by a desire to see reforms carried out. He did, however, oppose the French dominance of the local government, and other policies, and for his critique he was eventually arrested by orders from Louis-Nicolas Davout and imprisoned in the fortress of Gifhorn. In the same year, he lost his first wife. In the summer of 1809 Louis was appointed sub-prefect of Salzwedel, where three years later in 1812 he married Karoline Heubel; they had three children. After Salzwedel was again under Prussian administration, in 1816 Ludwig von Westphalen was transferred to the newly established regional government in Trier.\n\nPersonal life\nIt was in Trier that he met and befriended Heinrich Marx, the father of Karl Marx. The children of the respective families, in particular Jenny and Edgar von Westphalen, and Sophie and Karl Marx, became close friends as well. In 1836, Jenny von Westphalen and Karl Marx became engaged; at first secretly but Ludwig approved the marriage in 1837, even though some saw Marx, who was both middle class and younger than her, as well as of Jewish descent, as an inappropriate partner for the noble daughter. In fact, Ludwig was seen as the mentor and role model of Karl Marx, who referred to him as a \"dear fatherly friend\". Ludwig filled Marx with enthusiasm for the romantic school and read him Homer and Shakespeare, who remained Marx's favorite authors all his life. Marx also read Voltaire and Racine with Ludwig. Ludwig devoted much of his time to the young Marx and the two went for intellectual walks through \"the hills and woods\" of the neighbourhood. It was Ludwig who first introduced Marx to the personality and socialist teachings of Saint-Simon. Marx dedicated his doctoral thesis \"The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature\" written in 1841 to Ludwig in a most effusive manner in which Marx wrote \"You, my fatherly friend, have always been for me the living proof that idealism is no illusion, but the true reality\" In 1842, Marx was present at the deathbed of Ludwig von Westphalen. Jenny and Karl became married in 1843, a year after Ludwig's death.\nHe was the father of Ferdinand von Westphalen, a conservative and reactionary Prussian Minister of the Interior.\n\nDeath\nHe died on 3 March 1842 in Trier.\nPassage 5:\nJames Armour (Master mason)\nJames Armour (15 January 1731 \u2013 20 September 1798) was a master mason and father of Jean Armour, and therefore the father-in-law of the poet Robert Burns. His birth year was shown here as 1730. The Scotland's People database has no record of this year of birth for a James Armour. Wikitree and several other data sources have his birth date as 10th/24th January 1731. The Scotland's People database has this record but showing his baptism on 24 January 1731. His birth on the original Old Parish Record is shown as 15 January 1731 to John Armour and Margrat(sic) Picken in Kilmarnock. James named his first son John which would normally be after James's father i.e. John. The chances of there being two James's born on exactly the same date exactly one year apart appear very remote and the naming of the first child seems to validate the conclusion that James Armour was born in 1731 and not 1730.\n\nLife and background\nAt Mauchline on 7 December 1761 he married Mary Smith, the daughter of stonemason Adam Smith. James died on 30 September 1798 and was buried in the family lair in Mauchline churchyard. His wife died in 1805 and was buried with her husband.\n\nFamily\nJames' eleven offspring with Mary, were, in birth order, John, Jean, James, Robert, Adam, Helen, Mary, Robert (2nd), Mary (2nd), Janet and Robert (3rd). Three siblings died in childhood. Dr John Armour was the eldest son who was born in Mauchline on 14 November 1762 and died in 1834. He had his practice in Kincardine-on-Forth where he died and was buried. He had two children, Janet and John, and married Janet Coventry on 10 March 1787. James and Mary's son James was born in Mauchline on 26 April 1767, married Betthaia Walker in 1794, Martha in 1818 and Janet in 1822. Their offspring were James and Betthaia. Adam Armour was named after Adam Smith, James Armour's father-in-law.The Armours' single-storey house stood in Cowgate, separated from John Dove's Whitefoord Arms by a narrow lane. Jean's bedroom window looked on to a window of the inn, thereby allowing Burns to converse with her from the public house itself. The Whitefoord Inn was often frequented by Burns and was also the meeting place of the so-called Court of Equity and linked to a significant incident in the life of Jean's brother Adam regarding the mistreatment of Agnes Wilson.\n\nOccupation and social standing\nJames was a master mason and contractor rather than an architect, regardless of Burns' attempts to describe him as one. He is known to have carried out contract work at Dumfries House near Cumnock and tradition links him to the building of Howford Bridge on the River Ayr, Greenan Bridge on the River Doon; Skeldon House, Dalrymple; and several other bridges in Ayrshire. Both the Armours and his wife's family had been stone-masons for several generations. William Burnes, Robert Burns' cousin, was apprenticed to James Armour.James was an adherent of the 'Auld Licht' style of religion and rented at 10/8 per year one of the most expensive pews in Mauchline church. James was rigid and austere, apparently living an exemplary life. Robert Burns-Begg, Burns' great-nephew, states that in contrast to her husband, Mary Armour was \"Partaken somewhat of the gay and frivolous.\".William 'Willie' Patrick, a source of many anecdotes about Robert and his family, stated about James that \"he was only a bit mason body, wha used to snuff a guid deal and gae afen tak a bit dram!\" He went on to say regarding James' attitude to Robert Burns that \"The thing was, he hated him, and would raither hae seen the Deil himsel comin to the hoose to coort his dochter than him! He cu'dna bear the sicht o'm, and that was the way he did it!\".\n\nAssociation with Robert Burns\nJames had disapproved of Burns's courtship of Jean, being aware of his affair with Elizabeth Paton, his 'New Licht' leanings and his poor financial situation. When informed in March 1786 by his distraught wife that Jean was pregnant he fainted and upon recovering consciousness and being given a strong cordial drink he enquired who the father was, fainting again when he was told that it was Robert Burns. The couple persuaded Jean to travel to Paisley and lodge with their relative Andrew Purdie, husband of her aunt Elizabeth Smith. Robert Wilson lived in Paisley, a possible suitor who had shown a romantic interest in Jean previously, appears to have been only part of the reason for this action, for on 8 April Mary Armour had vehemently denied to James Lamie, a member of the Kirk Session, that Jean was pregnant.\nRobert Burns produced a paper, probably a record of their \"Marriage by Declaration\" possibly witnessed by James Smith. This document, no longer extant, was defaced under James Armour's direction, probably by the lawyer Robert Aitken, with the names of both Robert and Jean being cut out. This act did not in fact effect its legality.  Robert wrote that James Armour's actions had \"...cut my very veins\", a feeling enhanced by Jean having handed over \"the unlucky paper\" and had agreed to go to Paisley.\nJames Armour in the meantime forced his daughter to sign a complaint and a warrant \"in meditatione fugae\" against Robert was issued to prevent his abandoning her. Burns fled to Old Rome Forest near Gatehead in South Ayrshire, where Jean Brown, Agnes Broun's half-sister and therefore an aunt of Burns, lived with her husband, James Allan.\nTwins were born to Jean and Robert on 3 September 1786, named after their parents as was the kirk's protocol for children born out of wedlock. Robert, notified of the birth by Adam Armour, that Sunday went to the Armour's house with a gift of tea, sugar and a Guinea that proved most acceptable.  Robert only returned from Edinburgh in the summer of 1787 to find that he was, thanks to his newly found fame as a published poet, actively welcomed into the family.\nJean however fell pregnant out of official wedlock once more, with the result that she felt forced to leave the Armour's home due to her father's anger. She was taken in by Willie Muir and his wife at Tarbolton Mill. It had previously been agreed that baby Jean would stay with her mother and baby Robert would join Bess at Mossgiel. The second set of twins did not live long and are buried, unnamed, in the Armour lair in Mauchline churchyard. Robert was in Edinburgh and did not arrive back until 23 February 1788; he then arranged accommodation for Jean.Whilst at the Brow Well Robert Burns wrote two of his last letters to his father-in-law asking that Mary Armour, who was away visiting relatives in Fife, be sent to Dumfries to help care for Jean who was heavily pregnant. On 10 July 1796 his last letter was signed \"Your most affectionate son. R. Burns.\"Upon the death of Robert Burnes his nephew Robert arranged for his cousin William to become a mason or building worker, working with James Armour, Burns' father-in-law.\n\nThe Inveraray marble Punch Bowl\nOf the many surviving Robert Burns artefacts few have such distinguished provenance as the punch bowl that was a nuptial gift in 1788 from James Armour to his daughter Jean and her new husband Robert Burns. As a stone-mason James had carved it himself (22cm x 14cm ) from dark green Inveraray marble and after residing at their various homes, Jean in 1801 presented it to her husband's great friend and Burns family benefactor Alexander Cunningham whilst she was on a visit to Edinburgh and staying with George Thomson. He had it mounted with a silver base and a rim, engraved upon which are the words \u201cYe whom social pleasure charms .. Come to my Bowl! Come to my arms, My FRIENDS, my BROTHERS!\u201d taken from Burns\u2019s \u201cThe Epistle to J. Lapraik.\u201dAlexander died in 1812 and it was then sold at auction in 1815 for the impressive price of 80 Guineas to a London publican who, falling upon hard times,  sold it to Archibald Hastie Esq of London. A copy is held by the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum at Alloway, whilst the original is in the British Museum in London, presented to that institution by Archibald Hastie in 1858.\n\nSee also\nAdam Armour\nJean Armour\nRobert Burnes\nWilliam Burnes\nPassage 6:\nPeter Burroughs\nPeter Burroughs (born 27 January 1947) is a British television and film actor and the director of Willow Management. He is the father-in-law of actor and TV presenter Warwick Davis.\n\nEarly career\nBurroughs initially ran a shop in his village at Yaxley, Cambridgeshire.\nHis first dramatic role was that of the character \"Branic\" in the 1979 television series The Legend of King Arthur. He also acted in the television shows Dick Turpin, The Goodies, Doctor Who in the serial The King's Demons and One Foot in the Grave.\n\nFilm career\nBurroughs played roles in Hollywood movies such as Flash Gordon, George Lucas' Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi (a swinging ewok), Willow, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. In 1995, Burroughs set up Willow Management, an agency for short actors, along with co-actor Warwick Davis. He portrayed a bank goblin in the Harry Potter series (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2).\n\nPersonal life\nHis daughter Samantha (born 1971), is married to Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi and Willow film star Warwick Davis. He has another daughter, Hayley Burroughs, who is also an actress. His granddaughter is Annabelle Davis.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 7:\nHelmichis\nHelmichis (fl. 572) was a Lombard noble who killed his king, Alboin, in 572 and unsuccessfully attempted to usurp his throne. Alboin's queen, Rosamund, supported or at least did not oppose Helmichis' plan to remove the king, and after the assassination Helmichis married her. The assassination was assisted by Peredeo, the king's chamber-guard, who in some sources becomes the material executer of the murder. Helmichis is first mentioned by the contemporary chronicler Marius of Avenches, but the most detailed account of his endeavours derives from Paul the Deacon's  late 8th-century Historia Langobardorum.\nThe background to the assassination begins when Alboin killed the king of the Gepids in 567 and captured the king's daughter Rosamund. Alboin then led his people into Italy, and by 572 had settled himself in Verona, which made him vulnerable to the ambitions of other prominent Lombards, such as Helmichis, who was Alboin's foster-brother and arms-bearer.  After Alboin's death, Helmichis attempted to gain the throne. He married Rosamund to legitimize his position as new king, but immediately faced stiff opposition from his fellow Lombards who suspected Helmichis of conniving with the Byzantines; this hostility eventually focused around the duke of Ticinum Cleph, supporter of an aggressive policy towards the Empire.\nRather than going to war, Helmichis, Rosamund and their followers escaped to Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine Italy, where they were received with full honours by the authorities. Once in Ravenna, Rosamund was persuaded by the Byzantine prefect Longinus to kill Helmichis in order to be free to marry him. Rosamund proceeded to poison Helmichis, but the latter, having understood what his wife had done to him, forced her to drink the cup too, so both of them died. After their deaths, Longinus dispatched Helmichis' forces to Constantinople, while the remaining Lombards had already found a new king in Cleph.\n\nBackground\nThe oldest author to write about Helmichis is the contemporary chronicler Marius of Avenches. In his account he mentions that \"Alboin was killed by his followers, that is Hilmaegis with the rest, his wife agreeing to it\". Marius continues by adding that, after killing the king, Helmichis married his widow and tried unsuccessfully to gain the throne. His attempt failed and he was forced to escape together with his wife, the royal treasure and the troops that had sided with him in the coup. This account has strong similarities with what is told in the Origo. The Origo would in its turn become a direct source for the Historia Langobardorum.The background to the assassination begins when Alboin, king of the Lombards, a Germanic people living in Pannonia (in the region of modern Hungary), went to war against the neighbouring Gepids in 567. In a decisive battle, Alboin killed the Gepid king Cunimund and captured the king's daughter Rosamund \u2013 later marrying her to guarantee the loyalty of the surviving Gepids. The following year, the Lombards migrated to Italy, a territory then held by the Byzantine Empire. In 569 Alboin took Mediolanum (Milan), the capital of northern Italy, and by 570 he had assumed control of most of northern Italy. The Byzantine forces entrenched themselves in the strategic town of Ticinum (Pavia), which they took only after a long siege. Even before taking Ticinum, the Lombards crossed the Apennines and invaded Tuscia. After the fall of Ticinum, Alboin chose Verona as his first permanent headquarters. In this town Alboin was assassinated in 572 and it is in these circumstances that Helmichis' name is first heard of. Most of the available details are in the Historia Langobardorum.\n\nAssassination\nBy settling himself in Verona and temporarily interrupting his chain of conquests, Alboin had weakened his popular standing as a charismatic warrior king. The first to take advantage of this was Rosamund, who could count on the support of the Gepid warriors in the town in her search for an opportunity to avenge the death of her father. To obtain this goal she persuaded Helmichis, spatharius (arms bearer) and foster brother of the king, and also head of a personal armed retinue in Verona, to take part in a plot to eliminate Alboin and replace him on the throne. Helmichis persuaded Rosamund to involve Peredeo, described by Paul simply as \"a very strong man\", who was seduced through a trick by the Queen and forced to consent to become the actual assassin.This story is partly in conflict with what is told by the Origo, which has Peredeo acting as an instigator and not as the murderer. In a similar vein to the Origo is the account of Peredeo contained in the Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani, where it is added that Peredeo was Alboin's \"chamber-guard\", hinting that in the original version of the story Peredeo's role may just have been to let in the real assassin, who is Helmichis in Agnellus' account, as it had been in that of Marius. However, the primary intent of the Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani may have been to obtain a more straightforward and coherent narrative by reducing the number of actors in the story, beginning with Peredeo. The disappearance of Peredeo, however, means that the role of Helmichis changes: while Paul presents him as \"the efficient conspirator and killer\", with Agnellus he is a victim of a ruthless and domineering queen.According to historian Paolo Delogu it may be that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard oral tradition than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a late distortion of the Germanic myths and rituals contained in the oral tradition. In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.After the king's death on June 28, 572, Helmichis married Rosamund and claimed the Lombard throne in Verona. The marriage was important for Helmichis: it legitimized his rule because, judging from Lombard history, royal prerogatives could be inherited by marrying the king's widow; and the marriage was a guarantee for Helmichis of the loyalty of the Gepids in the army, who sided with the queen since she was Cunimund's daughter.\n\nFailure\nBehind the coup were almost certainly the Byzantines, who had every interest in removing a dangerous enemy and replacing him with somebody, if not from a pro-Byzantine faction, at least less actively aggressive. Gian Piero Bognetti advances a few hypotheses about Helmichis' motivation for his coup: his reason could have involved a family link to the Lethings, the Lombard royal dynasty that had been dispossessed by Alboin's father Audoin; or he may have been related through Amalafrid to the Amali, the leading dynasty of the Goths. Helmichis easily obtained the support of the Lombards in Verona, and he probably hoped to sway all the warriors and Lombard dukes to his side by having Alboin's only child, Albsuinda, under his control. He may also have hoped for Byzantine help in buying the dukes' loyalty economically.Helmichis' coup ultimately failed because it met strong opposition from the many Lombards who wanted to continue the war against the Byzantines and to confront the regicides. Faced with the prospect of going to war at overwhelming odds, Helmichis asked for help from the Byzantines. The praetorian prefect Longinus enabled him to avoid a land route possibly held by hostile forces, by shipping him instead down the Po to Byzantine-held Ravenna, together with his wife, his Lombard and Gepid troops, the royal treasure and Albsuinda. Bognetti believes that Longinus may have planned to make the Lombards weaker by depriving them of any legitimate heir. In addition, because of the ongoing war, it was hard to assemble all the warriors to elect a new king formally. This plan was brought to nothing by the troops stationed in Ticinum, who elected their duke Cleph king, having it in mind to continue Alboin's aggressive policy. In contrast, Wolfram argues that Cleph was elected in Ticinum while Helmichis was still making his bid for the crown in Verona.\n\nDeath\nOnce in Ravenna, Helmichis and Rosamund rapidly became estranged. According to Paul, Longinus persuaded Rosamund to get rid of her husband so that he could marry her. To accomplish this, she made him drink a cup full of poison; before dying, however, Helmichis understood what his wife had done and forced her to drink the cup too, so they both died. According to Wolfram, there may be some historical truth in the account of Longinus' proposal to Rosamund, as it was possible to achieve Lombard kingship by marrying the queen, but the story of the two lovers' end is not historical but legendary. The mutual murder as told by Agnellus is given a different interpretation by Joaquin Martinez Pizarro: he sees Helmichis' last action as a symbol of how the natural hierarchy of sexes is at last restored, after the queen's actions had unnaturally modified the proper equilibrium.At this point, Longinus sent the royal treasure and Albsuinda to Constantinople, the Empire's capital, together with Helmichis' forces, which were to become Byzantine mercenaries. This was a common Byzantine strategy, already applied previously to the Ostrogoths, by which large national contingents were relocated to be used in other theatres. These are believed to be the same 60,000 Lombards that are attested by John of Ephesus as being active in Syria in 575 against the Persians. As for Albsuinda, the Byzantine diplomacy probably aimed to use her as a political tool to impose a pro-Byzantine king on the Lombards. According to Agnellus, once Longinus' actions came to the attention of emperor Justin II they were greatly praised, and the emperor gave lavish gifts to his official.Cleph kept his throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a slave. An important success for the Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed him, opening a decade of interregnum and making the Lombards who remained in Italy more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. It was only when faced with the danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the Lombard dukes elected a new king in the person of Authari, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom.\n\nEarly Middle Ages sources\nAmong the surviving Early Middle Ages sources, there are six that mention Helmichis by name. Of these, the only contemporary one is the Chronica of Marius of Avenches, written in the 580s. Marius was bishop of Aventicum, a town located in the western Alps in the Frankish Kingdom of Burgundy. Because of the small distance from Aventicum to the Italian peninsula, the chronicler had easy access to information regarding northern Italy. For this reason, historian Roger Collins considers the Chronica, though short, to be reliable on Italian matters. The remaining sources all come from Italy and were written in later centuries. Two of them were written in the 7th century, the Continuatio Havniensis Prosperi and the Origo Gentis Langobardorum, both anonymous. The Continuatio is a chronicle written around 625 that has reached us in a single manuscript. As its name suggests, it is a continuation of the 5th century chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine. Derived in considerable measure from the Chronica Majora of Isidore of Seville, it blames the Romans for their inability to defend Italy from foreign invaders, and praises the Lombards for defending the country from the Franks. This is the earliest surviving work to name Rosamund, the queen of the Lombards who plays a central role in Helmichis' attested biography. The other 7th century work, the Origo, is a brief prose history of the Lombards that is essentially an annotated king list, although it begins with a description of the founding myth of the Lombard nation. Giorgio Ausenda believes that the Origo was written around 643 as a prologue to the Edictum Rothari, and continued to be updated till 671. According to Walter Pohl, the author's motives are mostly political: the Origo serves to consolidate the Lombards' national identity by emphasising a shared history. Apart from the origin myth, the only more detailed account is the one concerning the death of Alboin, and thus Helmichis.For the events surrounding 572, the most exhaustive source available is Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum, a history of the Lombard nation up to 744. The book was finished in the last two decades of the 8th century, after the Lombard Kingdom had been conquered by the Franks in 774. Because of the apparent presence in the work of many fragments preserved from Lombard oral tradition, Paul's work has been often interpreted as a tribute to a vanishing culture. Among these otherwise lost traditions stands the tale of Alboin's death. According to Herwig Wolfram, what Paul deals with is an example of how nationally vital events were personalized to make them easier to preserve in the collective memory. Even later than the Historia Langobardorum, but possibly using earlier lost sources, are the last two primary sources to speak about Helmichis: the anonymous Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani and the Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis written by Andreas Agnellus. The first is a brief Christianizing version of the Origo that was made in the first decade of the 9th century from a Carolingian point of view. The second was written in the 830s by a priest from Ravenna and is a history of the bishops who held the see of Ravenna through the ages. Agnellus' passage on Alboin and Rosamund is mostly derived from Paul and little else.\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nJohn Adams (merchant)\nJohn Adams (1672 or 1673 \u2013 c. 1745) was an American-born Canadian merchant and member of the Nova Scotia Council. He was the father-in-law of Henry Newton.\n\nBiography\nAdams was born in Boston in either 1672 or 1673 to John and Avis Adams. Growing up as a petty merchant, Adams joined Sir Charles Hobby's New England regiment, participating in the capture of Port-Royal in 1710. Shortly thereafter, Adams settled in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, returning to civilian life. There, he traded manufactured goods with the province's Acadian and Native Americans, and took up the role of a real estate agent and contractor. Adams joined the Executive Council of Nova Scotia on 28 April 1720, holding his position there for 20 years; the records show that few served as long as he did. He also held several other public positions in the province. Adams was appointed a notary public and deputy collector of customs for Annapolis Royal in 1725, and he was commissioned a justice of the peace in March 1727.Around the mid-1720s, Adams' poor eyesight began to fail, leading to his near-blindness in 1730. After this, he was less active in community activities and trade. Adams petitioned to the king for a pension several times, but failed. He blamed his disability on over-exposure to the sun during an Indian attack on Annapolis Royal in 1724. In December 1739, Lieutenant Governor Lawrence Armstrong died. With the absence of Major Mascarene to take Armstrong's place, Adams became the new president of the council and head of the civil government. (Alexander Cosby was also vying for the position.) In a meeting on 22 March 1740, with the return of Mascarene, the councilors declared that he was the council's rightful president. This turn of events led Adams to retire to Boston in late August or early September 1740, where he stayed for the rest of his life. He died some time after 1745.\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nOgawa Mataji\nViscount Ogawa Mataji (\u5c0f\u5ddd\u53c8\u6b21, 22 August 1848 \u2013 20 October 1909) was a general in the early Imperial Japanese Army. He was also the father-in-law of Field Marshal Gen Sugiyama.\n\nLife and military career\nOgawa was born to a samurai family; his father was a retainer to the daimy\u014d of Kokura Domain, in what is now Kitakyushu, Fukuoka. He studied rangaku under Egawa Hidetatsu and fought as a Kokura samurai against the forces of Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain during the Bakumatsu period.\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, Ogawa attended the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 1871 and promoted to lieutenant in February 1874. He participated in the Taiwan Expedition of April 1874. Afterwards, he served with the IJA 1st Infantry Regiment under the Tokyo Garrison, and as a battalion commander with the IJA 13th Infantry Regiment from April 1876. From February 1877, he fought in the Satsuma Rebellion, but was wounded in combat in April and promoted to major the same month.\nIn March 1878, Ogawa was Deputy Chief-of-Staff to the Kumamoto Garrison. He was sent as a military attach\u00e9 to Beijing from April to July 1880. In February 1881, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and chief of staff of the Osaka Garrison. In March 1882, he was chief of staff of the Hiroshima Garrison. Promoted to colonel in October 1884, he was assigned the IJA 8th Infantry Regiment. In May 1885, he joined the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office. German General Jakob Meckel, hired by the Japanese government as a foreign advisor and instructor in the Imperial Japanese Army Academy highly praised Ogawa and fellow colonel Kodama Gentar\u014d as the two most outstanding officers in the Imperial Japanese Army. Ogawa was especially noted for his abilities as a military strategist and planner, and earned the sobriquet \u201cthe modern Kenshin\") from General Kawakami Soroku.\n\nFirst Sino-Japanese War\nOgawa was promoted to major general in June 1890, and given command of the IJA 4th Infantry Brigade, followed by command of the 1st Guards Brigade. At the start of the First Sino-Japanese War in August 1894, he was chief of staff of the Japanese First Army. In August 1895, he was elevated to the kazoku peerage with the title of danshaku (baron). He commanded the 2nd Guards Brigade from January 1896 and was subsequently promoted to lieutenant general in April 1897, assuming command of the IJA 4th Infantry Division. In May 1903, he was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasures, first class.\n\nRusso-Japanese War\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, Ogawa retained command of the IJA 4th Division under the Japanese Second Army of General Oku Yasukata.  The division was in combat at the Battle of Nanshan, Battle of Telissu and Battle of Liaoyang. At the Battle of Liaoyang, Ogawa was injured in combat, and forced to relinquish his command and return to Tokyo. In January 1905, he was promoted to general, but took a medical leave from December 1905. He was awarded the Order of the Golden Kite, 2nd class in 1906.  In September 1907 he was elevated to viscount (shishaku) He officially retired in November.\nOgawa died on 20 October 1909 due to peritonitis after being hospitalized for dysentery.

    "Passage 1:\nDonnie Elbert\nDonnie Elbert (May 25, 1936 \u2013 January 26, 1989) was an American soul singer and songwriter, who had a prolific career from the mid-1950s to the late 1970s. His U.S. hits included \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" (1971), and his reputation as a Northern soul artist in the UK was secured by \"A Little Piece of Leather\", a performance highlighting his powerful falsetto voice.\n\nCareer\nElbert was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, but when aged three his family relocated to Buffalo, New York. He learned to play guitar and piano as a child, and in 1955 formed a doo-wop group, the Vibraharps, with friend Danny Cannon. Elbert acted as the group's guitarist, songwriter, arranger, and background vocalist, making his recording debut on their single \"Walk Beside Me\". He left the group in 1957 for a solo career, and recorded a demonstration record that earned him a recording contract with the King label's DeLuxe subsidiary. His solo debut \"What Can I Do?\" reached #12 in the U.S. R&B chart, and he followed it up with the less successful \"Believe It or Not\" and \"Have I Sinned?\", which became a regional hit in Pittsburgh.He continued to release singles on DeLuxe, but with little commercial success, and also played New York's Apollo Theater and toured the Chitlin' Circuit of African-American owned nightclubs. After completing an album, The Sensational Donnie Elbert Sings, he left DeLuxe in 1959, joining first Red Top Records, where in 1960 he recorded \"Someday (You'll Want Me to Want You)\", and then Vee-Jay Records, where he had another regional hit with \"Will You Ever Be Mine?\", which reportedly sold 250,000 copies in the Philadelphia area but failed to take off nationwide. His career was also interrupted by a spell in the US Army, from which he was discharged in 1961. He then recorded singles for several labels, including Parkway, Cub and Checker, but with little success. However, although the 1965 Gateway label release of \"A Little Piece of Leather\" failed to chart in the US, the record became a #27 pop hit when released on the London label in the UK several years later in 1972, and remains a Northern soul favorite.Elbert relocated to the UK in 1966, where he married. There, he recorded \"In Between The Heartaches\" for the Polydor label in 1968, a cover version of the Supremes' hit \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" and an album of Otis Redding cover versions, Tribute To A King. His 1969 Deram release \"Without You\" had a rocksteady rhythm, and went to the top of the Jamaican charts.\nHe returned to the US the same year and had his first US chart hit in over a decade with the Rare Bullet release, \"Can't Get Over Losing You\", which reached #26 on the Billboard R&B chart. The track and its b-side, \"Got To Get Myself Together\", both written by Elbert, were released several times on different labels in subsequent years. After the success of that record, Elbert moved labels for a re-make of the Supremes' 1964 hit, \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" on All Platinum. It became his biggest hit, reaching #15 on the Billboard pop chart, #6 on the R&B chart, and (in 1972) #8 in the UK. Its follow-up, \"Sweet Baby\" reached #30 on the R&B chart in early 1972.\nElbert then signed with Avco-Embassy, where he entered the recording studio with the successful production team of Hugo & Luigi. His cover of the Four Tops' \"I Can't Help Myself\" reached #14 on the Billboard R&B chart, but climbed as high as #2 on the alternative Cashbox R&B chart. Elbert baulked at the label's insistence that he record material associated with Motown and departed with only a few tracks left to record for an album. Even so, the album was released after Avco sold it on to a budget label, Trip.\nHe returned to All Platinum and had a run of minor R&B hits, but left after a disagreement over the claimed authorship of Shirley & Company's R&B chart-topper \"Shame Shame Shame\", which was credited to label owner Sylvia Robinson. Elbert was also involved in a copyright wrangle over Darrell Banks' major R&B and pop hit in 1966, \"Open The Door To Your Heart\". He had originally written the song as \"Baby Walk Right In\" (still its alternative legal title) and given it to Banks, but received no writing credit on the original record. Eventually, the matter was resolved by BMI with a disgruntled Elbert awarded joint authorship with Banks. \"Open The Door\" has since been given award-winning status by BMI and is one of over 100 songs written or co-written by Elbert.\nFor 1975's \"You Keep Me Crying (With Your Lying)\", Elbert formed his own label and \"I Got to Get Myself Together\", appeared on an imprint bearing his surname, but it was among his final recordings.By the mid-1980s, Elbert had retired from performing and became director of A&R for Polygram's Canadian division. He suffered a massive stroke and died in 1989, at the age of 52.\n\nDiscography\nChart singles\nAlbums\nThe Sensational Donnie Elbert Sings (King, 1959)\nTribute to a King (1968)\nWhere Did Our Love Go?

Noting her singing talents, her parents brought their young child to auditions for musical theater productions in New York City. The singer joined Glee clubs at school and formed her own female singing groups at school. At the age of 11, she heard her first \"Rock and Roll\" song. This affected her taste in music and desire to emulate the style; it was the first time she heard a Rock group with a female lead singer. This was significant since she realized that she could be a lead singer.\n\nRecording career\nAt the age of 15, her parents sent her for vocal coaching in Manhattan, N.Y. After a while her coach sent her to record a demonstration record in a sound studio near Broadway. Upon hearing her sing, the sound engineer contacted his friend who was a producer of a small record company in N.Y.C.; he was impressed by her voice and immediately signed her to a contract. The singer's mother co-signed the document since Baron was a fifteen-year-old minor at the time.Baron became one of the many girl group/girl sound singers of the early 1960s. Baron was not a member of a group; her producers would hire \"pay for hire\" backup groups for her recordings. This \"sound\" as it is referred to had much to do with Phil Spector, one of its major creators; Spector produced recordings of this genre prolifically. The groups were composed of young adult or teenage girls, each with a lead singer and any number of back up singers.At the time, the troubled label (a small N.Y.C. record company owned by Wally Zober) could not promote Baron's \"I've Got A Feeling\"/\"Oh Yeah\" 45 vinyl and so she eventually signed a contract with Jerry Goldstein producer of FGG productions, also located in Manhattan. \"Where Did My Jimmy Go\"/\"Tra la la, I Love You\" was the result (Diamond).\n\nLater life\nBaron left the music industry at the age of 19, choosing to enter higher education due to changes in the music industry of those days; she eventually received an advanced degree.\nBaron's \"I've Got a Feeling\" was covered by The Secret Sisters on their 2010 self-titled album as well as being released as a single. AllMusic describes Baron's song as \"an early-'60s pop/rock obscurity\".\nPassage 4:\nJack Carroll (hurler)\nJack Carroll (1921\u20131998) is an Irish hurler who played as a goalkeeper for the Offaly senior hurling team.\nCarroll made his first appearance for the team during the 1943 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1953 championship. During that time he enjoyed little success as Offaly were regarded as one of the minnows of provincial hurling.\nAt club level Carroll was a five-time county club championship medalist with Coolderry.\nCarroll's father-in-law, \"Red\" Jack Teehan, his son, Pat Carroll, and his grandson, Brian Carroll, also played hurling with Offaly.\nPassage 5:\nAndrew Allen (singer)\nAndrew Allen (born 6 May 1981) is a Canadian singer-songwriter from Vernon, British Columbia. He is signed to Sony/ATV and has released five top ten singles, and written and recorded many others, including Where Did We Go? with Carly Rae Jepsen. He also records covers and posts them on YouTube.\n\nBackground\nRaised in British Columbia's Okanagan Valley, his acoustic pop/rock music is inspired by artists like Jason Mraz and Jack Johnson.\n\nCareer\nAndrew Allen scored his first hit in 2009, when I Wanna Be Your Christmas cracked the Top Ten in his native Canada. He was honored as the feature performer for the Sochi 2014 hand off finale on the internationally broadcast Closing Ceremony of the 2010 Paralympic Winter Games held at Whistler, British Columbia. Allen continued building an international profile in 2010, and released his biggest single Loving You Tonight, which sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide, was featured on the Gold Selling NOW 37, hit #6 on the Canadian charts for 22 weeks in a row and #30 on the US Hot AC charts, and got him a record deal with Epic after spending much of that year on the road. Because of the song's attention, Allen had the opportunity to perform with some of the world's biggest artists like Bruno Mars, One Republic, The Barenaked Ladies, Train, Matt Nathanson, Joshua Radin, Andy Grammer, The Script, Nick Carter, Kris Allen, Carly Rae Jepsen and many others.\nLoving You Tonight was also featured on the soundtrack of Abduction starring Taylor Lautner.\n\nCollaborations\nAndrew Allen is also well known in the songwriting community, and has written songs with artists like Meghan Trainor, Rachel Platten, Cody Simpson, Carly Rae Jepsen, Matt Simons, Conrad Sewell as well as writer/producers like Toby Gad, Ryan Stewart, Eric Rosse, Jason Reeves, John Shanks, Nolan Sipes, Mark Pellizzer (Magic), Brian West and Josh Cumbee. Numerous songs he has been a part of writing have been released by various artists, including Last Chance, which was on the Grammy nominated album Atmosphere by Kaskade feat.

Her elder sisters were Theresa Elizabeth Perez (1924\u20132001), a classically trained musician and the producer/founder of the People's Pops Concerts in Phoenix, Arizona, and journalist Kathleen Moira Carroll (1927\u20132007).Carroll attended Clerkhill Notre Dame High School, a Roman Catholic convent school in Dumbarton.\n\nStage career\nCarroll received her acting training at the Central School which later became the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art London, appearing in three plays in London's West End and a film, Midnight Episode, by age 20. She made her Broadway debut in Separate Tables by Terence Rattigan. She moved to the U.S. during the 1950s, touring and performing on Broadway and co-founded, with Dermot McNamara, The Irish Players, a repertory theater company in Manhattan.Helena split her stage work between Dublin, London and New York, appearing on Broadway in, among other productions the original production of Oliver! as Mrs. Sowerberry, as well as Pickwick, Design for Living, Waiting in the Wings, and the Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton revival of Private Lives (New York and Los Angeles). Her last stage performance was in 2007 at the age of 78.\n\nFilm and television\nCarroll played the leading role of Nora, in a television production of her father's play, The White Steed (1959 Play of the Week Series), directed by Joe Gisterak.

Out. What Did You Do? Nothing.\n\nBiography\nRobert Paul Smith was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Mount Vernon, NY, and graduated from Columbia College in 1936.

It was later made into a movie starring Frank Sinatra and Debbie Reynolds. A classic example of the \"battle-of-the-sexes\" comedy, it revolves around the mutual envy of a bachelor living in New York City and a settled family man living in the New York suburbs.\nWhere Did You Go? Out. What Did You Do? Nothing is a nostalgic evocation of the inner life of childhood. It advocates the value of privacy to children; the importance of unstructured time; the joys of boredom; and the virtues of freedom from adult supervision. He opens by saying \"The thing is, I don't understand what kids do with themselves any more.\" He contrasts the overstructured, overscheduled, oversupervised suburban life of the child in the suburban 1950's with reminiscences of his own childhood. He concludes \"I guess what I am saying is that people who don't have nightmares don't have dreams. If you will excuse me, I have an appointment with myself to sit on the front steps and watch some grass growing.\"\nTranslations from the English (1958) collects a series of articles originally published in Good Housekeeping magazine. The first, \"Translations from the Children,\" may be the earliest known example of the genre of humor that consists of a series of translations from what is said (e.g. \"I don't know why. He just hit me\") into what is meant (e.g. \"He hit his brother.\")\nHow to Do Nothing With Nobody All Alone By Yourself (1958) is a how-to book, illustrated by Robert Paul Smith's wife Elinor Goulding Smith. It gives step-by-step directions on how to: play mumbly-peg; build a spool tank; make polly-noses; construct an indoor boomerang, etc. It was republished in 2010 by Tin House Books.\n\nList of works\nEssays and humor\nWhere Did You Go?

While Joel would like to fight, Jonathan is waiting for salvation from God.\nAfter Dismas one day watched with enthusiasm a demon exorcism by Jesus, he and Joel also bring Jonathan to Jesus. They let Jonathan down through the ceiling of the house to Jesus; Jonathan is healed.\nIn the meantime, Joel meets the stranger Omah, whose family was cruelly killed by the Romans.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art.

Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 6:\nMichael Govan\nMichael Govan (born 1963) is the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Prior to his current position, Govan worked as the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York City.\n\nEarly life and education\nGovan was born in 1963 in North Adams, Massachusetts, and was raised in the Washington D.C. area, attending Sidwell Friends School.He majored in art history and fine arts at Williams College, where he met Thomas Krens, who was then director of the Williams College Museum of Art. Govan became closely involved with the museum, serving as acting curator as an undergraduate. After receiving his B.A. from Williams in 1985, Govan began an MFA in fine arts from the University of California, San Diego.\n\nCareer\nAs a twenty-five year old graduate student, Govan was recruited by his former mentor at Williams, Thomas Krens, who in 1988 had been appointed director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Govan served as deputy director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum under Krens from 1988 to 1994, a period that culminated in the construction and opening of the Frank Gehry designed Guggenheim branch in Bilbao, Spain. Govan supervised the reinstallation of the museum's permanent collection galleries after its extensive renovation.\n\nDia Art Foundation\nFrom 1994 to 2006, Govan was president and director of Dia Art Foundation in New York City. There, he spearheaded the conversion of a Nabisco box factory into the 300,000 square foot Dia:Beacon in New York's Hudson Valley, which houses Dia's collection of art from the 1960s to the present. Built in a former Nabisco box factory, the critically acclaimed museum has been credited with catalyzing a cultural and economic revival within the formerly factory-based city of Beacon. Dia's collection nearly doubled in size during Govan's tenure, but he also came under criticism for \"needlessly and permanently\" closing Dia's West 22nd Street building. During his time at Dia, Govan also worked closely with artists James Turrell and Michael Heizer, becoming an ardent supporter of Roden Crater and City, the artists' respective site-specific land art projects under construction in the American southwest. Govan successfully lobbied Washington to have the 704,000 acres in central Nevada surrounding City declared a national monument in 2015.\n\nLACMA\nIn February 2006, a search committee composed of eleven LACMA trustees, led by the late Nancy M. Daly, recruited Govan to run the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Govan has stated that he was drawn to the role not only because of LACMA's geographical distance from its European and east coast peers, but also because of the museum's relative youth, having been established in 1961. \"I felt that because of this newness I had the opportunity to reconsider the museum,\" Govan has written, \"[and] Los Angeles is a good place to do that.\"Govan has been widely regarded for transforming LACMA into both a local and international landmark. Since Govan's arrival, LACMA has acquired by donation or purchase over 27,000 works for the permanent collection, and the museum's gallery space has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new buildings designed by Renzo Piano, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) and the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Pavilion. LACMA's annual attendance has grown from 600,000 to nearly 1.6 million in 2016.\n\nArtist collaborations\nSince his arrival, Govan has commissioned exhibition scenography and gallery designs in collaboration with artists. In 2006, for example, Govan invited LA artist John Baldessari to design an upcoming exhibition about the Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte, resulting in a theatrical show that reflected the twisted perspective of the latter's topsy-turvy world. Baldessari has also designed LACMA's logo. Since then, Govan has also commissioned Cuban-American artist Jorge Pardo to design LACMA's Art of the Ancient Americas gallery, described in the Los Angeles Times as a \"gritty cavern deep inside the earth ... crossed with a high-style urban lounge.\"Govan has also commissioned several large-scale public artworks for LACMA's campus from contemporary California artists. These include Chris Burden's Urban Light (2008), a series of 202 vintage street lamps from different neighborhoods in Los Angeles, arranged in front of the entrance pavilion, Barbara Kruger's Untitled (Shafted) (2008), Robert Irwin's Primal Palm Garden (2010), and Michael Heizer's Levitated Mass, a 340-ton boulder transported 100 miles from the Jurupa Valley to LACMA, a widely publicized journey that culminated with a large celebration on Wilshire Boulevard. Thanks in part to the popularity of these public artworks, LACMA was ranked the fourth most instagrammed museum in the world in 2016.In his first three full years, the museum raised $251 million\u2014about $100 million more than it collected during the three years before he arrived. In 2010, it was announced that Govan will steer LACMA for at least six more years. In a letter dated February 24, 2013, Govan, along with the LACMA board's co-chairmen Terry Semel and Andrew Gordon, proposed a merger with the financially troubled Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and a plan to raise $100 million for the combined museum.\n\nZumthor Project\nGovan's latest project is an ambitious building project, the replacement of four of the campus's aging buildings with a single new state of the art gallery building designed by architect Peter Zumthor. As of January 2017, he has raised about $300 million in commitments. Construction is expected to begin in 2018, and the new building will open in 2023, to coincide with the opening of the new D Line metro stop on Wilshire Boulevard. The project also envisages dissolving all existing curatorial departments and departmental collections. Some commentators have been highly critical of Govan's plans. Joseph Giovannini, recalling Govan's technically unrealizable onetime plan to hang Jeff Koons' Train sculpture from the facade of the Ahmanson Gallery, has accused Govan of \"driving the institution over a cliff into an equivalent mid-air wreck of its own\". Describing the collection merging proposal as the creation of a \"giant raffle bowl of some 130,000 objects\", Giovannini also points out that the Zumthor building will contain 33% less gallery space than the galleries it will replace, and that the linear footage of wall space available for displays will decrease by about 7,500 ft, or 1.5 miles. Faced with losing a building named in its honor, and anticipating that its acquisitions could no longer be displayed, the Ahmanson Foundation withdrew its support.\nOn the merging of the separate curatorial divisions to create a non-departmental art museum, Christopher Knight has pointed out that \"no other museum of LACMA's size and complexity does it\" that way, and characterized the museum's 2019 \"To Rome and Back\" exhibition, the first to take place under the new scheme, as \"bland and ineffectual\" and an \"unsuccessful sample of what's to come\".\n\nPersonal life\nGovan is married and has two daughters, one from a previous marriage. He and his family used to live in a $6 million mansion in Hancock Park that was provided by LACMA - a benefit worth $155,000 a year, according to most recent tax filings - until LACMA decided that it would sell the property to make up for the museum's of almost $900 million in debt [2]. That home is now worth nearly $8 million and Govan now lives in a trailer park in Malibu's Point Dume region.\nLos Angeles CA 90020\nUnited States. He has had a private pilot's license since 1995 and keeps a 1979 Beechcraft Bonanza at Santa Monica Airport.\nPassage 7:\nKatherine Stenholm\nKatherine Corne Stenholm (June 19, 1917 \u2013 November 3, 2015) was an American film director and the founding director of Unusual Films, the production company of Bob Jones University.\n\nBiography\nKatherine Corne was born and reared in Hendersonville, North Carolina.  As a high school student during the Depression, she supplemented her family's income by writing movie reviews for a local newspaper.  Rejecting a college scholarship to Wellesley, Corne attended the fledgling Bob Jones College in Cleveland, Tennessee, after an evangelist convinced her that a Christian young person should attend a Christian college.  At BJC, she majored in speech and became a private student of Bob Jones Jr., eventually helping him direct Shakespearean plays.  After earning her undergraduate degree, she served on the BJC speech faculty while attending graduate school at Northwestern University for twelve summers. During this period she married Gilbert R. Stenholm (1915\u201389), who became an influential administrator at the institution; they had one son.In 1950, after the college moved to Greenville and became Bob Jones University, Bob Jones Sr. and Jr. asked Stenholm to head a newly conceived campus film production company, Unusual Films.  Stenholm then attended summer film school at the University of Southern California, making important professional contacts and serving an internship with Stanley Kramer.   Stenholm was a quick learner and soon \"became one of only a handful of women in the United States to direct feature films.\"  Through her career she produced seventy-two films of various types including sermon films, religious documentaries, promotional films, and multi-image presentations.  She directed five feature-length religious films, all costume dramas: \n\nWine of Morning\nRed Runs the River\nFlame in the Wind\nSheffey\nBeyond the Night.The National Evangelical Film Foundation named Stenholm Director of the Year in 1953, 1955, and 1963; and her favorite film, Sheffey, received a Silver Medallion award from the International Film and Television Festival of New York.In 1958, at the height of the Cold War, the University Film Producers Association selected Wine of Morning as its submission to the International Congress of Motion Picture and Television School Directors at the Cannes Film Festival, and Stenholm was the keynote speaker on the occasion. A U.S. State Department official who briefed Stenholm told her there had been a round of applause when the Department discovered that BJU had been chosen to represent the United States because \"Bob Jones University is one school about which there is no worry!\" The selection committee thought Wine of Morning would demonstrate the excellence of American cinema training and the film's frank religious message would \"provide a revealing contrast to the entries from Russia and the other Communist-dominated countries.\"In 1986, Stenholm suffered a stroke in the Soviet Union while taking scenic footage in preparation for another feature-length film.  She retired as director of Unusual Films but continued to teach at BJU until 2001. Stenholm died in November 2015 at the age of 98.\nPassage 8:\nJesse E. Hobson\nJesse Edward Hobson (May 2, 1911 \u2013 November 5, 1970) was the director of SRI International from 1947 to 1955. Prior to SRI, he was the director of the Armour Research Foundation.\n\nEarly life and education\nHobson was born in Marshall, Indiana. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering from Purdue University and a PhD in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology. Hobson was also selected as a nationally outstanding engineer.Hobson married Jessie Eugertha Bell on March 26, 1939, and they had five children.\n\nCareer\nAwards and memberships\nHobson was named an IEEE Fellow in 1948.\nPassage 9:\nOlav Aaraas\nOlav Aaraas (born 10 July 1950) is a Norwegian historian and museum director.\nHe was born in Fredrikstad. From 1982 to 1993 he was the director of Sogn Folk Museum, from 1993 to 2010 he was the director of Maihaugen and from 2001 he has been the director of the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History. In 2010 he was decorated with the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav.\nPassage 10:\nPeter Levin\nPeter Levin is an American director of film, television and theatre.\n\nCareer\nSince 1967, Levin has amassed a large number of credits directing episodic television and television films. Some of his television series credits include Love Is a Many Splendored Thing, James at 15, The Paper Chase, Family, Starsky & Hutch, Lou Grant, Fame, Cagney & Lacey, Law & Order and Judging Amy.Some of his television film credits include Rape and Marriage: The Rideout Case (1980), A Reason to Live (1985), Popeye Doyle (1986), A Killer Among Us (1990), Queen Sized (2008) and among other films. He directed \"Heart in Hiding\", written by his wife Audrey Davis Levin, for which she received an Emmy for Best Day Time Special in the 1970s.\nPrior to becoming a director, Levin worked as an actor in several Broadway productions. He costarred with Susan Strasberg in \"[The Diary of Ann Frank]\" but had to leave the production when he was drafted into the Army. He trained at the Carnegie Mellon University. Eventually becoming a theatre director, he directed productions at the Long Wharf Theatre and the Pacific Resident Theatre Company. He also co-founded the off-off-Broadway Theatre [the Hardware Poets Playhouse] with his wife Audrey Davis Levin and was also an associate artist of The Interact Theatre Company.",

I won\u2019t pretend to have\ntaken his vast measure on that first occasion, but I think I had achieved\na glimpse of what the privilege of his acquaintance might mean for many\npersons in the way of charges accepted.  He had been a great experience,\nand it was this perhaps that had put me into the frame of foreseeing how\nwe should all, sooner or later, have the honour of dealing with him as a\nwhole.  Whatever impression I then received of the amount of this total,\nI had a full enough vision of the patience of the Mulvilles.  He was to\nstay all the winter: Adelaide dropped it in a tone that drew the sting\nfrom the inevitable emphasis.  These excellent people might indeed have\nbeen content to give the circle of hospitality a diameter of six months;\nbut if they didn\u2019t say he was to stay all summer as well it was only\nbecause this was more than they ventured to hope.  I remember that at\ndinner that evening he wore slippers, new and predominantly purple, of\nsome queer carpet-stuff; but the Mulvilles were still in the stage of\nsupposing that he might be snatched from them by higher bidders.  At a\nlater time they grew, poor dears, to fear no snatching; but theirs was a\nfidelity which needed no help from competition to make them proud.\nWonderful indeed as, when all was said, you inevitably pronounced Frank\nSaltram, it was not to be overlooked that the Kent Mulvilles were in\ntheir way still more extraordinary: as striking an instance as could\neasily be encountered of the familiar truth that remarkable men find\nremarkable conveniences.\n\nThey had sent for me from Wimbledon to come out and dine, and there had\nbeen an implication in Adelaide\u2019s note\u2014judged by her notes alone she\nmight have been thought silly\u2014that it was a case in which something\nmomentous was to be determined or done.  I had never known them not be in\na \u201cstate\u201d about somebody, and I dare say I tried to be droll on this\npoint in accepting their invitation.  On finding myself in the presence\nof their latest discovery I had not at first felt irreverence droop\u2014and,\nthank heaven, I have never been absolutely deprived of that alternative\nin Mr. Saltram\u2019s company.  I saw, however\u2014I hasten to declare it\u2014that\ncompared to this specimen their other phoenixes had been birds of\ninconsiderable feather, and I afterwards took credit to myself for not\nhaving even in primal bewilderments made a mistake about the essence of\nthe man.  He had an incomparable gift; I never was blind to it\u2014it dazzles\nme still.  It dazzles me perhaps even more in remembrance than in fact,\nfor I\u2019m not unaware that for so rare a subject the imagination goes to\nsome expense, inserting a jewel here and there or giving a twist to a\nplume.  How the art of portraiture would rejoice in this figure if the\nart of portraiture had only the canvas!  Nature, in truth, had largely\nrounded it, and if memory, hovering about it, sometimes holds her breath,\nthis is because the voice that comes back was really golden.\n\nThough the great man was an inmate and didn\u2019t dress, he kept dinner on\nthis occasion waiting, and the first words he uttered on coming into the\nroom were an elated announcement to Mulville that he had found out\nsomething.  Not catching the allusion and gaping doubtless a little at\nhis face, I privately asked Adelaide what he had found out.  I shall\nnever forget the look she gave me as she replied: \u201cEverything!\u201d  She\nreally believed it.  At that moment, at any rate, he had found out that\nthe mercy of the Mulvilles was infinite.  He had previously of course\ndiscovered, as I had myself for that matter, that their dinners were\nsoign\u00e9s.  Let me not indeed, in saying this, neglect to declare that I\nshall falsify my counterfeit if I seem to hint that there was in his\nnature any ounce of calculation.  He took whatever came, but he never\nplotted for it, and no man who was so much of an absorbent can ever have\nbeen so little of a parasite.  He had a system of the universe, but he\nhad no system of sponging\u2014that was quite hand-to-mouth.  He had fine\ngross easy senses, but it was not his good-natured appetite that wrought\nconfusion.  If he had loved us for our dinners we could have paid with\nour dinners, and it would have been a great economy of finer matter.  I\nmake free in these connexions with the plural possessive because if I was\nnever able to do what the Mulvilles did, and people with still bigger\nhouses and simpler charities, I met, first and last, every demand of\nreflexion, of emotion\u2014particularly perhaps those of gratitude and of\nresentment.  No one, I think, paid the tribute of giving him up so often,\nand if it\u2019s rendering honour to borrow wisdom I\u2019ve a right to talk of my\nsacrifices.  He yielded lessons as the sea yields fish\u2014I lived for a\nwhile on this diet.  Sometimes it almost appeared to me that his massive\nmonstrous failure\u2014if failure after all it was\u2014had been designed for my\nprivate recreation.  He fairly pampered my curiosity; but the history of\nthat experience would take me too far.  This is not the large canvas I\njust now spoke of, and I wouldn\u2019t have approached him with my present\nhand had it been a question of all the features.  Frank Saltram\u2019s\nfeatures, for artistic purposes, are verily the anecdotes that are to be\ngathered.  Their name is legion, and this is only one, of which the\ninterest is that it concerns even more closely several other persons.\nSuch episodes, as one looks back, are the little dramas that made up the\ninnumerable facets of the big drama\u2014which is yet to be reported.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nIT is furthermore remarkable that though the two stories are distinct\u2014my\nown, as it were, and this other\u2014they equally began, in a manner, the\nfirst night of my acquaintance with Frank Saltram, the night I came back\nfrom Wimbledon so agitated with a new sense of life that, in London, for\nthe very thrill of it, I could only walk home.  Walking and swinging my\nstick, I overtook, at Buckingham Gate, George Gravener, and George\nGravener\u2019s story may be said to have begun with my making him, as our\npaths lay together, come home with me for a talk.  I duly remember, let\nme parenthesise, that it was still more that of another person, and also\nthat several years were to elapse before it was to extend to a second\nchapter.  I had much to say to him, none the less, about my visit to the\nMulvilles, whom he more indifferently knew, and I was at any rate so\namusing that for long afterwards he never encountered me without asking\nfor news of the old man of the sea.  I hadn\u2019t said Mr. Saltram was old,\nand it was to be seen that he was of an age to outweather George\nGravener.  I had at that time a lodging in Ebury Street, and Gravener was\nstaying at his brother\u2019s empty house in Eaton Square.  At Cambridge, five\nyears before, even in our devastating set, his intellectual power had\nseemed to me almost awful.  Some one had once asked me privately, with\nblanched cheeks, what it was then that after all such a mind as that left\nstanding.  \u201cIt leaves itself!\u201d I could recollect devoutly replying.  I\ncould smile at present for this remembrance, since before we got to Ebury\nStreet I was struck with the fact that, save in the sense of being well\nset up on his legs, George Gravener had actually ceased to tower.  The\nuniverse he laid low had somehow bloomed again\u2014the usual eminences were\nvisible.  I wondered whether he had lost his humour, or only, dreadful\nthought, had never had any\u2014not even when I had fancied him most\nAristophanesque.  What was the need of appealing to laughter, however, I\ncould enviously enquire, where you might appeal so confidently to\nmeasurement?  Mr. Saltram\u2019s queer figure, his thick nose and hanging lip,\nwere fresh to me: in the light of my old friend\u2019s fine cold symmetry they\npresented mere success in amusing as the refuge of conscious ugliness.\nAlready, at hungry twenty-six, Gravener looked as blank and parliamentary\nas if he were fifty and popular.  In my scrap of a residence\u2014he had a\nworldling\u2019s eye for its futile conveniences, but never a comrade\u2019s joke\u2014I\nsounded Frank Saltram in his ears; a circumstance I mention in order to\nnote that even then I was surprised at his impatience of my enlivenment.\nAs he had never before heard of the personage it took indeed the form of\nimpatience of the preposterous Mulvilles, his relation to whom, like\nmine, had had its origin in an early, a childish intimacy with the young\nAdelaide, the fruit of multiplied ties in the previous generation.  When\nshe married Kent Mulville, who was older than Gravener and I and much\nmore amiable, I gained a friend, but Gravener practically lost one.  We\nreacted in different ways from the form taken by what he called their\ndeplorable social action\u2014the form (the term was also his) of nasty\nsecond-rate gush.  I may have held in my \u2018for int\u00e9rieur\u2019 that the good\npeople at Wimbledon were beautiful fools, but when he sniffed at them I\ncouldn\u2019t help taking the opposite line, for I already felt that even\nshould we happen to agree it would always be for reasons that differed.\nIt came home to me that he was admirably British as, without so much as a\nsociable sneer at my bookbinder, he turned away from the serried rows of\nmy little French library.\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ve never seen the fellow, but it\u2019s clear enough he\u2019s a\nhumbug.\u201d\n\n\u201cClear \u2018enough\u2019 is just what it isn\u2019t,\u201d I replied; \u201cif it only were!\u201d\nThat ejaculation on my part must have been the beginning of what was to\nbe later a long ache for final frivolous rest.  Gravener was profound\nenough to remark after a moment that in the first place he couldn\u2019t be\nanything but a Dissenter, and when I answered that the very note of his\nfascination was his extraordinary speculative breadth my friend retorted\nthat there was no cad like your cultivated cad, and that I might depend\nupon discovering\u2014since I had had the levity not already to have\nenquired\u2014that my shining light proceeded, a generation back, from a\nMethodist cheesemonger.  I confess I was struck with his insistence, and\nI said, after reflexion: \u201cIt may be\u2014I admit it may be; but why on earth\nare you so sure?\u201d\u2014asking the question mainly to lay him the trap of\nsaying that it was because the poor man didn\u2019t dress for dinner.  He took\nan instant to circumvent my trap and come blandly out the other side.\n\n\u201cBecause the Kent Mulvilles have invented him.  They\u2019ve an infallible\nhand for frauds.  All their geese are swans.  They were born to be duped,\nthey like it, they cry for it, they don\u2019t know anything from anything,\nand they disgust one\u2014luckily perhaps!\u2014with Christian charity.\u201d  His\nvehemence was doubtless an accident, but it might have been a strange\nforeknowledge.  I forget what protest I dropped; it was at any rate\nsomething that led him to go on after a moment: \u201cI only ask one\nthing\u2014it\u2019s perfectly simple.  Is a man, in a given case, a real\ngentleman?\u201d\n\n\u201cA real gentleman, my dear fellow\u2014that\u2019s so soon said!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot so soon when he isn\u2019t!  If they\u2019ve got hold of one this time he must\nbe a great rascal!\u201d\n\n\u201cI might feel injured,\u201d I answered, \u201cif I didn\u2019t reflect that they don\u2019t\nrave about me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be too sure!  I\u2019ll grant that he\u2019s a gentleman,\u201d Gravener\npresently added, \u201cif you\u2019ll admit that he\u2019s a scamp.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know which to admire most, your logic or your benevolence.\u201d\n\nMy friend coloured at this, but he didn\u2019t change the subject.  \u201cWhere did\nthey pick him up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they were struck with something he had published.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can fancy the dreary thing!\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe they found out he had all sorts of worries and difficulties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat of course wasn\u2019t to be endured, so they jumped at the privilege of\npaying his debts!\u201d  I professed that I knew nothing about his debts, and\nI reminded my visitor that though the dear Mulvilles were angels they\nwere neither idiots nor millionaires.  What they mainly aimed at was\nreuniting Mr. Saltram to his wife.  \u201cI was expecting to hear he has\nbasely abandoned her,\u201d Gravener went on, at this, \u201cand I\u2019m too glad you\ndon\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d\n\nI tried to recall exactly what Mrs. Mulville had told me.  \u201cHe didn\u2019t\nleave her\u2014no.  It\u2019s she who has left him.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeft him to us?\u201d Gravener asked.  \u201cThe monster\u2014many thanks!  I decline\nto take him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hear more about him in spite of yourself.  I can\u2019t, no, I really\ncan\u2019t resist the impression that he\u2019s a big man.\u201d  I was already\nmastering\u2014to my shame perhaps be it said\u2014just the tone my old friend\nleast liked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s doubtless only a trifle,\u201d he returned, \u201cbut you haven\u2019t happened to\nmention what his reputation\u2019s to rest on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy on what I began by boring you with\u2014his extraordinary mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs exhibited in his writings?\u201d\n\n\u201cPossibly in his writings, but certainly in his talk, which is far and\naway the richest I ever listened to.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s it all about?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow, don\u2019t ask me!  About everything!\u201d I pursued, reminding\nmyself of poor Adelaide.  \u201cAbout his ideas of things,\u201d I then more\ncharitably added.  \u201cYou must have heard him to know what I mean\u2014it\u2019s\nunlike anything that ever was heard.\u201d  I coloured, I admit, I overcharged\na little, for such a picture was an anticipation of Saltram\u2019s later\ndevelopment and still more of my fuller acquaintance with him.  However,\nI really expressed, a little lyrically perhaps, my actual imagination of\nhim when I proceeded to declare that, in a cloud of tradition, of legend,\nhe might very well go down to posterity as the greatest of all great\ntalkers.  Before we parted George Gravener had wondered why such a row\nshould be made about a chatterbox the more and why he should be pampered\nand pensioned.  The greater the wind-bag the greater the calamity.  Out\nof proportion to everything else on earth had come to be this wagging of\nthe tongue.  We were drenched with talk\u2014our wretched age was dying of it.\nI differed from him here sincerely, only going so far as to concede, and\ngladly, that we were drenched with sound.  It was not however the mere\nspeakers who were killing us\u2014it was the mere stammerers.  Fine talk was\nas rare as it was refreshing\u2014the gift of the gods themselves, the one\nstarry spangle on the ragged cloak of humanity.  How many men were there\nwho rose to this privilege, of how many masters of conversation could he\nboast the acquaintance?  Dying of talk?\u2014why we were dying of the lack of\nit!  Bad writing wasn\u2019t talk, as many people seemed to think, and even\ngood wasn\u2019t always to be compared to it.  From the best talk indeed the\nbest writing had something to learn.  I fancifully added that we too\nshould peradventure be gilded by the legend, should be pointed at for\nhaving listened, for having actually heard.  Gravener, who had glanced at\nhis watch and discovered it was midnight, found to all this a retort\nbeautifully characteristic of him.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one little fact to be borne in mind in the presence equally of\nthe best talk and of the worst.\u201d  He looked, in saying this, as if he\nmeant great things, and I was sure he could only mean once more that\nneither of them mattered if a man wasn\u2019t a real gentleman.  Perhaps it\nwas what he did mean; he deprived me however of the exultation of being\nright by putting the truth in a slightly different way.  \u201cThe only thing\nthat really counts for one\u2019s estimate of a person is his conduct.\u201d  He\nhad his watch still in his palm, and I reproached him with unfair play in\nhaving ascertained beforehand that it was now the hour at which I always\ngave in.  My pleasantry so far failed to mollify him that he promptly\nadded that to the rule he had just enunciated there was absolutely no\nexception.\n\n\u201cNone whatever?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me then to try to be good at any price!\u201d I laughed as I went with\nhim to the door.  \u201cI declare I will be, if I have to be horrible!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIF that first night was one of the liveliest, or at any rate was the\nfreshest, of my exaltations, there was another, four years later, that\nwas one of my great discomposures.  Repetition, I well knew by this time,\nwas the secret of Saltram\u2019s power to alienate, and of course one would\nnever have seen him at his finest if one hadn\u2019t seen him in his remorses.\nThey set in mainly at this season and were magnificent, elemental,\norchestral.  I was quite aware that one of these atmospheric disturbances\nwas now due; but none the less, in our arduous attempt to set him on his\nfeet as a lecturer, it was impossible not to feel that two failures were\na large order, as we said, for a short course of five.  This was the\nsecond time, and it was past nine o\u2019clock; the audience, a muster\nunprecedented and really encouraging, had fortunately the attitude of\nblandness that might have been looked for in persons whom the promise of\n(if I\u2019m not mistaken) An Analysis of Primary Ideas had drawn to the\nneighbourhood of Upper Baker Street.  There was in those days in that\nregion a petty lecture-hall to be secured on terms as moderate as the\nfunds left at our disposal by the irrepressible question of the\nmaintenance of five small Saltrams\u2014I include the mother\u2014and one large\none.  By the time the Saltrams, of different sizes, were all maintained\nwe had pretty well poured out the oil that might have lubricated the\nmachinery for enabling the most original of men to appear to maintain\nthem.\n\nIt was I, the other time, who had been forced into the breach, standing\nup there for an odious lamplit moment to explain to half a dozen thin\nbenches, where earnest brows were virtuously void of anything so cynical\nas a suspicion, that we couldn\u2019t so much as put a finger on Mr. Saltram.\nThere was nothing to plead but that our scouts had been out from the\nearly hours and that we were afraid that on one of his walks abroad\u2014he\ntook one, for meditation, whenever he was to address such a company\u2014some\naccident had disabled or delayed him.  The meditative walks were a\nfiction, for he never, that any one could discover, prepared anything but\na magnificent prospectus; hence his circulars and programmes, of which I\npossess an almost complete collection, are the solemn ghosts of\ngenerations never born.  I put the case, as it seemed to me, at the best;\nbut I admit I had been angry, and Kent Mulville was shocked at my want of\npublic optimism.  This time therefore I left the excuses to his more\npractised patience, only relieving myself in response to a direct appeal\nfrom a young lady next whom, in the hall, I found myself sitting.  My\nposition was an accident, but if it had been calculated the reason would\nscarce have eluded an observer of the fact that no one else in the room\nhad an approach to an appearance.  Our philosopher\u2019s \u201ctail\u201d was\ndeplorably limp.  This visitor was the only person who looked at her\nease, who had come a little in the spirit of adventure.  She seemed to\ncarry amusement in her handsome young head, and her presence spoke, a\nlittle mystifyingly, of a sudden extension of Saltram\u2019s sphere of\ninfluence.  He was doing better than we hoped, and he had chosen such an\noccasion, of all occasions, to succumb to heaven knew which of his fond\ninfirmities.  The young lady produced an impression of auburn hair and\nblack velvet, and had on her other hand a companion of obscurer type,\npresumably a waiting-maid.  She herself might perhaps have been a foreign\ncountess, and before she addressed me I had beguiled our sorry interval\nby finding in her a vague recall of the opening of some novel of Madame\nSand.  It didn\u2019t make her more fathomable to pass in a few minutes from\nthis to the certitude that she was American; it simply engendered\ndepressing reflexions as to the possible check to contributions from\nBoston.  She asked me if, as a person apparently more initiated, I would\nrecommend further waiting, and I answered that if she considered I was on\nmy honour I would privately deprecate it.  Perhaps she didn\u2019t; at any\nrate our talk took a turn that prolonged it till she became aware we were\nleft almost alone.  I presently ascertained she knew Mrs. Saltram, and\nthis explained in a manner the miracle.  The brotherhood of the friends\nof the husband was as nothing to the brotherhood, or perhaps I should say\nthe sisterhood, of the friends of the wife.  Like the Kent Mulvilles I\nbelonged to both fraternities, and even better than they I think I had\nsounded the abyss of Mrs. Saltram\u2019s wrongs.  She bored me to extinction,\nand I knew but too well how she had bored her husband; but there were\nthose who stood by her, the most efficient of whom were indeed the\nhandful of poor Saltram\u2019s backers.  They did her liberal justice, whereas\nher mere patrons and partisans had nothing but hatred for our\nphilosopher.  I\u2019m bound to say it was we, however\u2014we of both camps, as it\nwere\u2014who had always done most for her.\n\nI thought my young lady looked rich\u2014I scarcely knew why; and I hoped she\nhad put her hand in her pocket.  I soon made her out, however, not at all\na fine fanatic\u2014she was but a generous, irresponsible enquirer.  She had\ncome to England to see her aunt, and it was at her aunt\u2019s she had met the\ndreary lady we had all so much on our mind.  I saw she\u2019d help to pass the\ntime when she observed that it was a pity this lady wasn\u2019t intrinsically\nmore interesting.  That was refreshing, for it was an article of faith in\nMrs. Saltram\u2019s circle\u2014at least among those who scorned to know her horrid\nhusband\u2014that she was attractive on her merits.  She was in truth a most\nordinary person, as Saltram himself would have been if he hadn\u2019t been a\nprodigy.  The question of vulgarity had no application to him, but it was\na measure his wife kept challenging you to apply.  I hasten to add that\nthe consequences of your doing so were no sufficient reason for his\nhaving left her to starve.  \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to have much force of\ncharacter,\u201d said my young lady; at which I laughed out so loud that my\ndeparting friends looked back at me over their shoulders as if I were\nmaking a joke of their discomfiture.  My joke probably cost Saltram a\nsubscription or two, but it helped me on with my interlocutress.  \u201cShe\nsays he drinks like a fish,\u201d she sociably continued, \u201cand yet she allows\nthat his mind\u2019s wonderfully clear.\u201d  It was amusing to converse with a\npretty girl who could talk of the clearness of Saltram\u2019s mind.  I\nexpected next to hear she had been assured he was awfully clever.  I\ntried to tell her\u2014I had it almost on my conscience\u2014what was the proper\nway to regard him; an effort attended perhaps more than ever on this\noccasion with the usual effect of my feeling that I wasn\u2019t after all very\nsure of it.  She had come to-night out of high curiosity\u2014she had wanted\nto learn this proper way for herself.  She had read some of his papers\nand hadn\u2019t understood them; but it was at home, at her aunt\u2019s, that her\ncuriosity had been kindled\u2014kindled mainly by his wife\u2019s remarkable\nstories of his want of virtue.  \u201cI suppose they ought to have kept me\naway,\u201d my companion dropped, \u201cand I suppose they\u2019d have done so if I\nhadn\u2019t somehow got an idea that he\u2019s fascinating.  In fact Mrs. Saltram\nherself says he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you came to see where the fascination resides?  Well, you\u2019ve seen!\u201d\n\nMy young lady raised fine eyebrows.  \u201cDo you mean in his bad faith?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the extraordinary effects of it; his possession, that is, of some\nquality or other that condemns us in advance to forgive him the\nhumiliation, as I may call it, to which he has subjected us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe humiliation?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy mine, for instance, as one of his guarantors, before you as the\npurchaser of a ticket.\u201d\n\nShe let her charming gay eyes rest on me.  \u201cYou don\u2019t look humiliated a\nbit, and if you did I should let you off, disappointed as I am; for the\nmysterious quality you speak of is just the quality I came to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you can\u2019t \u2018see\u2019 it!\u201d I cried.\n\n\u201cHow then do you get at it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t!  You mustn\u2019t suppose he\u2019s good-looking,\u201d I added.\n\n\u201cWhy his wife says he\u2019s lovely!\u201d\n\nMy hilarity may have struck her as excessive, but I confess it broke out\nafresh.  Had she acted only in obedience to this singular plea, so\ncharacteristic, on Mrs. Saltram\u2019s part, of what was irritating in the\nnarrowness of that lady\u2019s point of view?  \u201cMrs. Saltram,\u201d I explained,\n\u201cundervalues him where he\u2019s strongest, so that, to make up for it\nperhaps, she overpraises him where he\u2019s weak.  He\u2019s not, assuredly,\nsuperficially attractive; he\u2019s middle-aged, fat, featureless save for his\ngreat eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, his great eyes,\u201d said my young lady attentively.  She had evidently\nheard all about his great eyes\u2014the beaux yeux for which alone we had\nreally done it all.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tragic and splendid\u2014lights on a dangerous coast.  But he moves\nbadly and dresses worse, and altogether he\u2019s anything but smart.\u201d\n\nMy companion, who appeared to reflect on this, after a moment appealed.\n\u201cDo you call him a real gentleman?\u201d\n\nI started slightly at the question, for I had a sense of recognising it:\nGeorge Gravener, years before, that first flushed night, had put me face\nto face with it.  It had embarrassed me then, but it didn\u2019t embarrass me\nnow, for I had lived with it and overcome it and disposed of it.  \u201cA real\ngentleman?  Emphatically not!\u201d\n\nMy promptitude surprised her a little, but I quickly felt how little it\nwas to Gravener I was now talking.  \u201cDo you say that because he\u2019s\u2014what do\nyou call it in England?\u2014of humble extraction?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a bit.  His father was a country school-master and his mother the\nwidow of a sexton, but that has nothing to do with it.  I say it simply\nbecause I know him well.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t it an awful drawback?\u201d\n\n\u201cAwful\u2014quite awful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean isn\u2019t it positively fatal?\u201d\n\n\u201cFatal to what?  Not to his magnificent vitality.\u201d\n\nAgain she had a meditative moment.  \u201cAnd is his magnificent vitality the\ncause of his vices?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour questions are formidable, but I\u2019m glad you put them.  I was\nthinking of his noble intellect.  His vices, as you say, have been much\nexaggerated: they consist mainly after all in one comprehensive defect.\u201d\n\n\u201cA want of will?\u201d\n\n\u201cA want of dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t recognise his obligations?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, he recognises them with effusion, especially in public:\nhe smiles and bows and beckons across the street to them.  But when they\npass over he turns away, and he speedily loses them in the crowd.  The\nrecognition\u2019s purely spiritual\u2014it isn\u2019t in the least social.  So he\nleaves all his belongings to other people to take care of.  He accepts\nfavours, loans, sacrifices\u2014all with nothing more deterrent than an agony\nof shame.  Fortunately we\u2019re a little faithful band, and we do what we\ncan.\u201d  I held my tongue about the natural children, engendered, to the\nnumber of three, in the wantonness of his youth.  I only remarked that he\ndid make efforts\u2014often tremendous ones.  \u201cBut the efforts,\u201d I said,\n\u201cnever come to much: the only things that come to much are the\nabandonments, the surrenders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how much do they come to?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right to put it as if we had a big bill to pay, but, as I\u2019ve told\nyou before, your questions are rather terrible.  They come, these mere\nexercises of genius, to a great sum total of poetry, of philosophy, a\nmighty mass of speculation, notation, quotation.  The genius is there,\nyou see, to meet the surrender; but there\u2019s no genius to support the\ndefence.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what is there, after all, at his age, to show?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the way of achievement recognised and reputation established?\u201d I\nasked.  \u201cTo \u2018show\u2019 if you will, there isn\u2019t much, since his writing,\nmostly, isn\u2019t as fine, isn\u2019t certainly as showy, as his talk.  Moreover\ntwo-thirds of his work are merely colossal projects and announcements.\n\u2018Showing\u2019 Frank Saltram is often a poor business,\u201d I went on: \u201cwe\nendeavoured, you\u2019ll have observed, to show him to-night!  However, if he\nhad lectured he\u2019d have lectured divinely.  It would just have been his\ntalk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what would his talk just have been?\u201d\n\nI was conscious of some ineffectiveness, as well perhaps as of a little\nimpatience, as I replied: \u201cThe exhibition of a splendid intellect.\u201d  My\nyoung lady looked not quite satisfied at this, but as I wasn\u2019t prepared\nfor another question I hastily pursued: \u201cThe sight of a great suspended\nswinging crystal\u2014huge lucid lustrous, a block of light\u2014flashing back\nevery impression of life and every possibility of thought!\u201d\n\nThis gave her something to turn over till we had passed out to the dusky\nporch of the hall, in front of which the lamps of a quiet brougham were\nalmost the only thing Saltram\u2019s treachery hadn\u2019t extinguished.  I went\nwith her to the door of her carriage, out of which she leaned a moment\nafter she had thanked me and taken her seat.  Her smile even in the\ndarkness was pretty.  \u201cI do want to see that crystal!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve only to come to the next lecture.\u201d\n\n\u201cI go abroad in a day or two with my aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait over till next week,\u201d I suggested.  \u201cIt\u2019s quite worth it.\u201d\n\nShe became grave.  \u201cNot unless he really comes!\u201d  At which the brougham\nstarted off, carrying her away too fast, fortunately for my manners, to\nallow me to exclaim \u201cIngratitude!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM made a great affair of her right to be informed where her\nhusband had been the second evening he failed to meet his audience.  She\ncame to me to ascertain, but I couldn\u2019t satisfy her, for in spite of my\ningenuity I remained in ignorance.  It wasn\u2019t till much later that I\nfound this had not been the case with Kent Mulville, whose hope for the\nbest never twirled the thumbs of him more placidly than when he happened\nto know the worst.  He had known it on the occasion I speak of\u2014that is\nimmediately after.  He was impenetrable then, but ultimately confessed.\nWhat he confessed was more than I shall now venture to make public.  It\nwas of course familiar to me that Saltram was incapable of keeping the\nengagements which, after their separation, he had entered into with\nregard to his wife, a deeply wronged, justly resentful, quite\nirreproachable and insufferable person.  She often appeared at my\nchambers to talk over his lapses; for if, as she declared, she had washed\nher hands of him, she had carefully preserved the water of this ablution,\nwhich she handed about for analysis.  She had arts of her own of exciting\none\u2019s impatience, the most infallible of which was perhaps her assumption\nthat we were kind to her because we liked her.  In reality her personal\nfall had been a sort of social rise\u2014since I had seen the moment when, in\nour little conscientious circle, her desolation almost made her the\nfashion.  Her voice was grating and her children ugly; moreover she hated\nthe good Mulvilles, whom I more and more loved.  They were the people who\nby doing most for her husband had in the long run done most for herself;\nand the warm confidence with which he had laid his length upon them was a\npressure gentle compared with her stiffer persuadability.  I\u2019m bound to\nsay he didn\u2019t criticise his benefactors, though practically he got tired\nof them; she, however, had the highest standards about eleemosynary\nforms.  She offered the odd spectacle of a spirit puffed up by\ndependence, and indeed it had introduced her to some excellent society.\nShe pitied me for not knowing certain people who aided her and whom she\ndoubtless patronised in turn for their luck in not knowing me.  I dare\nsay I should have got on with her better if she had had a ray of\nimagination\u2014if it had occasionally seemed to occur to her to regard\nSaltram\u2019s expressions of his nature in any other manner than as separate\nsubjects of woe.  They were all flowers of his character, pearls strung\non an endless thread; but she had a stubborn little way of challenging\nthem one after the other, as if she never suspected that he had a\ncharacter, such as it was, or that deficiencies might be organic; the\nirritating effect of a mind incapable of a generalisation.  One might\ndoubtless have overdone the idea that there was a general licence for\nsuch a man; but if this had happened it would have been through one\u2019s\nfeeling that there could be none for such a woman.\n\nI recognised her superiority when I asked her about the aunt of the\ndisappointed young lady: it sounded like a sentence from an\nEnglish-French or other phrase-book.  She triumphed in what she told me\nand she may have triumphed still more in what she withheld.  My friend of\nthe other evening, Miss Anvoy, had but lately come to England; Lady\nCoxon, the aunt, had been established here for years in consequence of\nher marriage with the late Sir Gregory of that name.  She had a house in\nthe Regent\u2019s Park, a Bath-chair and a fernery; and above all she had\nsympathy.  Mrs. Saltram had made her acquaintance through mutual friends.\nThis vagueness caused me to feel how much I was out of it and how large\nan independent circle Mrs. Saltram had at her command.  I should have\nbeen glad to know more about the disappointed young lady, but I felt I\nshould know most by not depriving her of her advantage, as she might have\nmysterious means of depriving me of my knowledge.  For the present,\nmoreover, this experience was stayed, Lady Coxon having in fact gone\nabroad accompanied by her niece.  The niece, besides being immensely\nclever, was an heiress, Mrs. Saltram said; the only daughter and the\nlight of the eyes of some great American merchant, a man, over there, of\nendless indulgences and dollars.  She had pretty clothes and pretty\nmanners, and she had, what was prettier still, the great thing of all.\nThe great thing of all for Mrs. Saltram was always sympathy, and she\nspoke as if during the absence of these ladies she mightn\u2019t know where to\nturn for it.  A few months later indeed, when they had come back, her\ntone perceptibly changed: she alluded to them, on my leading her up to\nit, rather as to persons in her debt for favours received.  What had\nhappened I didn\u2019t know, but I saw it would take only a little more or a\nlittle less to make her speak of them as thankless subjects of social\ncountenance\u2014people for whom she had vainly tried to do something.  I\nconfess I saw how it wouldn\u2019t be in a mere week or two that I should rid\nmyself of the image of Ruth Anvoy, in whose very name, when I learnt it,\nI found something secretly to like.  I should probably neither see her\nnor hear of her again: the knight\u2019s widow (he had been mayor of\nClockborough) would pass away and the heiress would return to her\ninheritance.  I gathered with surprise that she had not communicated to\nhis wife the story of her attempt to hear Mr..Saltram, and I founded this\nreticence on the easy supposition that Mrs. Saltram had fatigued by\noverpressure the spring of the sympathy of which she boasted.  The girl\nat any rate would forget the small adventure, be distracted, take a\nhusband; besides which she would lack occasion to repeat her experiment.\n\nWe clung to the idea of the brilliant course, delivered without an\naccident, that, as a lecturer, would still make the paying public aware\nof our great man, but the fact remained that in the case of an\ninspiration so unequal there was treachery, there was fallacy at least,\nin the very conception of a series.  In our scrutiny of ways and means we\nwere inevitably subject to the old convention of the synopsis, the\nsyllabus, partly of course not to lose the advantage of his grand free\nhand in drawing up such things; but for myself I laughed at our playbills\neven while I stickled for them.  It was indeed amusing work to be\nscrupulous for Frank Saltram, who also at moments laughed about it, so\nfar as the comfort of a sigh so unstudied as to be cheerful might pass\nfor such a sound.  He admitted with a candour all his own that he was in\ntruth only to be depended on in the Mulvilles\u2019 drawing-room.  \u201cYes,\u201d he\nsuggestively allowed, \u201cit\u2019s there, I think, that I\u2019m at my best; quite\nlate, when it gets toward eleven\u2014and if I\u2019ve not been too much worried.\u201d\nWe all knew what too much worry meant; it meant too enslaved for the hour\nto the superstition of sobriety.  On the Saturdays I used to bring my\nportmanteau, so as not to have to think of eleven o\u2019clock trains.  I had\na bold theory that as regards this temple of talk and its altars of\ncushioned chintz, its pictures and its flowers, its large fireside and\nclear lamplight, we might really arrive at something if the Mulvilles\nwould but charge for admission.  Here it was, however, that they\nshamelessly broke down; as there\u2019s a flaw in every perfection this was\nthe inexpugnable refuge of their egotism.  They declined to make their\nsaloon a market, so that Saltram\u2019s golden words continued the sole coin\nthat rang there.  It can have happened to no man, however, to be paid a\ngreater price than such an enchanted hush as surrounded him on his\ngreatest nights.  The most profane, on these occasions, felt a presence;\nall minor eloquence grew dumb.  Adelaide Mulville, for the pride of her\nhospitality, anxiously watched the door or stealthily poked the fire.  I\nused to call it the music-room, for we had anticipated Bayreuth.  The\nvery gates of the kingdom of light seemed to open and the horizon of\nthought to flash with the beauty of a sunrise at sea.\n\nIn the consideration of ways and means, the sittings of our little board,\nwe were always conscious of the creak of Mrs. Saltram\u2019s shoes.  She\nhovered, she interrupted, she almost presided, the state of affairs being\nmostly such as to supply her with every incentive for enquiring what was\nto be done next.  It was the pressing pursuit of this knowledge that, in\nconcatenations of omnibuses and usually in very wet weather, led her so\noften to my door.  She thought us spiritless creatures with editors and\npublishers; but she carried matters to no great effect when she\npersonally pushed into back-shops.  She wanted all moneys to be paid to\nherself: they were otherwise liable to such strange adventures.  They\ntrickled away into the desert\u2014they were mainly at best, alas, a slender\nstream.  The editors and the publishers were the last people to take this\nremarkable thinker at the valuation that has now pretty well come to be\nestablished.  The former were half-distraught between the desire to \u201ccut\u201d\nhim and the difficulty of finding a crevice for their shears; and when a\nvolume on this or that portentous subject was proposed to the latter they\nsuggested alternative titles which, as reported to our friend, brought\ninto his face the noble blank melancholy that sometimes made it handsome.\nThe title of an unwritten book didn\u2019t after all much matter, but some\nmasterpiece of Saltram\u2019s may have died in his bosom of the shudder with\nwhich it was then convulsed.  The ideal solution, failing the fee at Kent\nMulville\u2019s door, would have been some system of subscription to projected\ntreatises with their non-appearance provided for\u2014provided for, I mean, by\nthe indulgence of subscribers.  The author\u2019s real misfortune was that\nsubscribers were so wretchedly literal.  When they tastelessly enquired\nwhy publication hadn\u2019t ensued I was tempted to ask who in the world had\never been so published.  Nature herself had brought him out in voluminous\nform, and the money was simply a deposit on borrowing the work.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nI WAS doubtless often a nuisance to my friends in those years; but there\nwere sacrifices I declined to make, and I never passed the hat to George\nGravener.  I never forgot our little discussion in Ebury Street, and I\nthink it stuck in my throat to have to treat him to the avowal I had\nfound so easy to Mss Anvoy.  It had cost me nothing to confide to this\ncharming girl, but it would have cost me much to confide to the friend of\nmy youth, that the character of the \u201creal gentleman\u201d wasn\u2019t an attribute\nof the man I took such pains for.  Was this because I had already\ngeneralised to the point of perceiving that women are really the\nunfastidious sex?  I knew at any rate that Gravener, already quite in\nview but still hungry and frugal, had naturally enough more ambition than\ncharity.  He had sharp aims for stray sovereigns, being in view most from\nthe tall steeple of Clockborough.  His immediate ambition was to occupy \u00e0\nlui seul the field of vision of that smokily-seeing city, and all his\nmovements and postures were calculated for the favouring angle.  The\nmovement of the hand as to the pocket had thus to alternate gracefully\nwith the posture of the hand on the heart.  He talked to Clockborough in\nshort only less beguilingly than Frank Saltram talked to his electors;\nwith the difference to our credit, however, that we had already voted and\nthat our candidate had no antagonist but himself.  He had more than once\nbeen at Wimbledon\u2014it was Mrs. Mulville\u2019s work not mine\u2014and by the time\nthe claret was served had seen the god descend.  He took more pains to\nswing his censer than I had expected, but on our way back to town he\nforestalled any little triumph I might have been so artless as to express\nby the observation that such a man was\u2014a hundred times!\u2014a man to use and\nnever a man to be used by.  I remember that this neat remark humiliated\nme almost as much as if virtually, in the fever of broken slumbers, I\nhadn\u2019t often made it myself.  The difference was that on Gravener\u2019s part\na force attached to it that could never attach to it on mine.  He was\nable to use people\u2014he had the machinery; and the irony of Saltram\u2019s being\nmade showy at Clockborough came out to me when he said, as if he had no\nmemory of our original talk and the idea were quite fresh to him: \u201cI hate\nhis type, you know, but I\u2019ll be hanged if I don\u2019t put some of those\nthings in.  I can find a place for them: we might even find a place for\nthe fellow himself.\u201d  I myself should have had some fear\u2014not, I need\nscarcely say, for the \u201cthings\u201d themselves, but for some other things very\nnear them; in fine for the rest of my eloquence.\n\nLater on I could see that the oracle of Wimbledon was not in this case so\nappropriate as he would have been had the polities of the gods only\ncoincided more exactly with those of the party.  There was a distinct\nmoment when, without saying anything more definite to me, Gravener\nentertained the idea of annexing Mr. Saltram.  Such a project was\ndelusive, for the discovery of analogies between his body of doctrine and\nthat pressed from headquarters upon Clockborough\u2014the bottling, in a word,\nof the air of those lungs for convenient public uncorking in\ncorn-exchanges\u2014was an experiment for which no one had the leisure.  The\nonly thing would have been to carry him massively about, paid, caged,\nclipped; to turn him on for a particular occasion in a particular\nchannel.  Frank Saltram\u2019s channel, however, was essentially not\ncalculable, and there was no knowing what disastrous floods might have\nensued.  For what there would have been to do The Empire, the great\nnewspaper, was there to look to; but it was no new misfortune that there\nwere delicate situations in which The Empire broke down.  In fine there\nwas an instinctive apprehension that a clever young journalist\ncommissioned to report on Mr. Saltram might never come back from the\nerrand.  No one knew better than George Gravener that that was a time\nwhen prompt returns counted double.  If he therefore found our friend an\nexasperating waste of orthodoxy it was because of his being, as he said,\npoor Gravener, up in the clouds, not because he was down in the dust.\nThe man would have been, just as he was, a real enough gentleman if he\ncould have helped to put in a real gentleman.  Gravener\u2019s great objection\nto the actual member was that he was not one.\n\nLady Coxon had a fine old house, a house with \u201cgrounds,\u201d at Clockborough,\nwhich she had let; but after she returned from abroad I learned from Mrs.\nSaltram that the lease had fallen in and that she had gone down to resume\npossession.  I could see the faded red livery, the big square shoulders,\nthe high-walled garden of this decent abode.  As the rumble of\ndissolution grew louder the suitor would have pressed his suit, and I\nfound myself hoping the politics of the late Mayor\u2019s widow wouldn\u2019t be\nsuch as to admonish her to ask him to dinner; perhaps indeed I went so\nfar as to pray, they would naturally form a bar to any contact.  I tried\nto focus the many-buttoned page, in the daily airing, as he perhaps even\npushed the Bath-chair over somebody\u2019s toes.  I was destined to hear, none\nthe less, through Mrs. Saltram\u2014who, I afterwards learned, was in\ncorrespondence with Lady Coxon\u2019s housekeeper\u2014that Gravener was known to\nhave spoken of the habitation I had in my eye as the pleasantest thing at\nClockborough.  On his part, I was sure, this was the voice not of envy\nbut of experience.  The vivid scene was now peopled, and I could see him\nin the old-time garden with Miss Anvoy, who would be certain, and very\njustly, to think him good-looking.  It would be too much to describe\nmyself as troubled by this play of surmise; but I occur to remember the\nrelief, singular enough, of feeling it suddenly brushed away by an\nannoyance really much greater; an annoyance the result of its happening\nto come over me about that time with a rush that I was simply ashamed of\nFrank Saltram.  There were limits after all, and my mark at last had been\nreached.\n\nI had had my disgusts, if I may allow myself to-day such an expression;\nbut this was a supreme revolt.  Certain things cleared up in my mind,\ncertain values stood out.  It was all very well to have an unfortunate\ntemperament; there was nothing so unfortunate as to have, for practical\npurposes, nothing else.  I avoided George Gravener at this moment and\nreflected that at such a time I should do so most effectually by leaving\nEngland.  I wanted to forget Frank Saltram\u2014that was all.  I didn\u2019t want\nto do anything in the world to him but that.  Indignation had withered on\nthe stalk, and I felt that one could pity him as much as one ought only\nby never thinking of him again.  It wasn\u2019t for anything he had done to\nme; it was for what he had done to the Mulvilles.  Adelaide cried about\nit for a week, and her husband, profiting by the example so signally\ngiven him of the fatal effect of a want of character, left the letter,\nthe drop too much, unanswered.  The letter, an incredible one, addressed\nby Saltram to Wimbledon during a stay with the Pudneys at Ramsgate, was\nthe central feature of the incident, which, however, had many features,\neach more painful than whichever other we compared it with.  The Pudneys\nhad behaved shockingly, but that was no excuse.  Base ingratitude, gross\nindecency\u2014one had one\u2019s choice only of such formulas as that the more\nthey fitted the less they gave one rest.  These are dead aches now, and I\nam under no obligation, thank heaven, to be definite about the business.\nThere are things which if I had had to tell them\u2014well, would have stopped\nme off here altogether.\n\nI went abroad for the general election, and if I don\u2019t know how much, on\nthe Continent, I forgot, I at least know how much I missed, him.  At a\ndistance, in a foreign land, ignoring, abjuring, unlearning him, I\ndiscovered what he had done for me.  I owed him, oh unmistakeably,\ncertain noble conceptions; I had lighted my little taper at his smoky\nlamp, and lo it continued to twinkle.  But the light it gave me just\nshowed me how much more I wanted.  I was pursued of course by letters\nfrom Mrs. Saltram which I didn\u2019t scruple not to read, though quite aware\nher embarrassments couldn\u2019t but be now of the gravest.  I sacrificed to\npropriety by simply putting them away, and this is how, one day as my\nabsence drew to an end, my eye, while I rummaged in my desk for another\npaper, was caught by a name on a leaf that had detached itself from the\npacket.  The allusion was to Miss Anvoy, who, it appeared, was engaged to\nbe married to Mr. George Gravener; and the news was two months old.  A\ndirect question of Mrs. Saltram\u2019s had thus remained unanswered\u2014she had\nenquired of me in a postscript what sort of man this aspirant to such a\nhand might be.  The great other fact about him just then was that he had\nbeen triumphantly returned for Clockborough in the interest of the party\nthat had swept the country\u2014so that I might easily have referred Mrs.\nSaltram to the journals of the day.  Yet when I at last wrote her that I\nwas coming home and would discharge my accumulated burden by seeing her,\nI but remarked in regard to her question that she must really put it to\nMiss Anvoy.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nI HAD almost avoided the general election, but some of its consequences,\non my return, had smartly to be faced.  The season, in London, began to\nbreathe again and to flap its folded wings.  Confidence, under the new\nMinistry, was understood to be reviving, and one of the symptoms, in a\nsocial body, was a recovery of appetite.  People once more fed together,\nand it happened that, one Saturday night, at somebody\u2019s house, I fed with\nGeorge Gravener.  When the ladies left the room I moved up to where he\nsat and begged to congratulate him.  \u201cOn my election?\u201d he asked after a\nmoment; so that I could feign, jocosely, not to have heard of that\ntriumph and to be alluding to the rumour of a victory still more\npersonal.  I dare say I coloured however, for his political success had\nmomentarily passed out of my mind.  What was present to it was that he\nwas to marry that beautiful girl; and yet his question made me conscious\nof some discomposure\u2014I hadn\u2019t intended to put this before everything.  He\nhimself indeed ought gracefully to have done so, and I remember thinking\nthe whole man was in this assumption that in expressing my sense of what\nhe had won I had fixed my thoughts on his \u201cseat.\u201d  We straightened the\nmatter out, and he was so much lighter in hand than I had lately seen him\nthat his spirits might well have been fed from a twofold source.  He was\nso good as to say that he hoped I should soon make the acquaintance of\nMiss Anvoy, who, with her aunt, was presently coming up to town.  Lady\nCoxon, in the country, had been seriously unwell, and this had delayed\ntheir arrival.  I told him I had heard the marriage would be a splendid\none; on which, brightened and humanised by his luck, he laughed and said\n\u201cDo you mean for her?\u201d  When I had again explained what I meant he went\non: \u201cOh she\u2019s an American, but you\u2019d scarcely know it; unless, perhaps,\u201d\nhe added, \u201cby her being used to more money than most girls in England,\neven the daughters of rich men.  That wouldn\u2019t in the least do for a\nfellow like me, you know, if it wasn\u2019t for the great liberality of her\nfather.  He really has been most kind, and everything\u2019s quite\nsatisfactory.\u201d  He added that his eldest brother had taken a tremendous\nfancy to her and that during a recent visit at Coldfield she had nearly\nwon over Lady Maddock.  I gathered from something he dropped later on\nthat the free-handed gentleman beyond the seas had not made a settlement,\nbut had given a handsome present and was apparently to be looked to,\nacross the water, for other favours.  People are simplified alike by\ngreat contentments and great yearnings, and, whether or no it was\nGravener\u2019s directness that begot my own, I seem to recall that in some\nturn taken by our talk he almost imposed it on me as an act of decorum to\nask if Miss Anvoy had also by chance expectations from her aunt.  My\nenquiry drew out that Lady Coxon, who was the oddest of women, would have\nin any contingency to act under her late husband\u2019s will, which was odder\nstill, saddling her with a mass of queer obligations complicated with\nqueer loopholes.  There were several dreary people, Coxon cousins, old\nmaids, to whom she would have more or less to minister.  Gravener\nlaughed, without saying no, when I suggested that the young lady might\ncome in through a loophole; then suddenly, as if he suspected my turning\na lantern on him, he declared quite dryly: \u201cThat\u2019s all rot\u2014one\u2019s moved by\nother springs!\u201d\n\nA fortnight later, at Lady Coxon\u2019s own house, I understood well enough\nthe springs one was moved by.  Gravener had spoken of me there as an old\nfriend, and I received a gracious invitation to dine.  The Knight\u2019s widow\nwas again indisposed\u2014she had succumbed at the eleventh hour; so that I\nfound Miss Anvoy bravely playing hostess without even Gravener\u2019s help,\nsince, to make matters worse, he had just sent up word that the House,\nthe insatiable House, with which he supposed he had contracted for easier\nterms, positively declined to release him.  I was struck with the\ncourage, the grace and gaiety of the young lady left thus to handle the\nfauna and flora of the Regent\u2019s Park.  I did what I could to help her to\nclassify them, after I had recovered from the confusion of seeing her\nslightly disconcerted at perceiving in the guest introduced by her\nintended the gentleman with whom she had had that talk about Frank\nSaltram.  I had at this moment my first glimpse of the fact that she was\na person who could carry a responsibility; but I leave the reader to\njudge of my sense of the aggravation, for either of us, of such a burden,\nwhen I heard the servant announce Mrs. Saltram.  From what immediately\npassed between the two ladies I gathered that the latter had been sent\nfor post-haste to fill the gap created by the absence of the mistress of\nthe house.  \u201cGood!\u201d I remember crying, \u201cshe\u2019ll be put by me;\u201d and my\napprehension was promptly justified.  Mrs. Saltram taken in to dinner,\nand taken in as a consequence of an appeal to her amiability, was Mrs.\nSaltram with a vengeance.  I asked myself what Miss Anvoy meant by doing\nsuch things, but the only answer I arrived at was that Gravener was\nverily fortunate.  She hadn\u2019t happened to tell him of her visit to Upper\nBaker Street, but she\u2019d certainly tell him to-morrow; not indeed that\nthis would make him like any better her having had the innocence to\ninvite such a person as Mrs. Saltram on such an occasion.  It could only\nstrike me that I had never seen a young woman put such ignorance into her\ncleverness, such freedom into her modesty; this, I think, was when, after\ndinner, she said to me frankly, with almost jubilant mirth: \u201cOh you don\u2019t\nadmire Mrs. Saltram?\u201d  Why should I?  This was truly a young person\nwithout guile.  I had briefly to consider before I could reply that my\nobjection to the lady named was the objection often uttered about people\nmet at the social board\u2014I knew all her stories.  Then as Miss Anvoy\nremained momentarily vague I added: \u201cThose about her husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, but there are some new ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone for me.  Ah novelty would be pleasant!\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it appear that of late he has been particularly horrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis fluctuations don\u2019t matter\u201d, I returned, \u201cfor at night all cats are\ngrey.  You saw the shade of this one the night we waited for him\ntogether.  What will you have?  He has no dignity.\u201d\n\nMiss Anvoy, who had been introducing with her American distinctness,\nlooked encouragingly round at some of the combinations she had risked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad I can\u2019t see him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean Gravener won\u2019t let you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t asked him.  He lets me do everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you know he knows him and wonders what some of us see in him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t happened to talk of him,\u201d the girl said.\n\n\u201cGet him to take you some day out to see the Mulvilles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought Mr. Saltram had thrown the Mulvilles over.\u201d\n\n\u201cUtterly.  But that won\u2019t prevent his being planted there again, to bloom\nlike a rose, within a month or two.\u201d\n\nMiss Anvoy thought a moment.  Then, \u201cI should like to see them,\u201d she said\nwith her fostering smile.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tremendously worth it.  You mustn\u2019t miss them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make George take me,\u201d she went on as Mrs. Saltram came up to\ninterrupt us.  She sniffed at this unfortunate as kindly as she had\nsmiled at me and, addressing the question to her, continued: \u201cBut the\nchance of a lecture\u2014one of the wonderful lectures?  Isn\u2019t there another\ncourse announced?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother?  There are about thirty!\u201d I exclaimed, turning away and feeling\nMrs. Saltram\u2019s little eyes in my back.  A few days after this I heard\nthat Gravener\u2019s marriage was near at hand\u2014was settled for Whitsuntide;\nbut as no invitation had reached me I had my doubts, and there presently\ncame to me in fact the report of a postponement.  Something was the\nmatter; what was the matter was supposed to be that Lady Coxon was now\ncritically ill.  I had called on her after my dinner in the Regent\u2019s\nPark, but I had neither seen her nor seen Miss Anvoy.  I forget to-day\nthe exact order in which, at this period, sundry incidents occurred and\nthe particular stage at which it suddenly struck me, making me catch my\nbreath a little, that the progression, the acceleration, was for all the\nworld that of fine drama.  This was probably rather late in the day, and\nthe exact order doesn\u2019t signify.  What had already occurred was some\naccident determining a more patient wait.  George Gravener, whom I met\nagain, in fact told me as much, but without signs of perturbation.  Lady\nCoxon had to be constantly attended to, and there were other good reasons\nas well.  Lady Coxon had to be so constantly attended to that on the\noccasion of a second attempt in the Regent\u2019s Park I equally failed to\nobtain a sight of her niece.  I judged it discreet in all the conditions\nnot to make a third; but this didn\u2019t matter, for it was through Adelaide\nMulville that the side-wind of the comedy, though I was at first\nunwitting, began to reach me.  I went to Wimbledon at times because\nSaltram was there, and I went at others because he wasn\u2019t.  The Pudneys,\nwho had taken him to Birmingham, had already got rid of him, and we had a\nhorrible consciousness of his wandering roofless, in dishonour, about the\nsmoky Midlands, almost as the injured Lear wandered on the storm-lashed\nheath.  His room, upstairs, had been lately done up (I could hear the\ncrackle of the new chintz) and the difference only made his smirches and\nbruises, his splendid tainted genius, the more tragic.  If he wasn\u2019t\nbarefoot in the mire he was sure to be unconventionally shod.  These were\nthe things Adelaide and I, who were old enough friends to stare at each\nother in silence, talked about when we didn\u2019t speak.  When we spoke it\nwas only about the brilliant girl George Gravener was to marry and whom\nhe had brought out the other Sunday.  I could see that this presentation\nhad been happy, for Mrs. Mulville commemorated it after her sole fashion\nof showing confidence in a new relation.  \u201cShe likes me\u2014she likes me\u201d:\nher native humility exulted in that measure of success.  We all knew for\nourselves how she liked those who liked her, and as regards Ruth Anvoy\nshe was more easily won over than Lady Maddock.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nONE of the consequences, for the Mulvilles, of the sacrifices they made\nfor Frank Saltram was that they had to give up their carriage.  Adelaide\ndrove gently into London in a one-horse greenish thing, an early\nVictorian landau, hired, near at hand, imaginatively, from a broken-down\njobmaster whose wife was in consumption\u2014a vehicle that made people turn\nround all the more when her pensioner sat beside her in a soft white hat\nand a shawl, one of the dear woman\u2019s own.  This was his position and I\ndare say his costume when on an afternoon in July she went to return Miss\nAnvoy\u2019s visit.  The wheel of fate had now revolved, and amid silences\ndeep and exhaustive, compunctions and condonations alike unutterable,\nSaltram was reinstated.  Was it in pride or in penance that Mrs. Mulville\nhad begun immediately to drive him about?  If he was ashamed of his\ningratitude she might have been ashamed of her forgiveness; but she was\nincorrigibly capable of liking him to be conspicuous in the landau while\nshe was in shops or with her acquaintance.  However, if he was in the\npillory for twenty minutes in the Regent\u2019s Park\u2014I mean at Lady Coxon\u2019s\ndoor while his companion paid her call\u2014it wasn\u2019t to the further\nhumiliation of any one concerned that she presently came out for him in\nperson, not even to show either of them what a fool she was that she drew\nhim in to be introduced to the bright young American.  Her account of the\nintroduction I had in its order, but before that, very late in the\nseason, under Gravener\u2019s auspices, I met Miss Anvoy at tea at the House\nof Commons.  The member for Clockborough had gathered a group of pretty\nladies, and the Mulvilles were not of the party.  On the great terrace,\nas I strolled off with her a little, the guest of honour immediately\nexclaimed to me: \u201cI\u2019ve seen him, you know\u2014I\u2019ve seen him!\u201d  She told me\nabout Saltram\u2019s call.\n\n\u201cAnd how did you find him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh so strange!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t like him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell till I see him again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to do that?\u201d\n\nShe had a pause.  \u201cImmensely.\u201d\n\nWe went no further; I fancied she had become aware Gravener was looking\nat us.  She turned back toward the knot of the others, and I said:\n\u201cDislike him as much as you will\u2014I see you\u2019re bitten.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitten?\u201d  I thought she coloured a little.\n\n\u201cOh it doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d I laughed; \u201cone doesn\u2019t die of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope I shan\u2019t die of anything before I\u2019ve seen more of Mrs. Mulville.\u201d\nI rejoiced with her over plain Adelaide, whom she pronounced the\nloveliest woman she had met in England; but before we separated I\nremarked to her that it was an act of mere humanity to warn her that if\nshe should see more of Frank Saltram\u2014which would be likely to follow on\nany increase of acquaintance with Mrs. Mulville\u2014she might find herself\nflattening her nose against the clear hard pane of an eternal\nquestion\u2014that of the relative, that of the opposed, importances of virtue\nand brains.  She replied that this was surely a subject on which one took\neverything for granted; whereupon I admitted that I had perhaps expressed\nmyself ill.  What I referred to was what I had referred to the night we\nmet in Upper Baker Street\u2014the relative importance (relative to virtue) of\nother gifts.  She asked me if I called virtue a gift\u2014a thing handed to us\nin a parcel on our first birthday; and I declared that this very enquiry\nproved to me the problem had already caught her by the skirt.  She would\nhave help however, the same help I myself had once had, in resisting its\ntendency to make one cross.\n\n\u201cWhat help do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat of the member for Clockborough.\u201d\n\nShe stared, smiled, then returned: \u201cWhy my idea has been to help him!\u201d\n\nShe had helped him\u2014I had his own word for it that at Clockborough her\nbedevilment of the voters had really put him in.  She would do so\ndoubtless again and again, though I heard the very next month that this\nfine faculty had undergone a temporary eclipse.  News of the catastrophe\nfirst came to me from Mrs. Saltram, and it was afterwards confirmed at\nWimbledon: poor Miss Anvoy was in trouble\u2014great disasters in America had\nsuddenly summoned her home.  Her father, in New York, had suffered\nreverses, lost so much money that it was really vexatious as showing how\nmuch he had had.  It was Adelaide who told me she had gone off alone at\nless than a week\u2019s notice.\n\n\u201cAlone?  Gravener has permitted that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will you have?  The House of Commons!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m afraid I cursed the House of Commons: I was so much interested.  Of\ncourse he\u2019d follow her as soon as he was free to make her his wife; only\nshe mightn\u2019t now be able to bring him anything like the marriage-portion\nof which he had begun by having the virtual promise.  Mrs. Mulville let\nme know what was already said: she was charming, this American girl, but\nreally these American fathers\u2014!  What was a man to do?  Mr. Saltram,\naccording to Mrs. Mulville, was of opinion that a man was never to suffer\nhis relation to money to become a spiritual relation\u2014he was to keep it\nexclusively material.  \u201cMoi pas comprendre!\u201d I commented on this; in\nrejoinder to which Adelaide, with her beautiful sympathy, explained that\nshe supposed he simply meant that the thing was to use it, don\u2019t you\nknow? but not to think too much about it.  \u201cTo take it, but not to thank\nyou for it?\u201d I still more profanely enquired.  For a quarter of an hour\nafterwards she wouldn\u2019t look at me, but this didn\u2019t prevent my asking her\nwhat had been the result, that afternoon\u2014in the Regent\u2019s Park, of her\ntaking our friend to see Miss Anvoy.\n\n\u201cOh so charming!\u201d she answered, brightening.  \u201cHe said he recognised in\nher a nature he could absolutely trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but I\u2019m speaking of the effect on herself.\u201d\n\nMrs. Mulville had to remount the stream.  \u201cIt was everything one could\nwish.\u201d\n\nSomething in her tone made me laugh.  \u201cDo you mean she gave him\u2014a dole?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, since you ask me!\u201d\n\n\u201cRight there on the spot?\u201d\n\nAgain poor Adelaide faltered.  \u201cIt was to me of course she gave it.\u201d\n\nI stared; somehow I couldn\u2019t see the scene.  \u201cDo you mean a sum of\nmoney?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was very handsome.\u201d  Now at last she met my eyes, though I could see\nit was with an effort.  \u201cThirty pounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cStraight out of her pocket?\u201d\n\n\u201cOut of the drawer of a table at which she had been writing.  She just\nslipped the folded notes into my hand.  He wasn\u2019t looking; it was while\nhe was going back to the carriage.\u201d  \u201cOh,\u201d said Adelaide reassuringly, \u201cI\ntake care of it for him!\u201d  The dear practical soul thought my agitation,\nfor I confess I was agitated, referred to the employment of the money.\nHer disclosure made me for a moment muse violently, and I dare say that\nduring that moment I wondered if anything else in the world makes people\nso gross as unselfishness.  I uttered, I suppose, some vague synthetic\ncry, for she went on as if she had had a glimpse of my inward amaze at\nsuch passages.  \u201cI assure you, my dear friend, he was in one of his happy\nhours.\u201d\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t thinking of that.  \u201cTruly indeed these Americans!\u201d I said.\n\u201cWith her father in the very act, as it were, of swindling her\nbetrothed!\u201d\n\nMrs. Mulville stared.  \u201cOh I suppose Mr. Anvoy has scarcely gone\nbankrupt\u2014or whatever he has done\u2014on purpose.  Very likely they won\u2019t be\nable to keep it up, but there it was, and it was a very beautiful\nimpulse.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say Saltram was very fine?\u201d\n\n\u201cBeyond everything.  He surprised even me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I know what you\u2019ve enjoyed.\u201d  After a moment I added: \u201cHad he\nperadventure caught a glimpse of the money in the table-drawer?\u201d\n\nAt this my companion honestly flushed.  \u201cHow can you be so cruel when you\nknow how little he calculates?\u201d\n\n\u201cForgive me, I do know it.  But you tell me things that act on my nerves.\nI\u2019m sure he hadn\u2019t caught a glimpse of anything but some splendid idea.\u201d\n\nMrs. Mulville brightly concurred.  \u201cAnd perhaps even of her beautiful\nlistening face.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps even!  And what was it all about?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis talk?  It was apropos of her engagement, which I had told him about:\nthe idea of marriage, the philosophy, the poetry, the sublimity of it.\u201d\nIt was impossible wholly to restrain one\u2019s mirth at this, and some rude\nripple that I emitted again caused my companion to admonish me.  \u201cIt\nsounds a little stale, but you know his freshness.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf illustration?  Indeed I do!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how he has always been right on that great question.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn what great question, dear lady, hasn\u2019t he been right?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf what other great men can you equally say it?\u2014and that he has never,\nbut never, had a deflexion?\u201d Mrs. Mulville exultantly demanded.\n\nI tried to think of some other great man, but I had to give it up.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t Miss Anvoy express her satisfaction in any less diffident way\nthan by her charming present?\u201d I was reduced to asking instead.\n\n\u201cOh yes, she overflowed to me on the steps while he was getting into the\ncarriage.\u201d  These words somehow brushed up a picture of Saltram\u2019s big\nshawled back as he hoisted himself into the green landau.  \u201cShe said she\nwasn\u2019t disappointed,\u201d Adelaide pursued.\n\nI turned it over.  \u201cDid he wear his shawl?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis shawl?\u201d  She hadn\u2019t even noticed.\n\n\u201cI mean yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe looked very nice, and you know he\u2019s really clean.  Miss Anvoy used\nsuch a remarkable expression\u2014she said his mind\u2019s like a crystal!\u201d\n\nI pricked up my ears.  \u201cA crystal?\u201d\n\n\u201cSuspended in the moral world\u2014swinging and shining and flashing there.\nShe\u2019s monstrously clever, you know.\u201d\n\nI thought again.  \u201cMonstrously!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nGEORGE GRAVENER didn\u2019t follow her, for late in September, after the House\nhad risen, I met him in a railway-carriage.  He was coming up from\nScotland and I had just quitted some relations who lived near Durham.\nThe current of travel back to London wasn\u2019t yet strong; at any rate on\nentering the compartment I found he had had it for some time to himself.\nWe fared in company, and though he had a blue-book in his lap and the\nopen jaws of his bag threatened me with the white teeth of confused\npapers, we inevitably, we even at last sociably conversed.  I saw things\nweren\u2019t well with him, but I asked no question till something dropped by\nhimself made, as it had made on another occasion, an absence of curiosity\ninvidious.  He mentioned that he was worried about his good old friend\nLady Coxon, who, with her niece likely to be detained some time in\nAmerica, lay seriously ill at Clockborough, much on his mind and on his\nhands.\n\n\u201cAh Miss Anvoy\u2019s in America?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer father has got into horrid straits\u2014has lost no end of money.\u201d\n\nI waited, after expressing due concern, but I eventually said: \u201cI hope\nthat raises no objection to your marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone whatever; moreover it\u2019s my trade to meet objections.  But it may\ncreate tiresome delays, of which there have been too many, from various\ncauses, already.  Lady Coxon got very bad, then she got much better.\nThen Mr. Anvoy suddenly began to totter, and now he seems quite on his\nback.  I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s really in for some big reverse.  Lady Coxon\u2019s\nworse again, awfully upset by the news from America, and she sends me\nword that she _must_ have Ruth.  How can I supply her with Ruth?  I\nhaven\u2019t got Ruth myself!\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely you haven\u2019t lost her?\u201d I returned.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s everything to her wretched father.  She writes me every\npost\u2014telling me to smooth her aunt\u2019s pillow.  I\u2019ve other things to\nsmooth; but the old lady, save for her servants, is really alone.  She\nwon\u2019t receive her Coxon relations\u2014she\u2019s angry at so much of her money\ngoing to them.  Besides, she\u2019s hopelessly mad,\u201d said Gravener very\nfrankly.\n\nI don\u2019t remember whether it was this, or what it was, that made me ask if\nshe hadn\u2019t such an appreciation of Mrs. Saltram as might render that\nactive person of some use.\n\nHe gave me a cold glance, wanting to know what had put Mrs. Saltram into\nmy head, and I replied that she was unfortunately never out of it.  I\nhappened to remember the wonderful accounts she had given me of the\nkindness Lady Coxon had shown her.  Gravener declared this to be false;\nLady Coxon, who didn\u2019t care for her, hadn\u2019t seen her three times.  The\nonly foundation for it was that Miss Anvoy, who used, poor girl, to chuck\nmoney about in a manner she must now regret, had for an hour seen in the\nmiserable woman\u2014you could never know what she\u2019d see in people\u2014an\ninteresting pretext for the liberality with which her nature overflowed.\nBut even Miss Anvoy was now quite tired of her.  Gravener told me more\nabout the crash in New York and the annoyance it had been to him, and we\nalso glanced here and there in other directions; but by the time we got\nto Doncaster the principal thing he had let me see was that he was\nkeeping something back.  We stopped at that station, and, at the\ncarriage-door, some one made a movement to get in.  Gravener uttered a\nsound of impatience, and I felt sure that but for this I should have had\nthe secret.  Then the intruder, for some reason, spared us his company;\nwe started afresh, and my hope of a disclosure returned.  My companion\nheld his tongue, however, and I pretended to go to sleep; in fact I\nreally dozed for discouragement.  When I reopened my eyes he was looking\nat me with an injured air.  He tossed away with some vivacity the remnant\nof a cigarette and then said: \u201cIf you\u2019re not too sleepy I want to put you\na case.\u201d  I answered that I\u2019d make every effort to attend, and welcomed\nthe note of interest when he went on: \u201cAs I told you a while ago, Lady\nCoxon, poor dear, is demented.\u201d  His tone had much behind it\u2014was full of\npromise.  I asked if her ladyship\u2019s misfortune were a trait of her malady\nor only of her character, and he pronounced it a product of both.  The\ncase he wanted to put to me was a matter on which it concerned him to\nhave the impression\u2014the judgement, he might also say\u2014of another person.\n\u201cI mean of the average intelligent man, but you see I take what I can\nget.\u201d There would be the technical, the strictly legal view; then there\nwould be the way the question would strike a man of the world.  He had\nlighted another cigarette while he talked, and I saw he was glad to have\nit to handle when he brought out at last, with a laugh slightly\nartificial: \u201cIn fact it\u2019s a subject on which Miss Anvoy and I are pulling\ndifferent ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you want me to decide between you?  I decide in advance for Miss\nAnvoy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn advance\u2014that\u2019s quite right.  That\u2019s how I decided when I proposed to\nher.  But my story will interest you only so far as your mind isn\u2019t made\nup.\u201d  Gravener puffed his cigarette a minute and then continued: \u201cAre you\nfamiliar with the idea of the Endowment of Research?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf Research?\u201d I was at sea a moment.\n\n\u201cI give you Lady Coxon\u2019s phrase.  She has it on the brain.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wishes to endow\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome earnest and \u2018loyal\u2019 seeker,\u201d Gravener said.  \u201cIt was a sketchy\ndesign of her late husband\u2019s, and he handed it on to her; setting apart\nin his will a sum of money of which she was to enjoy the interest for\nlife, but of which, should she eventually see her opportunity\u2014the matter\nwas left largely to her discretion\u2014she would best honour his memory by\ndetermining the exemplary public use.  This sum of money, no less than\nthirteen thousand pounds, was to be called The Coxon Fund; and poor Sir\nGregory evidently proposed to himself that The Coxon Fund should cover\nhis name with glory\u2014be universally desired and admired.  He left his wife\na full declaration of his views, so far at least as that term may be\napplied to views vitiated by a vagueness really infantine.  A little\nlearning\u2019s a dangerous thing, and a good citizen who happens to have been\nan ass is worse for a community than bad sewerage.  He\u2019s worst of all\nwhen he\u2019s dead, because then he can\u2019t be stopped.  However, such as they\nwere, the poor man\u2019s aspirations are now in his wife\u2019s bosom, or\nfermenting rather in her foolish brain: it lies with her to carry them\nout.  But of course she must first catch her hare.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer earnest loyal seeker?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe flower that blushes unseen for want of such a pecuniary independence\nas may aid the light that\u2019s in it to shine upon the human race.  The\nindividual, in a word, who, having the rest of the machinery, the\nspiritual, the intellectual, is most hampered in his search.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis search for what?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Moral Truth.  That\u2019s what Sir Gregory calls it.\u201d\n\nI burst out laughing.  \u201cDelightful munificent Sir Gregory!  It\u2019s a\ncharming idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Miss Anvoy thinks.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas she a candidate for the Fund?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that I know of\u2014and she\u2019s perfectly reasonable about it.  But Lady\nCoxon has put the matter before her, and we\u2019ve naturally had a lot of\ntalk.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk that, as you\u2019ve so interestingly intimated, has landed you in a\ndisagreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe considers there\u2019s something in it,\u201d Gravener said.\n\n\u201cAnd you consider there\u2019s nothing?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems to me a piece of solemn twaddle\u2014which can\u2019t fail to be attended\nwith consequences certainly grotesque and possibly immoral.  To begin\nwith, fancy constituting an endowment without establishing a tribunal\u2014a\nbench of competent people, of judges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sole tribunal is Lady Coxon?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd any one she chooses to invite.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she has invited you,\u201d I noted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not competent\u2014I hate the thing.  Besides, she hasn\u2019t,\u201d my friend\nwent on.  \u201cThe real history of the matter, I take it, is that the\ninspiration was originally Lady Coxon\u2019s own, that she infected him with\nit, and that the flattering option left her is simply his tribute to her\nbeautiful, her aboriginal enthusiasm.  She came to England forty years\nago, a thin transcendental Bostonian, and even her odd happy frumpy\nClockborough marriage never really materialised her.  She feels indeed\nthat she has become very British\u2014as if that, as a process, as a \u2018Werden,\u2019\nas anything but an original sign of grace, were conceivable; but it\u2019s\nprecisely what makes her cling to the notion of the \u2018Fund\u2019\u2014cling to it as\nto a link with the ideal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can she cling if she\u2019s dying?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean how can she act in the matter?\u201d Gravener asked.  \u201cThat\u2019s\nprecisely the question.  She can\u2019t!  As she has never yet caught her\nhare, never spied out her lucky impostor\u2014how should she, with the life\nshe has led?\u2014her husband\u2019s intention has come very near lapsing.  His\nidea, to do him justice, was that it _should_ lapse if exactly the right\nperson, the perfect mixture of genius and chill penury, should fail to\nturn up.  Ah the poor dear woman\u2019s very particular\u2014she says there must be\nno mistake.\u201d\n\nI found all this quite thrilling\u2014I took it in with avidity.  \u201cAnd if she\ndies without doing anything, what becomes of the money?\u201d I demanded.\n\n\u201cIt goes back to his family, if she hasn\u2019t made some other disposition of\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe may do that then\u2014she may divert it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer hands are not tied.  She has a grand discretion.  The proof is that\nthree months ago she offered to make the proceeds over to her niece.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Miss Anvoy\u2019s own use?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Miss Anvoy\u2019s own use\u2014on the occasion of her prospective marriage.\nShe was discouraged\u2014the earnest seeker required so earnest a search.  She\nwas afraid of making a mistake; every one she could think of seemed\neither not earnest enough or not poor enough.  On the receipt of the\nfirst bad news about Mr. Anvoy\u2019s affairs she proposed to Ruth to make the\nsacrifice for her.  As the situation in New York got worse she repeated\nher proposal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich Miss Anvoy declined?\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept as a formal trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean except as committing herself legally to place the money?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the head of the deserving object, the great man frustrated,\u201d said\nGravener.  \u201cShe only consents to act in the spirit of Sir Gregory\u2019s\nscheme.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you blame her for that?\u201d I asked with some intensity.\n\nMy tone couldn\u2019t have been harsh, but he coloured a little and there was\na queer light in his eye.  \u201cMy dear fellow, if I \u2018blamed\u2019 the young lady\nI\u2019m engaged to I shouldn\u2019t immediately say it even to so old a friend as\nyou.\u201d  I saw that some deep discomfort, some restless desire to be sided\nwith, reassuringly, approvingly mirrored, had been at the bottom of his\ndrifting so far, and I was genuinely touched by his confidence.  It was\ninconsistent with his habits; but being troubled about a woman was not,\nfor him, a habit: that itself was an inconsistency.  George Gravener\ncould stand straight enough before any other combination of forces.  It\namused me to think that the combination he had succumbed to had an\nAmerican accent, a transcendental aunt and an insolvent father; but all\nmy old loyalty to him mustered to meet this unexpected hint that I could\nhelp him.  I saw that I could from the insincere tone in which he\npursued: \u201cI\u2019ve criticised her of course, I\u2019ve contended with her, and it\nhas been great fun.\u201d  Yet it clearly couldn\u2019t have been such great fun as\nto make it improper for me presently to ask if Miss Anvoy had nothing at\nall settled on herself.  To this he replied that she had only a trifle\nfrom her mother\u2014a mere four hundred a year, which was exactly why it\nwould be convenient to him that she shouldn\u2019t decline, in the face of\nthis total change in her prospects, an accession of income which would\ndistinctly help them to marry.  When I enquired if there were no other\nway in which so rich and so affectionate an aunt could cause the weight\nof her benevolence to be felt, he answered that Lady Coxon was\naffectionate indeed, but was scarcely to be called rich.  She could let\nher project of the Fund lapse for her niece\u2019s benefit, but she couldn\u2019t\ndo anything else.  She had been accustomed to regard her as tremendously\nprovided for, and she was up to her eyes in promises to anxious Coxons.\nShe was a woman of an inordinate conscience, and her conscience was now a\ndistress to her, hovering round her bed in irreconcilable forms of\nresentful husbands, portionless nieces and undiscoverable philosophers.\n\nWe were by this time getting into the whirr of fleeting platforms, the\nmultiplication of lights.  \u201cI think you\u2019ll find,\u201d I said with a laugh,\n\u201cthat your predicament will disappear in the very fact that the\nphilosopher _is_ undiscoverable.\u201d\n\nHe began to gather up his papers.  \u201cWho can set a limit to the ingenuity\nof an extravagant woman?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, after all, who indeed?\u201d I echoed as I recalled the extravagance\ncommemorated in Adelaide\u2019s anecdote of Miss Anvoy and the thirty pounds.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nTHE thing I had been most sensible of in that talk with George Gravener\nwas the way Saltram\u2019s name kept out of it.  It seemed to me at the time\nthat we were quite pointedly silent about him; but afterwards it appeared\nmore probable there had been on my companion\u2019s part no conscious\navoidance.  Later on I was sure of this, and for the best of reasons\u2014the\nsimple reason of my perceiving more completely that, for evil as well as\nfor good, he said nothing to Gravener\u2019s imagination.  That honest man\ndidn\u2019t fear him\u2014he was too much disgusted with him.  No more did I,\ndoubtless, and for very much the same reason.  I treated my friend\u2019s\nstory as an absolute confidence; but when before Christmas, by Mrs.\nSaltram, I was informed of Lady Coxon\u2019s death without having had news of\nMiss Anvoy\u2019s return, I found myself taking for granted we should hear no\nmore of these nuptials, in which, as obscurely unnatural, I now saw I had\nnever _too_ disconcertedly believed.  I began to ask myself how people\nwho suited each other so little could please each other so much.  The\ncharm was some material charm, some afffinity, exquisite doubtless, yet\nsuperficial some surrender to youth and beauty and passion, to force and\ngrace and fortune, happy accidents and easy contacts.  They might dote on\neach other\u2019s persons, but how could they know each other\u2019s souls?  How\ncould they have the same prejudices, how could they have the same\nhorizon?  Such questions, I confess, seemed quenched but not answered\nwhen, one day in February, going out to Wimbledon, I found our young lady\nin the house.  A passion that had brought her back across the wintry\nocean was as much of a passion as was needed.  No impulse equally strong\nindeed had drawn George Gravener to America; a circumstance on which,\nhowever, I reflected only long enough to remind myself that it was none\nof my business.  Ruth Anvoy was distinctly different, and I felt that the\ndifference was not simply that of her marks of mourning.  Mrs. Mulville\ntold me soon enough what it was: it was the difference between a handsome\ngirl with large expectations and a handsome girl with only four hundred a\nyear.  This explanation indeed didn\u2019t wholly content me, not even when I\nlearned that her mourning had a double cause\u2014learned that poor Mr. Anvoy,\ngiving way altogether, buried under the ruins of his fortune and leaving\nnext to nothing, had died a few weeks before.\n\n\u201cSo she has come out to marry George Gravener?\u201d I commented.  \u201cWouldn\u2019t\nit have been prettier of him to have saved her the trouble?\u201d\n\n\u201cHasn\u2019t the House just met?\u201d Adelaide replied.  \u201cAnd for Mr. Gravener the\nHouse\u2014!\u201d  Then she added: \u201cI gather that her having come is exactly a\nsign that the marriage is a little shaky.  If it were quite all right a\nself-respecting girl like Ruth would have waited for him over there.\u201d\n\nI noted that they were already Ruth and Adelaide, but what I said was:\n\u201cDo you mean she\u2019ll have had to return to _make_ it so?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I mean that she must have come out for some reason independent of\nit.\u201d  Adelaide could only surmise, however, as yet, and there was more,\nas we found, to be revealed.  Mrs. Mulville, on hearing of her arrival,\nhad brought the young lady out in the green landau for the Sunday.  The\nCoxons were in possession of the house in Regent\u2019s Park, and Miss Anvoy\nwas in dreary lodgings.  George Gravener had been with her when Adelaide\ncalled, but had assented graciously enough to the little visit at\nWimbledon.  The carriage, with Mr. Saltram in it but not mentioned, had\nbeen sent off on some errand from which it was to return and pick the\nladies up.  Gravener had left them together, and at the end of an hour,\non the Saturday afternoon, the party of three had driven out to\nWimbledon.  This was the girl\u2019s second glimpse of our great man, and I\nwas interested in asking Mrs. Mulville if the impression made by the\nfirst appeared to have been confirmed.  On her replying after\nconsideration, that of course with time and opportunity it couldn\u2019t fail\nto be, but that she was disappointed, I was sufficiently struck with her\nuse of this last word to question her further.\n\n\u201cDo you mean you\u2019re disappointed because you judge Miss Anvoy to be?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; I hoped for a greater effect last evening.  We had two or three\npeople, but he scarcely opened his mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be all the better to-night,\u201d I opined after a moment.  Then I\npursued: \u201cWhat particular importance do you attach to the idea of her\nbeing impressed?\u201d\n\nAdelaide turned her mild pale eyes on me as for rebuke of my levity.\n\u201cWhy the importance of her being as happy as _we_ are!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m afraid that at this my levity grew.  \u201cOh that\u2019s a happiness almost\ntoo great to wish a person!\u201d  I saw she hadn\u2019t yet in her mind what I had\nin mine, and at any rate the visitor\u2019s actual bliss was limited to a walk\nin the garden with Kent Mulville.  Later in the afternoon I also took\none, and I saw nothing of Miss Anvoy till dinner, at which we failed of\nthe company of Saltram, who had caused it to be reported that he was\nindisposed and lying down.  This made us, most of us\u2014for there were other\nfriends present\u2014convey to each other in silence some of the unutterable\nthings that in those years our eyes had inevitably acquired the art of\nexpressing.  If a fine little American enquirer hadn\u2019t been there we\nwould have expressed them otherwise, and Adelaide would have pretended\nnot to hear.  I had seen her, before the very fact, abstract herself\nnobly; and I knew that more than once, to keep it from the servants,\nmanaging, dissimulating cleverly, she had helped her husband to carry him\nbodily to his room.  Just recently he had been so wise and so deep and so\nhigh that I had begun to get nervous\u2014to wonder if by chance there were\nsomething behind it, if he were kept straight for instance by the\nknowledge that the hated Pudneys would have more to tell us if they\nchose.  He was lying low, but unfortunately it was common wisdom with us\nin this connexion that the biggest splashes took place in the quietest\npools.  We should have had a merry life indeed if all the splashes had\nsprinkled us as refreshingly as the waters we were even then to feel\nabout our ears.  Kent Mulville had been up to his room, but had come back\nwith a face that told as few tales as I had seen it succeed in telling on\nthe evening I waited in the lecture-room with Miss Anvoy.  I said to\nmyself that our friend had gone out, but it was a comfort that the\npresence of a comparative stranger deprived us of the dreary duty of\nsuggesting to each other, in respect of his errand, edifying\npossibilities in which we didn\u2019t ourselves believe.  At ten o\u2019clock he\ncame into the drawing-room with his waistcoat much awry but his eyes\nsending out great signals.  It was precisely with his entrance that I\nceased to be vividly conscious of him.  I saw that the crystal, as I had\ncalled it, had begun to swing, and I had need of my immediate attention\nfor Miss Anvoy.\n\nEven when I was told afterwards that he had, as we might have said\nto-day, broken the record, the manner in which that attention had been\nrewarded relieved me of a sense of loss.  I had of course a perfect\ngeneral consciousness that something great was going on: it was a little\nlike having been etherised to hear Herr Joachim play.  The old music was\nin the air; I felt the strong pulse of thought, the sink and swell, the\nflight, the poise, the plunge; but I knew something about one of the\nlisteners that nobody else knew, and Saltram\u2019s monologue could reach me\nonly through that medium.  To this hour I\u2019m of no use when, as a witness,\nI\u2019m appealed to\u2014for they still absurdly contend about it\u2014as to whether or\nno on that historic night he was drunk; and my position is slightly\nridiculous, for I\u2019ve never cared to tell them what it really was I was\ntaken up with.  What I got out of it is the only morsel of the total\nexperience that is quite my own.  The others were shared, but this is\nincommunicable.  I feel that now, I\u2019m bound to say, even in thus roughly\nevoking the occasion, and it takes something from my pride of clearness.\nHowever, I shall perhaps be as clear as is absolutely needful if I remark\nthat our young lady was too much given up to her own intensity of\nobservation to be sensible of mine.  It was plainly not the question of\nher marriage that had brought her back.  I greatly enjoyed this discovery\nand was sure that had that question alone been involved she would have\nstirred no step.  In this case doubtless Gravener would, in spite of the\nHouse of Commons, have found means to rejoin her.  It afterwards made me\nuncomfortable for her that, alone in the lodging Mrs. Mulville had put\nbefore me as dreary, she should have in any degree the air of waiting for\nher fate; so that I was presently relieved at hearing of her having gone\nto stay at Coldfield.  If she was in England at all while the engagement\nstood the only proper place for her was under Lady Maddock\u2019s wing.  Now\nthat she was unfortunate and relatively poor, perhaps her prospective\nsister-in-law would be wholly won over.\n\nThere would be much to say, if I had space, about the way her behaviour,\nas I caught gleams of it, ministered to the image that had taken birth in\nmy mind, to my private amusement, while that other night I listened to\nGeorge Gravener in the railway-carriage.  I watched her in the light of\nthis queer possibility\u2014a formidable thing certainly to meet\u2014and I was\naware that it coloured, extravagantly perhaps, my interpretation of her\nvery looks and tones.  At Wimbledon for instance it had appeared to me\nshe was literally afraid of Saltram, in dread of a coercion that she had\nbegun already to feel.  I had come up to town with her the next day and\nhad been convinced that, though deeply interested, she was immensely on\nher guard.  She would show as little as possible before she should be\nready to show everything.  What this final exhibition might be on the\npart of a girl perceptibly so able to think things out I found it great\nsport to forecast.  It would have been exciting to be approached by her,\nappealed to by her for advice; but I prayed to heaven I mightn\u2019t find\nmyself in such a predicament.  If there was really a present rigour in\nthe situation of which Gravener had sketched for me the elements, she\nwould have to get out of her difficulty by herself.  It wasn\u2019t I who had\nlaunched her and it wasn\u2019t I who could help her.  I didn\u2019t fail to ask\nmyself why, since I couldn\u2019t help her, I should think so much about her.\nIt was in part my suspense that was responsible for this; I waited\nimpatiently to see whether she wouldn\u2019t have told Mrs. Mulville a portion\nat least of what I had learned from Gravener.  But I saw Mrs. Mulville\nwas still reduced to wonder what she had come out again for if she hadn\u2019t\ncome as a conciliatory bride.  That she had come in some other character\nwas the only thing that fitted all the appearances.  Having for family\nreasons to spend some time that spring in the west of England, I was in a\nmanner out of earshot of the great oceanic rumble\u2014I mean of the\ncontinuous hum of Saltram\u2019s thought\u2014and my uneasiness tended to keep me\nquiet.  There was something I wanted so little to have to say that my\nprudence surmounted my curiosity.  I only wondered if Ruth Anvoy talked\nover the idea of The Coxon Fund with Lady Maddock, and also somewhat why\nI didn\u2019t hear from Wimbledon.  I had a reproachful note about something\nor other from Mrs. Saltram, but it contained no mention of Lady Coxon\u2019s\nniece, on whom her eyes had been much less fixed since the recent\nuntoward events.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nPOOR Adelaide\u2019s silence was fully explained later\u2014practically explained\nwhen in June, returning to London, I was honoured by this admirable woman\nwith an early visit.  As soon as she arrived I guessed everything, and as\nsoon as she told me that darling Ruth had been in her house nearly a\nmonth I had my question ready.  \u201cWhat in the name of maidenly modesty is\nshe staying in England for?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause she loves me so!\u201d cried Adelaide gaily.  But she hadn\u2019t come to\nsee me only to tell me Miss Anvoy loved her: that was quite sufficiently\nestablished, and what was much more to the point was that Mr. Gravener\nhad now raised an objection to it.  He had protested at least against her\nbeing at Wimbledon, where in the innocence of his heart he had originally\nbrought her himself; he called on her to put an end to their engagement\nin the only proper, the only happy manner.\n\n\u201cAnd why in the world doesn\u2019t she do do?\u201d I asked.\n\nAdelaide had a pause.  \u201cShe says you know.\u201d\n\nThen on my also hesitating she added: \u201cA condition he makes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Coxon Fund?\u201d I panted.\n\n\u201cHe has mentioned to her his having told you about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh but so little!  Do you mean she has accepted the trust?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the most splendid spirit\u2014as a duty about which there can be no two\nopinions.\u201d  To which my friend added: \u201cOf course she\u2019s thinking of Mr.\nSaltram.\u201d\n\nI gave a quick cry at this, which, in its violence, made my visitor turn\npale.  \u201cHow very awful!\u201d\n\n\u201cAwful?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, to have anything to do with such an idea one\u2019s self.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure _you_ needn\u2019t!\u201d and Mrs. Mulville tossed her head.\n\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t good enough!\u201d I went on; to which she opposed a sound almost as\ncontentious as my own had been.  This made me, with genuine immediate\nhorror, exclaim: \u201cYou haven\u2019t influenced her, I hope!\u201d and my emphasis\nbrought back the blood with a rush to poor Adelaide\u2019s face.  She declared\nwhile she blushed\u2014for I had frightened her again\u2014that she had never\ninfluenced anybody and that the girl had only seen and heard and judged\nfor herself.  _He_ had influenced her, if I would, as he did every one\nwho had a soul: that word, as we knew, even expressed feebly the power of\nthe things he said to haunt the mind.  How could she, Adelaide, help it\nif Miss Anvoy\u2019s mind was haunted?  I demanded with a groan what right a\npretty girl engaged to a rising M.P. had to _have_ a mind; but the only\nexplanation my bewildered friend could give me was that she was so\nclever.  She regarded Mr. Saltram naturally as a tremendous force for\ngood.  She was intelligent enough to understand him and generous enough\nto admire.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s many things enough, but is she, among them, rich enough?\u201d I\ndemanded.  \u201cRich enough, I mean, to sacrifice such a lot of good money?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for herself to judge.  Besides, it\u2019s not her own money; she\ndoesn\u2019t in the least consider it so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Gravener does, if not _his_ own; and that\u2019s the whole difficulty?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe difficulty that brought her back, yes: she had absolutely to see her\npoor aunt\u2019s solicitor.  It\u2019s clear that by Lady Coxon\u2019s will she may have\nthe money, but it\u2019s still clearer to her conscience that the original\ncondition, definite, intensely implied on her uncle\u2019s part, is attached\nto the use of it.  She can only take one view of it.  It\u2019s for the\nEndowment or it\u2019s for nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Endowment,\u201d I permitted myself to observe, \u201cis a conception\nsuperficially sublime, but fundamentally ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you repeating Mr. Gravener\u2019s words?\u201d Adelaide asked.\n\n\u201cPossibly, though I\u2019ve not seen him for months.  It\u2019s simply the way it\nstrikes me too.  It\u2019s an old wife\u2019s tale.  Gravener made some reference\nto the legal aspect, but such an absurdly loose arrangement has _no_\nlegal aspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuth doesn\u2019t insist on that,\u201d said Mrs. Mulville; \u201cand it\u2019s, for her,\nexactly this technical weakness that constitutes the force of the moral\nobligation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you repeating _her_ words?\u201d I enquired.  I forget what else Adelaide\nsaid, but she said she was magnificent.  I thought of George Gravener\nconfronted with such magnificence as that, and I asked what could have\nmade two such persons ever suppose they understood each other.  Mrs.\nMulville assured me the girl loved him as such a woman could love and\nthat she suffered as such a woman could suffer.  Nevertheless she wanted\nto see _me_.  At this I sprang up with a groan.  \u201cOh I\u2019m so sorry!\u2014when?\u201d\nSmall though her sense of humour, I think Adelaide laughed at my\nsequence.  We discussed the day, the nearest it would be convenient I\nshould come out; but before she went I asked my visitor how long she had\nbeen acquainted with these prodigies.\n\n\u201cFor several weeks, but I was pledged to secrecy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t write?\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t very well tell you she was with me without telling you that\nno time had even yet been fixed for her marriage.  And I couldn\u2019t very\nwell tell you as much as that without telling you what I knew of the\nreason of it.  It was not till a day or two ago,\u201d Mrs. Mulville went on,\n\u201cthat she asked me to ask you if you wouldn\u2019t come and see her.  Then at\nlast she spoke of your knowing about the idea of the Endowment.\u201d\n\nI turned this over.  \u201cWhy on earth does she want to see me?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo talk with you, naturally, about Mr. Saltram.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a subject for the prize?\u201d  This was hugely obvious, and I presently\nreturned: \u201cI think I\u2019ll sail to-morrow for Australia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then\u2014sail!\u201d said Mrs. Mulville, getting up.\n\nBut I frivolously, continued.  \u201cOn Thursday at five, we said?\u201d  The\nappointment was made definite and I enquired how, all this time, the\nunconscious candidate had carried himself.\n\n\u201cIn perfection, really, by the happiest of chances: he has positively\nbeen a dear.  And then, as to what we revere him for, in the most\nwonderful form.  His very highest\u2014pure celestial light.  You _won\u2019t_ do\nhim an ill turn?\u201d Adelaide pleaded at the door.\n\n\u201cWhat danger can equal for him the danger to which he\u2019s exposed from\nhimself?\u201d I asked.  \u201cLook out sharp, if he has lately been too prim.\nHe\u2019ll presently take a day off, treat us to some exhibition that will\nmake an Endowment a scandal.\u201d\n\n\u201cA scandal?\u201d Mrs. Mulville dolorously echoed.\n\n\u201cIs Miss Anvoy prepared for that?\u201d\n\nMy visitor, for a moment, screwed her parasol into my carpet.  \u201cHe grows\nbigger every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo do you!\u201d I laughed as she went off.\n\nThat girl at Wimbledon, on the Thursday afternoon, more than justified my\napprehensions.  I recognised fully now the cause of the agitation she had\nproduced in me from the first\u2014the faint foreknowledge that there was\nsomething very stiff I should have to do for her.  I felt more than ever\ncommitted to my fate as, standing before her in the big drawing-room\nwhere they had tactfully left us to ourselves, I tried with a smile to\nstring together the pearls of lucidity which, from her chair, she\nsuccessively tossed me.  Pale and bright, in her monotonous mourning, she\nwas an image of intelligent purpose, of the passion of duty; but I asked\nmyself whether any girl had ever had so charming an instinct as that\nwhich permitted her to laugh out, as for the joy of her difficulty, into\nthe priggish old room.  This remarkable young woman could be earnest\nwithout being solemn, and at moments when I ought doubtless to have\ncursed her obstinacy I found myself watching the unstudied play of her\neyebrows or the recurrence of a singularly intense whiteness produced by\nthe parting of her lips.  These aberrations, I hasten to add, didn\u2019t\nprevent my learning soon enough why she had wished to see me.  Her reason\nfor this was as distinct as her beauty: it was to make me explain what I\nhad meant, on the occasion of our first meeting, by Mr. Saltram\u2019s want of\ndignity.  It wasn\u2019t that she couldn\u2019t imagine, but she desired it there\nfrom my lips.  What she really desired of course was to know whether\nthere was worse about him than what she had found out for herself.  She\nhadn\u2019t been a month so much in the house with him without discovering\nthat he wasn\u2019t a man of monumental bronze.  He was like a jelly minus its\nmould, he had to be embanked; and that was precisely the source of her\ninterest in him and the ground of her project.  She put her project\nboldly before me: there it stood in its preposterous beauty.  She was as\nwilling to take the humorous view of it as I could be: the only\ndifference was that for her the humorous view of a thing wasn\u2019t\nnecessarily prohibitive, wasn\u2019t paralysing.\n\nMoreover she professed that she couldn\u2019t discuss with me the primary\nquestion\u2014the moral obligation: that was in her own breast.  There were\nthings she couldn\u2019t go into\u2014injunctions, impressions she had received.\nThey were a part of the closest intimacy of her intercourse with her\naunt, they were absolutely clear to her; and on questions of delicacy,\nthe interpretation of a fidelity, of a promise, one had always in the\nlast resort to make up one\u2019s mind for one\u2019s self.  It was the idea of the\napplication to the particular case, such a splendid one at last, that\ntroubled her, and she admitted that it stirred very deep things.  She\ndidn\u2019t pretend that such a responsibility was a simple matter; if it\n_had_ been she wouldn\u2019t have attempted to saddle me with any portion of\nit.  The Mulvilles were sympathy itself, but were they absolutely candid?\nCould they indeed be, in their position\u2014would it even have been to be\ndesired?  Yes, she had sent for me to ask no less than that of me\u2014whether\nthere was anything dreadful kept back.  She made no allusion whatever to\nGeorge Gravener\u2014I thought her silence the only good taste and her gaiety\nperhaps a part of the very anxiety of that discretion, the effect of a\ndetermination that people shouldn\u2019t know from herself that her relations\nwith the man she was to marry were strained.  All the weight, however,\nthat she left me to throw was a sufficient implication of the weight _he_\nhad thrown in vain.  Oh she knew the question of character was immense,\nand that one couldn\u2019t entertain any plan for making merit comfortable\nwithout running the gauntlet of that terrible procession of\ninterrogation-points which, like a young ladies\u2019 school out for a walk,\nhooked their uniform noses at the tail of governess Conduct.  But were we\nabsolutely to hold that there was never, never, never an exception,\nnever, never, never an occasion for liberal acceptance, for clever\ncharity, for suspended pedantry\u2014for letting one side, in short,\noutbalance another?  When Miss Anvoy threw off this appeal I could have\nembraced her for so delightfully emphasising her unlikeness to Mrs.\nSaltram.  \u201cWhy not have the courage of one\u2019s forgiveness,\u201d she asked, \u201cas\nwell as the enthusiasm of one\u2019s adhesion?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeeing how wonderfully you\u2019ve threshed the whole thing out,\u201d I evasively\nreplied, \u201cgives me an extraordinary notion of the point your enthusiasm\nhas reached.\u201d\n\nShe considered this remark an instant with her eyes on mine, and I\ndivined that it struck her I might possibly intend it as a reference to\nsome personal subjection to our fat philosopher, to some aberration of\nsensibility, some perversion of taste.  At least I couldn\u2019t interpret\notherwise the sudden flash that came into her face.  Such a\nmanifestation, as the result of any word of mine, embarrassed me; but\nwhile I was thinking how to reassure her the flush passed away in a smile\nof exquisite good nature.  \u201cOh you see one forgets so wonderfully how one\ndislikes him!\u201d she said; and if her tone simply extinguished his strange\nfigure with the brush of its compassion, it also rings in my ear to-day\nas the purest of all our praises.  But with what quick response of fine\npity such a relegation of the man himself made me privately sigh \u201cAh poor\nSaltram!\u201d  She instantly, with this, took the measure of all I didn\u2019t\nbelieve, and it enabled her to go on: \u201cWhat can one do when a person has\ngiven such a lift to one\u2019s interest in life?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, what can one do?\u201d  If I struck her as a little vague it was because\nI was thinking of another person.  I indulged in another inarticulate\nmurmur\u2014\u201cPoor George Gravener!\u201d  What had become of the lift _he_ had\ngiven that interest?  Later on I made up my mind that she was sore and\nstricken at the appearance he presented of wanting the miserable money.\nThis was the hidden reason of her alienation.  The probable sincerity, in\nspite of the illiberality, of his scruples about the particular use of it\nunder discussion didn\u2019t efface the ugliness of his demand that they\nshould buy a good house with it.  Then, as for _his_ alienation, he\ndidn\u2019t, pardonably enough, grasp the lift Frank Saltram had given her\ninterest in life.  If a mere spectator could ask that last question, with\nwhat rage in his heart the man himself might!  He wasn\u2019t, like her, I was\nto see, too proud to show me why he was disappointed.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nI WAS unable this time to stay to dinner: such at any rate was the plea\non which I took leave.  I desired in truth to get away from my young\nlady, for that obviously helped me not to pretend to satisfy her.  How\n_could_ I satisfy her?  I asked myself\u2014how could I tell her how much had\nbeen kept back?  I didn\u2019t even know and I certainly didn\u2019t desire to\nknow.  My own policy had ever been to learn the least about poor\nSaltram\u2019s weaknesses\u2014not to learn the most.  A great deal that I had in\nfact learned had been forced upon me by his wife.  There was something\neven irritating in Miss Anvoy\u2019s crude conscientiousness, and I wondered\nwhy, after all, she couldn\u2019t have let him alone and been content to\nentrust George Gravener with the purchase of the good house.  I was sure\nhe would have driven a bargain, got something excellent and cheap.  I\nlaughed louder even than she, I temporised, I failed her; I told her I\nmust think over her case.  I professed a horror of responsibilities and\ntwitted her with her own extravagant passion for them.  It wasn\u2019t really\nthat I was afraid of the scandal, the moral discredit for the Fund; what\ntroubled me most was a feeling of a different order.  Of course, as the\nbeneficiary of the Fund was to enjoy a simple life-interest, as it was\nhoped that new beneficiaries would arise and come up to new standards, it\nwouldn\u2019t be a trifle that the first of these worthies shouldn\u2019t have been\na striking example of the domestic virtues.  The Fund would start badly,\nas it were, and the laurel would, in some respects at least, scarcely be\ngreener from the brows of the original wearer.  That idea, however, was\nat that hour, as I have hinted, not the source of solicitude it ought\nperhaps to have been, for I felt less the irregularity of Saltram\u2019s\ngetting the money than that of this exalted young woman\u2019s giving it up.\nI wanted her to have it for herself, and I told her so before I went\naway.  She looked graver at this than she had looked at all, saying she\nhoped such a preference wouldn\u2019t make me dishonest.\n\nIt made me, to begin with, very restless\u2014made me, instead of going\nstraight to the station, fidget a little about that many-coloured Common\nwhich gives Wimbledon horizons.  There was a worry for me to work off, or\nrather keep at a distance, for I declined even to admit to myself that I\nhad, in Miss Anvoy\u2019s phrase, been saddled with it.  What could have been\nclearer indeed than the attitude of recognising perfectly what a world of\ntrouble The Coxon Fund would in future save us, and of yet liking better\nto face a continuance of that trouble than see, and in fact contribute\nto, a deviation from attainable bliss in the life of two other persons in\nwhom I was deeply interested?  Suddenly, at the end of twenty minutes,\nthere was projected across this clearness the image of a massive\nmiddle-aged man seated on a bench under a tree, with sad far-wandering\neyes and plump white hands folded on the head of a stick\u2014a stick I\nrecognised, a stout gold-headed staff that I had given him in devoted\ndays.  I stopped short as he turned his face to me, and it happened that\nfor some reason or other I took in as I had perhaps never done before the\nbeauty of his rich blank gaze.  It was charged with experience as the sky\nis charged with light, and I felt on the instant as if we had been\noverspanned and conjoined by the great arch of a bridge or the great dome\nof a temple.  Doubtless I was rendered peculiarly sensitive to it by\nsomething in the way I had been giving him up and sinking him.  While I\nmet it I stood there smitten, and I felt myself responding to it with a\nsort of guilty grimace.  This brought back his attention in a smile which\nexpressed for me a cheerful weary patience, a bruised noble gentleness.\nI had told Miss Anvoy that he had no dignity, but what did he seem to me,\nall unbuttoned and fatigued as he waited for me to come up, if he didn\u2019t\nseem unconcerned with small things, didn\u2019t seem in short majestic?  There\nwas majesty in his mere unconsciousness of our little conferences and\npuzzlements over his maintenance and his reward.\n\nAfter I had sat by him a few minutes I passed my arm over his big soft\nshoulder\u2014wherever you touched him you found equally little firmness\u2014and\nsaid in a tone of which the suppliance fell oddly on my own ear: \u201cCome\nback to town with me, old friend\u2014come back and spend the evening.\u201d  I\nwanted to hold him, I wanted to keep him, and at Waterloo, an hour later,\nI telegraphed possessively to the Mulvilles.  When he objected, as\nregards staying all night, that he had no things, I asked him if he\nhadn\u2019t everything of mine.  I had abstained from ordering dinner, and it\nwas too late for preliminaries at a club; so we were reduced to tea and\nfried fish at my rooms\u2014reduced also to the transcendent.  Something had\ncome up which made me want him to feel at peace with me\u2014and which,\nprecisely, was all the dear man himself wanted on any occasion.  I had\ntoo often had to press upon him considerations irrelevant, but it gives\nme pleasure now to think that on that particular evening I didn\u2019t even\nmention Mrs. Saltram and the children.  Late into the night we smoked and\ntalked; old shames and old rigours fell away from us; I only let him see\nthat I was conscious of what I owed him.  He was as mild as contrition\nand as copious as faith; he was never so fine as on a shy return, and\neven better at forgiving than at being forgiven.  I dare say it was a\nsmaller matter than that famous night at Wimbledon, the night of the\nproblematical sobriety and of Miss Anvoy\u2019s initiation; but I was as much\nin it on this occasion as I had been out of it then.  At about 1.30 he\nwas sublime.\n\nHe never, in whatever situation, rose till all other risings were over,\nand his breakfasts, at Wimbledon, had always been the principal reason\nmentioned by departing cooks.  The coast was therefore clear for me to\nreceive her when, early the next morning, to my surprise, it was\nannounced to me his wife had called.  I hesitated, after she had come up,\nabout telling her Saltram was in the house, but she herself settled the\nquestion, kept me reticent by drawing forth a sealed letter which,\nlooking at me very hard in the eyes, she placed, with a pregnant absence\nof comment, in my hand.  For a single moment there glimmered before me\nthe fond hope that Mrs. Saltram had tendered me, as it were, her\nresignation and desired to embody the act in an unsparing form.  To bring\nthis about I would have feigned any humiliation; but after my eyes had\ncaught the superscription I heard myself say with a flatness that\nbetrayed a sense of something very different from relief: \u201cOh the\nPudneys!\u201d  I knew their envelopes though they didn\u2019t know mine.  They\nalways used the kind sold at post-offices with the stamp affixed, and as\nthis letter hadn\u2019t been posted they had wasted a penny on me.  I had seen\ntheir horrid missives to the Mulvilles, but hadn\u2019t been in direct\ncorrespondence with them.\n\n\u201cThey enclosed it to me, to be delivered.  They doubtless explain to you\nthat they hadn\u2019t your address.\u201d\n\nI turned the thing over without opening it.  \u201cWhy in the world should\nthey write to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause they\u2019ve something to tell you.  The worst,\u201d Mrs. Saltram dryly\nadded.\n\nIt was another chapter, I felt, of the history of their lamentable\nquarrel with her husband, the episode in which, vindictively,\ndisingenuously as they themselves had behaved, one had to admit that he\nhad put himself more grossly in the wrong than at any moment of his life.\nHe had begun by insulting the matchless Mulvilles for these more specious\nprotectors, and then, according to his wont at the end of a few months,\nhad dug a still deeper ditch for his aberration than the chasm left\nyawning behind.  The chasm at Wimbledon was now blessedly closed; but the\nPudneys, across their persistent gulf, kept up the nastiest fire.  I\nnever doubted they had a strong case, and I had been from the first for\nnot defending him\u2014reasoning that if they weren\u2019t contradicted they\u2019d\nperhaps subside.  This was above all what I wanted, and I so far\nprevailed that I did arrest the correspondence in time to save our little\ncircle an infliction heavier than it perhaps would have borne.  I knew,\nthat is I divined, that their allegations had gone as yet only as far as\ntheir courage, conscious as they were in their own virtue of an exposed\nplace in which Saltram could have planted a blow.  It was a question with\nthem whether a man who had himself so much to cover up would dare his\nblow; so that these vessels of rancour were in a manner afraid of each\nother.  I judged that on the day the Pudneys should cease for some reason\nor other to be afraid they would treat us to some revelation more\ndisconcerting than any of its predecessors.  As I held Mrs. Saltram\u2019s\nletter in my hand it was distinctly communicated to me that the day had\ncome\u2014they had ceased to be afraid.  \u201cI don\u2019t want to know the worst,\u201d I\npresently declared.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to open the letter.  It also contains an enclosure.\u201d\n\nI felt it\u2014it was fat and uncanny.  \u201cWheels within wheels!\u201d I exclaimed.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something for me too to deliver.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo they tell me\u2014to Miss Anvoy.\u201d\n\nI stared; I felt a certain thrill.  \u201cWhy don\u2019t they send it to her\ndirectly?\u201d\n\nMrs. Saltram hung fire.  \u201cBecause she\u2019s staying with Mr. and Mrs.\nMulville.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why should that prevent?\u201d\n\nAgain my visitor faltered, and I began to reflect on the grotesque, the\nunconscious perversity of her action.  I was the only person save George\nGravener and the Mulvilles who was aware of Sir Gregory Coxon\u2019s and of\nMiss Anvoy\u2019s strange bounty.  Where could there have been a more signal\nillustration of the clumsiness of human affairs than her having\ncomplacently selected this moment to fly in the face of it?  \u201cThere\u2019s the\nchance of their seeing her letters.  They know Mr. Pudney\u2019s hand.\u201d\n\nStill I didn\u2019t understand; then it flashed upon me.  \u201cYou mean they might\nintercept it?  How can you imply anything so base?\u201d I indignantly\ndemanded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not I\u2014it\u2019s Mr. Pudney!\u201d cried Mrs. Saltram with a flush.  \u201cIt\u2019s his\nown idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why couldn\u2019t he send the letter to you to be delivered?\u201d\n\nMrs. Saltram\u2019s embarrassment increased; she gave me another hard look.\n\u201cYou must make that out for yourself.\u201d\n\nI made it out quickly enough.  \u201cIt\u2019s a denunciation?\u201d\n\n\u201cA real lady doesn\u2019t betray her husband!\u201d this virtuous woman exclaimed.\n\nI burst out laughing, and I fear my laugh may have had an effect of\nimpertinence.  \u201cEspecially to Miss Anvoy, who\u2019s so easily shocked? Why do\nsuch things concern _her_?\u201d I asked, much at a loss.\n\n\u201cBecause she\u2019s there, exposed to all his craft.  Mr. and Mrs. Pudney have\nbeen watching this: they feel she may be taken in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for all the rest of us!  What difference can it make when she\nhas lost her power to contribute?\u201d\n\nAgain Mrs. Saltram considered; then very nobly: \u201cThere are other things\nin the world than money.\u201d  This hadn\u2019t occurred to her so long as the\nyoung lady had any; but she now added, with a glance at my letter, that\nMr. and Mrs. Pudney doubtless explained their motives.  \u201cIt\u2019s all in\nkindness,\u201d she continued as she got up.\n\n\u201cKindness to Miss Anvoy?  You took, on the whole, another view of\nkindness before her reverses.\u201d\n\nMy companion smiled with some acidity \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re no safer than the\nMulvilles!\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t want her to think that, nor that she should report to the\nPudneys that they had not been happy in their agent; and I well remember\nthat this was the moment at which I began, with considerable emotion, to\npromise myself to enjoin upon Miss Anvoy never to open any letter that\nshould come to her in one of those penny envelopes.  My emotion, and I\nfear I must add my confusion, quickly deepened; I presently should have\nbeen as glad to frighten Mrs. Saltram as to think I might by some\ndiplomacy restore the Pudneys to a quieter vigilance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s best you should take _my_ view of my safety,\u201d I at any rate soon\nresponded.  When I saw she didn\u2019t know what I meant by this I added: \u201cYou\nmay turn out to have done, in bringing me this letter, a thing you\u2019ll\nprofoundly regret.\u201d  My tone had a significance which, I could see, did\nmake her uneasy, and there was a moment, after I had made two or three\nmore remarks of studiously bewildering effect, at which her eyes followed\nso hungrily the little flourish of the letter with which I emphasised\nthem that I instinctively slipped Mr. Pudney\u2019s communication into my\npocket.  She looked, in her embarrassed annoyance, capable of grabbing it\nto send it back to him.  I felt, after she had gone, as if I had almost\ngiven her my word I wouldn\u2019t deliver the enclosure.  The passionate\nmovement, at any rate, with which, in solitude, I transferred the whole\nthing, unopened, from my pocket to a drawer which I double-locked would\nhave amounted, for an initiated observer, to some such pledge.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM left me drawing my breath more quickly and indeed almost in\npain\u2014as if I had just perilously grazed the loss of something precious.\nI didn\u2019t quite know what it was\u2014it had a shocking resemblance to my\nhonour.  The emotion was the livelier surely in that my pulses even yet\nvibrated to the pleasure with which, the night before, I had rallied to\nthe rare analyst, the great intellectual adventurer and pathfinder.  What\nhad dropped from me like a cumbersome garment as Saltram appeared before\nme in the afternoon on the heath was the disposition to haggle over his\nvalue.  Hang it, one had to choose, one had to put that value somewhere;\nso I would put it really high and have done with it.  Mrs. Mulville drove\nin for him at a discreet hour\u2014the earliest she could suppose him to have\ngot up; and I learned that Miss Anvoy would also have come had she not\nbeen expecting a visit from Mr. Gravener.  I was perfectly mindful that I\nwas under bonds to see this young lady, and also that I had a letter to\nhand to her; but I took my time, I waited from day to day.  I left Mrs.\nSaltram to deal as her apprehensions should prompt with the Pudneys.  I\nknew at last what I meant\u2014I had ceased to wince at my responsibility.  I\ngave this supreme impression of Saltram time to fade if it would; but it\ndidn\u2019t fade, and, individually, it hasn\u2019t faded even now.  During the\nmonth that I thus invited myself to stiffen again, Adelaide Mulville,\nperplexed by my absence, wrote to me to ask why I _was_ so stiff.  At\nthat season of the year I was usually oftener \u201cwith\u201d them.  She also\nwrote that she feared a real estrangement had set in between Mr. Gravener\nand her sweet young friend\u2014a state of things but half satisfactory to her\nso long as the advantage resulting to Mr. Saltram failed to disengage\nitself from the merely nebulous state.  She intimated that her sweet\nyoung friend was, if anything, a trifle too reserved; she also intimated\nthat there might now be an opening for another clever young man.  There\nnever was the slightest opening, I may here parenthesise, and of course\nthe question can\u2019t come up to-day.  These are old frustrations now.  Ruth\nAnvoy hasn\u2019t married, I hear, and neither have I.  During the month,\ntoward the end, I wrote to George Gravener to ask if, on a special\nerrand, I might come to see him, and his answer was to knock the very\nnext day at my door.  I saw he had immediately connected my enquiry with\nthe talk we had had in the railway-carriage, and his promptitude showed\nthat the ashes of his eagerness weren\u2019t yet cold.  I told him there was\nsomething I felt I ought in candour to let him know\u2014I recognised the\nobligation his friendly confidence had laid on me.\n\n\u201cYou mean Miss Anvoy has talked to you?  She has told me so herself,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t to tell you so that I wanted to see you,\u201d I replied; \u201cfor it\nseemed to me that such a communication would rest wholly with herself.\nIf however she did speak to you of our conversation she probably told you\nI was discouraging.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiscouraging?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the subject of a present application of The Coxon Fund.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the case of Mr. Saltram?  My dear fellow, I don\u2019t know what you call\ndiscouraging!\u201d Gravener cried.\n\n\u201cWell I thought I was, and I thought she thought I was.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe she did, but such a thing\u2019s measured by the effect.  She\u2019s not\n\u2018discouraged,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s her own affair.  The reason I asked you to see me was that it\nappeared to me I ought to tell you frankly that\u2014decidedly!\u2014I can\u2019t\nundertake to produce that effect.  In fact I don\u2019t want to!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good of you, damn you!\u201d my visitor laughed, red and really\ngrave.  Then he said: \u201cYou\u2019d like to see that scoundrel publicly\nglorified\u2014perched on the pedestal of a great complimentary pension?\u201d\n\nI braced myself.  \u201cTaking one form of public recognition with another it\nseems to me on the whole I should be able to bear it.  When I see the\ncompliments that _are_ paid right and left I ask myself why this one\nshouldn\u2019t take its course.  This therefore is what you\u2019re entitled to\nhave looked to me to mention to you.  I\u2019ve some evidence that perhaps\nwould be really dissuasive, but I propose to invite Mss Anvoy to remain\nin ignorance of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd to invite me to do the same?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh you don\u2019t require it\u2014you\u2019ve evidence enough.  I speak of a sealed\nletter that I\u2019ve been requested to deliver to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t mean to?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one consideration that would make me,\u201d I said.\n\nGravener\u2019s clear handsome eyes plunged into mine a minute, but evidently\nwithout fishing up a clue to this motive\u2014a failure by which I was almost\nwounded.  \u201cWhat does the letter contain?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sealed, as I tell you, and I don\u2019t know what it contains.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is it sent through you?\u201d\n\n\u201cRather than you?\u201d I wondered how to put the thing.  \u201cThe only\nexplanation I can think of is that the person sending it may have\nimagined your relations with Miss Anvoy to be at an end\u2014may have been\ntold this is the case by Mrs. Saltram.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy relations with Miss Anvoy are not at an end,\u201d poor Gravener\nstammered.\n\nAgain for an instant I thought.  \u201cThe offer I propose to make you gives\nme the right to address you a question remarkably direct.  Are you still\nengaged to Miss Anvoy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d he slowly brought out.  \u201cBut we\u2019re perfectly good\nfriends.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch good friends that you\u2019ll again become prospective husband and wife\nif the obstacle in your path be removed?\u201d\n\n\u201cRemoved?\u201d he anxiously repeated.\n\n\u201cIf I send Miss Anvoy the letter I speak of she may give up her idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen for God\u2019s sake send it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do so if you\u2019re ready to assure me that her sacrifice would now\npresumably bring about your marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d marry her the next day!\u201d my visitor cried.\n\n\u201cYes, but would she marry _you_?  What I ask of you of course is nothing\nless than your word of honour as to your conviction of this.  If you give\nit me,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll engage to hand her the letter before night.\u201d\n\nGravener took up his hat; turning it mechanically round he stood looking\na moment hard at its unruffled perfection.  Then very angrily honestly\nand gallantly, \u201cHand it to the devil!\u201d he broke out; with which he\nclapped the hat on his head and left me.\n\n\u201cWill you read it or not?\u201d I said to Ruth Anvoy, at Wimbledon, when I had\ntold her the story of Mrs. Saltram\u2019s visit.\n\nShe debated for a time probably of the briefest, but long enough to make\nme nervous.  \u201cHave you brought it with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo indeed.  It\u2019s at home, locked up.\u201d\n\nThere was another great silence, and then she said \u201cGo back and destroy\nit.\u201d\n\nI went back, but I didn\u2019t destroy it till after Saltram\u2019s death, when I\nburnt it unread.  The Pudneys approached her again pressingly, but,\nprompt as they were, The Coxon Fund had already become an operative\nbenefit and a general amaze: Mr. Saltram, while we gathered about, as it\nwere, to watch the manna descend, had begun to draw the magnificent\nincome.  He drew it as he had always drawn everything, with a grand\nabstracted gesture.  Its magnificence, alas, as all the world now knows,\nquite quenched him; it was the beginning of his decline.  It was also\nnaturally a new grievance for his wife, who began to believe in him as\nsoon as he was blighted, and who at this hour accuses us of having bribed\nhim, on the whim of a meddlesome American, to renounce his glorious\noffice, to become, as she says, like everybody else.  The very day he\nfound himself able to publish he wholly ceased to produce.  This deprived\nus, as may easily be imagined, of much of our occupation, and especially\ndeprived the Mulvilles, whose want of self-support I never measured till\nthey lost their great inmate.  They\u2019ve no one to live on now.  Adelaide\u2019s\nmost frequent reference to their destitution is embodied in the remark\nthat dear far-away Ruth\u2019s intentions were doubtless good.  She and Kent\nare even yet looking for another prop, but no one presents a true sphere\nof usefulness.  They complain that people are self-sufficing.  With\nSaltram the fine type of the child of adoption was scattered, the\ngrander, the elder style.  They\u2019ve got their carriage back, but what\u2019s an\nempty carriage?  In short I think we were all happier as well as poorer\nbefore; even including George Gravener, who by the deaths of his brother\nand his nephew has lately become Lord Maddock.  His wife, whose fortune\nclears the property, is criminally dull; he hates being in the Upper\nHouse, and hasn\u2019t yet had high office.  But what are these accidents,\nwhich I should perhaps apologise for mentioning, in the light of the\ngreat eventual boon promised the patient by the rate at which The Coxon\nFund must be rolling up?",
    "E-text prepared by Jonathan Ingram, Janet Blenkinship, and the Project\nGutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading Team (https://www.pgdp.net/)\n\n\n\nTranscriber's note: The author is Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797).\n\n\n\n\n\nMARY,\n\nA Fiction\n\nL'exercice des plus sublimes vertus \u00e9leve et nourrit le g\u00e9nie.\n                                                     ROUSSEAU.\n\nLondon,\nPrinted for J. Johnson, St. Paul's Church-Yard.\n\nMDCCLXXXVIII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT.\n\n\nIn delineating the Heroine of this Fiction, the Author attempts to\ndevelop a character different from those generally portrayed. This woman\nis neither a Clarissa, a Lady G----, nor a[A] Sophie.--It would be vain\nto mention the various modifications of these models, as it would to\nremark, how widely artists wander from nature, when they copy the\noriginals of great masters. They catch the gross parts; but the subtile\nspirit evaporates; and not having the just ties, affectation disgusts,\nwhen grace was expected to charm.\n\nThose compositions only have power to delight, and carry us willing\ncaptives, where the soul of the author is exhibited, and animates the\nhidden springs. Lost in a pleasing enthusiasm, they live in the scenes\nthey represent; and do not measure their steps in a beaten track,\nsolicitous to gather expected flowers, and bind them in a wreath,\naccording to the prescribed rules of art.\n\nThese chosen few, wish to speak for themselves, and not to be an\necho--even of the sweetest sounds--or the reflector of the most sublime\nbeams. The[B] paradise they ramble in, must be of their own creating--or\nthe prospect soon grows insipid, and not varied by a vivifying\nprinciple, fades and dies.\n\nIn an artless tale, without episodes, the mind of a woman, who has\nthinking powers is displayed. The female organs have been thought too\nweak for this arduous employment; and experience seems to justify the\nassertion. Without arguing physically about _possibilities_--in a\nfiction, such a being may be allowed to exist; whose grandeur is derived\nfrom the operations of its own faculties, not subjugated to opinion; but\ndrawn by the individual from the original source.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote A: Rousseau.]\n\n[Footnote B: I here give the Reviewers an opportunity of being very\nwitty about the Paradise of Fools, &c.]\n\n\n\n\nMARY\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. I.\n\n\nMary, the heroine of this fiction, was the daughter of Edward, who\nmarried Eliza, a gentle, fashionable girl, with a kind of indolence in\nher temper, which might be termed negative good-nature: her virtues,\nindeed, were all of that stamp. She carefully attended to the _shews_ of\nthings, and her opinions, I should have said prejudices, were such as\nthe generality approved of. She was educated with the expectation of a\nlarge fortune, of course became a mere machine: the homage of her\nattendants made a great part of her puerile amusements, and she never\nimagined there were any relative duties for her to fulfil: notions of\nher own consequence, by these means, were interwoven in her mind, and\nthe years of youth spent in acquiring a few superficial accomplishments,\nwithout having any taste for them. When she was first introduced into\nthe polite circle, she danced with an officer, whom she faintly wished\nto be united to; but her father soon after recommending another in a\nmore distinguished rank of life, she readily submitted to his will, and\npromised to love, honour, and obey, (a vicious fool,) as in duty bound.\n\nWhile they resided in London, they lived in the usual fashionable style,\nand seldom saw each other; nor were they much more sociable when they\nwooed rural felicity for more than half the year, in a delightful\ncountry, where Nature, with lavish hand, had scattered beauties around;\nfor the master, with brute, unconscious gaze, passed them by unobserved,\nand sought amusement in country sports. He hunted in the morning, and\nafter eating an immoderate dinner, generally fell asleep: this\nseasonable rest enabled him to digest the cumbrous load; he would then\nvisit some of his pretty tenants; and when he compared their ruddy glow\nof health with his wife's countenance, which even rouge could not\nenliven, it is not necessary to say which a _gourmand_ would give the\npreference to. Their vulgar dance of spirits were infinitely more\nagreeable to his fancy than her sickly, die-away languor. Her voice was\nbut the shadow of a sound, and she had, to complete her delicacy, so\nrelaxed her nerves, that she became a mere nothing.\n\nMany such noughts are there in the female world! yet she had a good\nopinion of her own merit,--truly, she said long prayers,--and sometimes\nread her Week's Preparation: she dreaded that horrid place vulgarly\ncalled _hell_, the regions below; but whether her's was a mounting\nspirit, I cannot pretend to determine; or what sort of a planet would\nhave been proper for her, when she left her _material_ part in this\nworld, let metaphysicians settle; I have nothing to say to her unclothed\nspirit.\n\nAs she was sometimes obliged to be alone, or only with her French\nwaiting-maid, she sent to the metropolis for all the new publications,\nand while she was dressing her hair, and she could turn her eyes from\nthe glass, she ran over those most delightful substitutes for bodily\ndissipation, novels. I say bodily, or the animal soul, for a rational\none can find no employment in polite circles. The glare of lights, the\nstudied inelegancies of dress, and the compliments offered up at the\nshrine of false beauty, are all equally addressed to the senses.\n\nWhen she could not any longer indulge the caprices of fancy one way, she\ntried another. The Platonic Marriage, Eliza Warwick, and some other\ninteresting tales were perused with eagerness. Nothing could be more\nnatural than the developement of the passions, nor more striking than\nthe views of the human heart. What delicate struggles! and uncommonly\npretty turns of thought! The picture that was found on a bramble-bush,\nthe new sensitive-plant, or tree, which caught the swain by the\nupper-garment, and presented to his ravished eyes a portrait.--Fatal\nimage!--It planted a thorn in a till then insensible heart, and sent a\nnew kind of a knight-errant into the world. But even this was nothing to\nthe catastrophe, and the circumstance on which it hung, the hornet\nsettling on the sleeping lover's face. What a _heart-rending_ accident!\nShe planted, in imitation of those susceptible souls, a rose bush; but\nthere was not a lover to weep in concert with her, when she watered it\nwith her tears.--Alas! Alas!\n\nIf my readers would excuse the sportiveness of fancy, and give me credit\nfor genius, I would go on and tell them such tales as would force the\nsweet tears of sensibility to flow in copious showers down beautiful\ncheeks, to the discomposure of rouge, &c. &c. Nay, I would make it so\ninteresting, that the fair peruser should beg the hair-dresser to\nsettle the curls himself, and not interrupt her.\n\nShe had besides another resource, two most beautiful dogs, who shared\nher bed, and reclined on cushions near her all the day. These she\nwatched with the most assiduous care, and bestowed on them the warmest\ncaresses. This fondness for animals was not that kind of\n_attendrissement_ which makes a person take pleasure in providing for\nthe subsistence and comfort of a living creature; but it proceeded from\nvanity, it gave her an opportunity of lisping out the prettiest French\nexpressions of ecstatic fondness, in accents that had never been attuned\nby tenderness.\n\nShe was chaste, according to the vulgar acceptation of the word, that\nis, she did not make any actual _faux pas_; she feared the world, and\nwas indolent; but then, to make amends for this seeming self-denial, she\nread all the sentimental novels, dwelt on the love-scenes, and, had she\nthought while she read, her mind would have been contaminated; as she\naccompanied the lovers to the lonely arbors, and would walk with them by\nthe clear light of the moon. She wondered her husband did not stay at\nhome. She was jealous--why did he not love her, sit by her side, squeeze\nher hand, and look unutterable things? Gentle reader, I will tell thee;\nthey neither of them felt what they could not utter. I will not pretend\nto say that they always annexed an idea to a word; but they had none of\nthose feelings which are not easily analyzed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. II.\n\n\nIn due time she brought forth a son, a feeble babe; and the following\nyear a daughter. After the mother's throes she felt very few sentiments\nof maternal tenderness: the children were given to nurses, and she\nplayed with her dogs. Want of exercise prevented the least chance of her\nrecovering strength; and two or three milk-fevers brought on a\nconsumption, to which her constitution tended. Her children all died in\ntheir infancy, except the two first, and she began to grow fond of the\nson, as he was remarkably handsome. For years she divided her time\nbetween the sofa, and the card-table. She thought not of death, though\non the borders of the grave; nor did any of the duties of her station\noccur to her as necessary. Her children were left in the nursery; and\nwhen Mary, the little blushing girl, appeared, she would send the\nawkward thing away. To own the truth, she was awkward enough, in a house\nwithout any play-mates; for her brother had been sent to school, and she\nscarcely knew how to employ herself; she would ramble about the garden,\nadmire the flowers, and play with the dogs. An old house-keeper told her\nstories, read to her, and, at last, taught her to read. Her mother\ntalked of enquiring for a governess when her health would permit; and,\nin the interim desired her own maid to teach her French. As she had\nlearned to read, she perused with avidity every book that came in her\nway. Neglected in every respect, and left to the operations of her own\nmind, she considered every thing that came under her inspection, and\nlearned to think. She had heard of a separate state, and that angels\nsometimes visited this earth. She would sit in a thick wood in the park,\nand talk to them; make little songs addressed to them, and sing them to\ntunes of her own composing; and her native wood notes wild were sweet\nand touching.\n\nHer father always exclaimed against female acquirements, and was glad\nthat his wife's indolence and ill health made her not trouble herself\nabout them. She had besides another reason, she did not wish to have a\nfine tall girl brought forward into notice as her daughter; she still\nexpected to recover, and figure away in the gay world. Her husband was\nvery tyrannical and passionate; indeed so very easily irritated when\ninebriated, that Mary was continually in dread lest he should frighten\nher mother to death; her sickness called forth all Mary's tenderness,\nand exercised her compassion so continually, that it became more than a\nmatch for self-love, and was the governing propensity of her heart\nthrough life. She was violent in her temper; but she saw her father's\nfaults, and would weep when obliged to compare his temper with her\nown.--She did more; artless prayers rose to Heaven for pardon, when she\nwas conscious of having erred; and her contrition was so exceedingly\npainful, that she watched diligently the first movements of anger and\nimpatience, to save herself this cruel remorse.\n\nSublime ideas filled her young mind--always connected with devotional\nsentiments; extemporary effusions of gratitude, and rhapsodies of\npraise would burst often from her, when she listened to the birds, or\npursued the deer. She would gaze on the moon, and ramble through the\ngloomy path, observing the various shapes the clouds assumed, and listen\nto the sea that was not far distant. The wandering spirits, which she\nimagined inhabited every part of nature, were her constant friends and\nconfidants. She began to consider the Great First Cause, formed just\nnotions of his attributes, and, in particular, dwelt on his wisdom and\ngoodness. Could she have loved her father or mother, had they returned\nher affection, she would not so soon, perhaps, have sought out a new\nworld.\n\nHer sensibility prompted her to search for an object to love; on earth\nit was not to be found: her mother had often disappointed her, and the\napparent partiality she shewed to her brother gave her exquisite\npain--produced a kind of habitual melancholy, led her into a fondness\nfor reading tales of woe, and made her almost realize the fictitious\ndistress.\n\nShe had not any notion of death till a little chicken expired at her\nfeet; and her father had a dog hung in a passion. She then concluded\nanimals had souls, or they would not have been subjected to the caprice\nof man; but what was the soul of man or beast? In this style year after\nyear rolled on, her mother still vegetating.\n\nA little girl who attended in the nursery fell sick. Mary paid her great\nattention; contrary to her wish, she was sent out of the house to her\nmother, a poor woman, whom necessity obliged to leave her sick child\nwhile she earned her daily bread. The poor wretch, in a fit of delirium\nstabbed herself, and Mary saw her dead body, and heard the dismal\naccount; and so strongly did it impress her imagination, that every\nnight of her life the bleeding corpse presented itself to her when the\nfirst began to slumber. Tortured by it, she at last made a vow, that if\nshe was ever mistress of a family she would herself watch over every\npart of it. The impression that this accident made was indelible.\n\nAs her mother grew imperceptibly worse and worse, her father, who did\nnot understand such a lingering complaint, imagined his wife was only\ngrown still more whimsical, and that if she could be prevailed on to\nexert herself, her health would soon be re-established. In general he\ntreated her with indifference; but when her illness at all interfered\nwith his pleasures, he expostulated in the most cruel manner, and\nvisibly harassed the invalid. Mary would then assiduously try to turn\nhis attention to something else; and when sent out of the room, would\nwatch at the door, until the storm was over, for unless it was, she\ncould not rest. Other causes also contributed to disturb her repose: her\nmother's luke-warm manner of performing her religious duties, filled her\nwith anguish; and when she observed her father's vices, the unbidden\ntears would flow. She was miserable when beggars were driven from the\ngate without being relieved; if she could do it unperceived, she would\ngive them her own breakfast, and feel gratified, when, in consequence of\nit, she was pinched by hunger.\n\nShe had once, or twice, told her little secrets to her mother; they were\nlaughed at, and she determined never to do it again. In this manner was\nshe left to reflect on her own feelings; and so strengthened were they\nby being meditated on, that her character early became singular and\npermanent. Her understanding was strong and clear, when not clouded by\nher feelings; but she was too much the creature of impulse, and the\nslave of compassion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. III.\n\n\nNear her father's house lived a poor widow, who had been brought up in\naffluence, but reduced to great distress by the extravagance of her\nhusband; he had destroyed his constitution while he spent his fortune;\nand dying, left his wife, and five small children, to live on a very\nscanty pittance. The eldest daughter was for some years educated by a\ndistant relation, a Clergyman. While she was with him a young gentleman,\nson to a man of property in the neighbourhood, took particular notice of\nher. It is true, he never talked of love; but then they played and sung\nin concert; drew landscapes together, and while she worked he read to\nher, cultivated her taste, and stole imperceptibly her heart. Just at\nthis juncture, when smiling, unanalyzed hope made every prospect bright,\nand gay expectation danced in her eyes, her benefactor died. She\nreturned to her mother--the companion of her youth forgot her, they took\nno more sweet counsel together. This disappointment spread a sadness\nover her countenance, and made it interesting. She grew fond of\nsolitude, and her character appeared similar to Mary's, though her\nnatural disposition was very different.\n\nShe was several years older than Mary, yet her refinement, her taste,\ncaught her eye, and she eagerly sought her friendship: before her return\nshe had assisted the family, which was almost reduced to the last ebb;\nand now she had another motive to actuate her.\n\nAs she had often occasion to send messages to Ann, her new friend,\nmistakes were frequently made; Ann proposed that in future they should\nbe written ones, to obviate this difficulty, and render their\nintercourse more agreeable. Young people are mostly fond of scribbling;\nMary had had very little instruction; but by copying her friend's\nletters, whose hand she admired, she soon became a proficient; a little\npractice made her write with tolerable correctness, and her genius gave\nforce to it. In conversation, and in writing, when she felt, she was\npathetic, tender and persuasive; and she expressed contempt with such\nenergy, that few could stand the flash of her eyes.\n\nAs she grew more intimate with Ann, her manners were softened, and she\nacquired a degree of equality in her behaviour: yet still her spirits\nwere fluctuating, and her movements rapid. She felt less pain on\naccount of her mother's partiality to her brother, as she hoped now to\nexperience the pleasure of being beloved; but this hope led her into new\nsorrows, and, as usual, paved the way for disappointment. Ann only felt\ngratitude; her heart was entirely engrossed by one object, and\nfriendship could not serve as a substitute; memory officiously retraced\npast scenes, and unavailing wishes made time loiter.\n\nMary was often hurt by the involuntary indifference which these\nconsequences produced. When her friend was all the world to her, she\nfound she was not as necessary to her happiness; and her delicate mind\ncould not bear to obtrude her affection, or receive love as an alms, the\noffspring of pity. Very frequently has she ran to her with delight, and\nnot perceiving any thing of the same kind in Ann's countenance, she has\nshrunk back; and, falling from one extreme into the other, instead of a\nwarm greeting that was just slipping from her tongue, her expressions\nseemed to be dictated by the most chilling insensibility.\n\nShe would then imagine that she looked sickly or unhappy, and then all\nher tenderness would return like a torrent, and bear away all\nreflection. In this manner was her sensibility called forth, and\nexercised, by her mother's illness, her friend's misfortunes, and her\nown unsettled mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IV.\n\n\nNear to her father's house was a range of mountains; some of them were,\nliterally speaking, cloud-capt, for on them clouds continually rested,\nand gave grandeur to the prospect; and down many of their sides the\nlittle bubbling cascades ran till they swelled a beautiful river.\nThrough the straggling trees and bushes the wind whistled, and on them\nthe birds sung, particularly the robins; they also found shelter in the\nivy of an old castle, a haunted one, as the story went; it was situated\non the brow of one of the mountains, and commanded a view of the sea.\nThis castle had been inhabited by some of her ancestors; and many tales\nhad the old house-keeper told her of the worthies who had resided there.\n\nWhen her mother frowned, and her friend looked cool, she would steal to\nthis retirement, where human foot seldom trod--gaze on the sea, observe\nthe grey clouds, or listen to the wind which struggled to free itself\nfrom the only thing that impeded its course. When more cheerful, she\nadmired the various dispositions of light and shade, the beautiful tints\nthe gleams of sunshine gave to the distant hills; then she rejoiced in\nexistence, and darted into futurity.\n\nOne way home was through the cavity of a rock covered with a thin layer\nof earth, just sufficient to afford nourishment to a few stunted shrubs\nand wild plants, which grew on its sides, and nodded over the summit. A\nclear stream broke out of it, and ran amongst the pieces of rocks\nfallen into it. Here twilight always reigned--it seemed the Temple of\nSolitude; yet, paradoxical as the assertion may appear, when the foot\nsounded on the rock, it terrified the intruder, and inspired a strange\nfeeling, as if the rightful sovereign was dislodged. In this retreat she\nread Thomson's Seasons, Young's Night-Thoughts, and Paradise Lost.\n\nAt a little distance from it were the huts of a few poor fishermen, who\nsupported their numerous children by their precarious labour. In these\nlittle huts she frequently rested, and denied herself every childish\ngratification, in order to relieve the necessities of the inhabitants.\nHer heart yearned for them, and would dance with joy when she had\nrelieved their wants, or afforded them pleasure.\n\nIn these pursuits she learned the luxury of doing good; and the sweet\ntears of benevolence frequently moistened her eyes, and gave them a\nsparkle which, exclusive of that, they had not; on the contrary, they\nwere rather fixed, and would never have been observed if her soul had\nnot animated them. They were not at all like those brilliant ones which\nlook like polished diamonds, and dart from every superfice, giving more\nlight to the beholders than they receive themselves.\n\nHer benevolence, indeed, knew no bounds; the distress of others carried\nher out of herself; and she rested not till she had relieved or\ncomforted them. The warmth of her compassion often made her so diligent,\nthat many things occurred to her, which might have escaped a less\ninterested observer.\n\nIn like manner, she entered with such spirit into whatever she read,\nand the emotions thereby raised were so strong, that it soon became a\npart of her mind.\n\nEnthusiastic sentiments of devotion at this period actuated her; her\nCreator was almost apparent to her senses in his works; but they were\nmostly the grand or solemn features of Nature which she delighted to\ncontemplate. She would stand and behold the waves rolling, and think of\nthe voice that could still the tumultuous deep.\n\nThese propensities gave the colour to her mind, before the passions\nbegan to exercise their tyrannic sway, and particularly pointed out\nthose which the soil would have a tendency to nurse.\n\nYears after, when wandering through the same scenes, her imagination has\nstrayed back, to trace the first placid sentiments they inspired, and\nshe would earnestly desire to regain the same peaceful tranquillity.\n\nMany nights she sat up, if I may be allowed the expression, _conversing_\nwith the Author of Nature, making verses, and singing hymns of her own\ncomposing. She considered also, and tried to discern what end her\nvarious faculties were destined to pursue; and had a glimpse of a truth,\nwhich afterwards more fully unfolded itself.\n\nShe thought that only an infinite being could fill the human soul, and\nthat when other objects were followed as a means of happiness, the\ndelusion led to misery, the consequence of disappointment. Under the\ninfluence of ardent affections, how often has she forgot this\nconviction, and as often returned to it again, when it struck her with\nredoubled force. Often did she taste unmixed delight; her joys, her\necstacies arose from genius.\n\nShe was now fifteen, and she wished to receive the holy sacrament; and\nperusing the scriptures, and discussing some points of doctrine which\npuzzled her, she would sit up half the night, her favourite time for\nemploying her mind; she too plainly perceived that she saw through a\nglass darkly; and that the bounds set to stop our intellectual\nresearches, is one of the trials of a probationary state.\n\nBut her affections were roused by the display of divine mercy; and she\neagerly desired to commemorate the dying love of her great benefactor.\nThe night before the important day, when she was to take on herself her\nbaptismal vow, she could not go to bed; the sun broke in on her\nmeditations, and found her not exhausted by her watching.\n\nThe orient pearls were strewed around--she hailed the morn, and sung\nwith wild delight, Glory to God on high, good will towards men. She was\nindeed so much affected when she joined in the prayer for her eternal\npreservation, that she could hardly conceal her violent emotions; and\nthe recollection never failed to wake her dormant piety when earthly\npassions made it grow languid.\n\nThese various movements of her mind were not commented on, nor were the\nluxuriant shoots restrained by culture. The servants and the poor adored\nher.\n\nIn order to be enabled to gratify herself in the highest degree, she\npracticed the most rigid oeconomy, and had such power over her\nappetites and whims, that without any great effort she conquered them\nso entirely, that when her understanding or affections had an object,\nshe almost forgot she had a body which required nourishment.\n\nThis habit of thinking, this kind of absorption, gave strength to the\npassions.\n\nWe will now enter on the more active field of life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. V.\n\n\nA few months after Mary was turned of seventeen, her brother was\nattacked by a violent fever, and died before his father could reach the\nschool.\n\nShe was now an heiress, and her mother began to think her of\nconsequence, and did not call her _the child_. Proper masters were sent\nfor; she was taught to dance, and an extraordinary master procured to\nperfect her in that most necessary of all accomplishments.\n\nA part of the estate she was to inherit had been litigated, and the heir\nof the person who still carried on a Chancery suit, was only two years\nyounger than our heroine. The fathers, spite of the dispute, frequently\nmet, and, in order to settle it amicably, they one day, over a bottle,\ndetermined to quash it by a marriage, and, by uniting the two estates,\nto preclude all farther enquiries into the merits of their different\nclaims.\n\nWhile this important matter was settling, Mary was otherwise employed.\nAnn's mother's resources were failing; and the ghastly phantom, poverty,\nmade hasty strides to catch them in his clutches. Ann had not fortitude\nenough to brave such accumulated misery; besides, the canker-worm was\nlodged in her heart, and preyed on her health. She denied herself every\nlittle comfort; things that would be no sacrifice when a person is well,\nare absolutely necessary to alleviate bodily pain, and support the\nanimal functions.\n\nThere were many elegant amusements, that she had acquired a relish for,\nwhich might have taken her mind off from its most destructive bent; but\nthese her indigence would not allow her to enjoy: forced then, by way of\nrelaxation, to play the tunes her lover admired, and handle the pencil\nhe taught her to hold, no wonder his image floated on her imagination,\nand that taste invigorated love.\n\nPoverty, and all its inelegant attendants, were in her mother's abode;\nand she, though a good sort of a woman, was not calculated to banish, by\nher trivial, uninteresting chat, the delirium in which her daughter was\nlost.\n\nThis ill-fated love had given a bewitching softness to her manners, a\ndelicacy so truly feminine, that a man of any feeling could not behold\nher without wishing to chase her sorrows away. She was timid and\nirresolute, and rather fond of dissipation; grief only had power to make\nher reflect.\n\nIn every thing it was not the great, but the beautiful, or the pretty,\nthat caught her attention. And in composition, the polish of style, and\nharmony of numbers, interested her much more than the flights of genius,\nor abstracted speculations.\n\nShe often wondered at the books Mary chose, who, though she had a lively\nimagination, would frequently study authors whose works were addressed\nto the understanding. This liking taught her to arrange her thoughts,\nand argue with herself, even when under the influence of the most\nviolent passions.\n\nAnn's misfortunes and ill health were strong ties to bind Mary to her;\nshe wished so continually to have a home to receive her in, that it\ndrove every other desire out of her mind; and, dwelling on the tender\nschemes which compassion and friendship dictated, she longed most\nardently to put them in practice.\n\nFondly as she loved her friend, she did not forget her mother, whose\ndecline was so imperceptible, that they were not aware of her\napproaching dissolution. The physician, however, observing the most\nalarming symptoms; her husband was apprised of her immediate danger; and\nthen first mentioned to her his designs with respect to his daughter.\n\nShe approved of them; Mary was sent for; she was not at home; she had\nrambled to visit Ann, and found her in an hysteric fit. The landlord of\nher little farm had sent his agent for the rent, which had long been due\nto him; and he threatened to seize the stock that still remained, and\nturn them out, if they did not very shortly discharge the arrears.\n\nAs this man made a private fortune by harassing the tenants of the\nperson to whom he was deputy, little was to be expected from his\nforbearance.\n\nAll this was told to Mary--and the mother added, she had many other\ncreditors who would, in all probability, take the alarm, and snatch from\nthem all that had been saved out of the wreck. \"I could bear all,\" she\ncried; \"but what will become of my children? Of this child,\" pointing to\nthe fainting Ann, \"whose constitution is already undermined by care and\ngrief--where will she go?\"--Mary's heart ceased to beat while she asked\nthe question--She attempted to speak; but the inarticulate sounds died\naway. Before she had recovered herself, her father called himself to\nenquire for her; and desired her instantly to accompany him home.\n\nEngrossed by the scene of misery she had been witness to, she walked\nsilently by his side, when he roused her out of her reverie by telling\nher that in all likelihood her mother had not many hours to live; and\nbefore she could return him any answer, informed her that they had both\ndetermined to marry her to Charles, his friend's son; he added, the\nceremony was to be performed directly, that her mother might be witness\nof it; for such a desire she had expressed with childish eagerness.\n\nOverwhelmed by this intelligence, Mary rolled her eyes about, then, with\na vacant stare, fixed them on her father's face; but they were no longer\na sense; they conveyed no ideas to the brain. As she drew near the\nhouse, her wonted presence of mind returned: after this suspension of\nthought, a thousand darted into her mind,--her dying mother,--her\nfriend's miserable situation,--and an extreme horror at taking--at being\nforced to take, such a hasty step; but she did not feel the disgust, the\nreluctance, which arises from a prior attachment.\n\nShe loved Ann better than any one in the world--to snatch her from the\nvery jaws of destruction--she would have encountered a lion. To have\nthis friend constantly with her; to make her mind easy with respect to\nher family, would it not be superlative bliss?\n\nFull of these thoughts she entered her mother's chamber, but they then\nfled at the sight of a dying parent. She went to her, took her hand; it\nfeebly pressed her's. \"My child,\" said the languid mother: the words\nreached her heart; she had seldom heard them pronounced with accents\ndenoting affection; \"My child, I have not always treated you with\nkindness--God forgive me! do you?\"--Mary's tears strayed in a\ndisregarded stream; on her bosom the big drops fell, but did not relieve\nthe fluttering tenant. \"I forgive you!\" said she, in a tone of\nastonishment.\n\nThe clergyman came in to read the service for the sick, and afterwards\nthe marriage ceremony was performed. Mary stood like a statue of\nDespair, and pronounced the awful vow without thinking of it; and then\nran to support her mother, who expired the same night in her arms.\n\nHer husband set off for the continent the same day, with a tutor, to\nfinish his studies at one of the foreign universities.\n\nAnn was sent for to console her, not on account of the departure of her\nnew relation, a boy she seldom took any notice of, but to reconcile her\nto her fate; besides, it was necessary she should have a female\ncompanion, and there was not any maiden aunt in the family, or cousin of\nthe same class.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VI.\n\n\nMary was allowed to pay the rent which gave her so much uneasiness, and\nshe exerted every nerve to prevail on her father effectually to succour\nthe family; but the utmost she could obtain was a small sum very\ninadequate to the purpose, to enable the poor woman to carry into\nexecution a little scheme of industry near the metropolis.\n\nHer intention of leaving that part of the country, had much more weight\nwith him, than Mary's arguments, drawn from motives of philanthropy and\nfriendship; this was a language he did not understand; expressive of\noccult qualities he never thought of, as they could not be seen or\nfelt.\n\nAfter the departure of her mother, Ann still continued to languish,\nthough she had a nurse who was entirely engrossed by the desire of\namusing her. Had her health been re-established, the time would have\npassed in a tranquil, improving manner.\n\nDuring the year of mourning they lived in retirement; music, drawing,\nand reading, filled up the time; and Mary's taste and judgment were both\nimproved by contracting a habit of observation, and permitting the\nsimple beauties of Nature to occupy her thoughts.\n\nShe had a wonderful quickness in discerning distinctions and combining\nideas, that at the first glance did not appear to be similar. But these\nvarious pursuits did not banish all her cares, or carry off all her\nconstitutional black bile. Before she enjoyed Ann's society, she\nimagined it would have made her completely happy: she was disappointed,\nand yet knew not what to complain of.\n\nAs her friend could not accompany her in her walks, and wished to be\nalone, for a very obvious reason, she would return to her old haunts,\nretrace her anticipated pleasures--and wonder how they changed their\ncolour in possession, and proved so futile.\n\nShe had not yet found the companion she looked for. Ann and she were not\ncongenial minds, nor did she contribute to her comfort in the degree she\nexpected. She shielded her from poverty; but this was only a negative\nblessing; when under the pressure it was very grievous, and still more\nso were the apprehensions; but when exempt from them, she was not\ncontented.\n\nSuch is human nature, its laws were not to be inverted to gratify our\nheroine, and stop the progress of her understanding, happiness only\nflourished in paradise--we cannot taste and live.\n\nAnother year passed away with increasing apprehensions. Ann had a hectic\ncough, and many unfavourable prognostics: Mary then forgot every thing\nbut the fear of losing her, and even imagined that her recovery would\nhave made her happy.\n\nHer anxiety led her to study physic, and for some time she only read\nbooks of that cast; and this knowledge, literally speaking, ended in\nvanity and vexation of spirit, as it enabled her to foresee what she\ncould not prevent.\n\nAs her mind expanded, her marriage appeared a dreadful misfortune; she\nwas sometimes reminded of the heavy yoke, and bitter was the\nrecollection!\n\nIn one thing there seemed to be a sympathy between them, for she wrote\nformal answers to his as formal letters. An extreme dislike took root in\nher mind; the found of his name made her turn sick; but she forgot all,\nlistening to Ann's cough, and supporting her languid frame. She would\nthen catch her to her bosom with convulsive eagerness, as if to save her\nfrom sinking into an opening grave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VII.\n\n\nIt was the will of Providence that Mary should experience almost every\nspecies of sorrow. Her father was thrown from his horse, when his blood\nwas in a very inflammatory state, and the bruises were very dangerous;\nhis recovery was not expected by the physical tribe.\n\nTerrified at seeing him so near death, and yet so ill prepared for it,\nhis daughter sat by his bed, oppressed by the keenest anguish, which her\npiety increased.\n\nHer grief had nothing selfish in it; he was not a friend or protector;\nbut he was her father, an unhappy wretch, going into eternity, depraved\nand thoughtless. Could a life of sensuality be a preparation for a\npeaceful death? Thus meditating, she passed the still midnight hour by\nhis bedside.\n\nThe nurse fell asleep, nor did a violent thunder storm interrupt her\nrepose, though it made the night appear still more terrific to Mary. Her\nfather's unequal breathing alarmed her, when she heard a long drawn\nbreath, she feared it was his last, and watching for another, a dreadful\npeal of thunder struck her ears. Considering the separation of the soul\nand body, this night seemed sadly solemn, and the hours long.\n\nDeath is indeed a king of terrors when he attacks the vicious man! The\ncompassionate heart finds not any comfort; but dreads an eternal\nseparation. No transporting greetings are anticipated, when the\nsurvivors also shall have finished their course; but all is black!--the\ngrave may truly be said to receive the departed--this is the sting of\ndeath!\n\nNight after night Mary watched, and this excessive fatigue impaired her\nown health, but had a worse effect on Ann; though she constantly went to\nbed, she could not rest; a number of uneasy thoughts obtruded\nthemselves; and apprehensions about Mary, whom she loved as well as her\nexhausted heart could love, harassed her mind. After a sleepless,\nfeverish night she had a violent fit of coughing, and burst a\nblood-vessel. The physician, who was in the house, was sent for, and\nwhen he left the patient, Mary, with an authoritative voice, insisted on\nknowing his real opinion. Reluctantly he gave it, that her friend was in\na critical state; and if she passed the approaching winter in England,\nhe imagined she would die in the spring; a season fatal to consumptive\ndisorders. The spring!--Her husband was then expected.--Gracious Heaven,\ncould she bear all this.\n\nIn a few days her father breathed his last. The horrid sensations his\ndeath occasioned were too poignant to be durable: and Ann's danger, and\nher own situation, made Mary deliberate what mode of conduct she should\npursue. She feared this event might hasten the return of her husband,\nand prevent her putting into execution a plan she had determined on. It\nwas to accompany Ann to a more salubrious climate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VIII.\n\n\nI mentioned before, that Mary had never had any particular attachment,\nto give rise to the disgust that daily gained ground. Her friendship for\nAnn occupied her heart, and resembled a passion. She had had, indeed,\nseveral transient likings; but they did not amount to love. The society\nof men of genius delighted her, and improved her faculties. With beings\nof this class she did not often meet; it is a rare genus; her first\nfavourites were men past the meridian of life, and of a philosophic\nturn.\n\nDetermined on going to the South of France, or Lisbon; she wrote to the\nman she had promised to obey. The physicians had said change of air was\nnecessary for her as well as her friend. She mentioned this, and added,\n\"Her comfort, almost her existence, depended on the recovery of the\ninvalid she wished to attend; and that should she neglect to follow the\nmedical advice she had received, she should never forgive herself, or\nthose who endeavoured to prevent her.\" Full of her design, she wrote\nwith more than usual freedom; and this letter was like most of her\nothers, a transcript of her heart.\n\n\"This dear friend,\" she exclaimed, \"I love for her agreeable qualities,\nand substantial virtues. Continual attention to her health, and the\ntender office of a nurse, have created an affection very like a maternal\none--I am her only support, she leans on me--could I forsake the\nforsaken, and break the bruised reed--No--I would die first! I must--I\nwill go.\"\n\nShe would have added, \"you would very much oblige me by consenting;\" but\nher heart revolted--and irresolutely she wrote something about wishing\nhim happy.--\"Do I not wish all the world well?\" she cried, as she\nsubscribed her name--It was blotted, the letter sealed in a hurry, and\nsent out of her sight; and she began to prepare for her journey.\n\nBy the return of the post she received an answer; it contained some\ncommon-place remarks on her romantic friendship, as he termed it; \"But\nas the physicians advised change of air, he had no objection.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IX.\n\n\nThere was nothing now to retard their journey; and Mary chose Lisbon\nrather than France, on account of its being further removed from the\nonly person she wished not to see.\n\nThey set off accordingly for Falmouth, in their way to that city. The\njourney was of use to Ann, and Mary's spirits were raised by her\nrecovered looks--She had been in despair--now she gave way to hope, and\nwas intoxicated with it. On ship-board Ann always remained in the cabin;\nthe sight of the water terrified her: on the contrary, Mary, after she\nwas gone to bed, or when she fell asleep in the day, went on deck,\nconversed with the sailors, and surveyed the boundless expanse before\nher with delight. One instant she would regard the ocean, the next the\nbeings who braved its fury. Their insensibility and want of fear, she\ncould not name courage; their thoughtless mirth was quite of an animal\nkind, and their feelings as impetuous and uncertain as the element they\nplowed.\n\nThey had only been a week at sea when they hailed the rock of Lisbon,\nand the next morning anchored at the castle. After the customary visits,\nthey were permitted to go on shore, about three miles from the city; and\nwhile one of the crew, who understood the language, went to procure them\none of the ugly carriages peculiar to the country, they waited in the\nIrish convent, which is situated close to the Tagus.\n\nSome of the people offered to conduct them into the church, where there\nwas a fine organ playing; Mary followed them, but Ann preferred staying\nwith a nun she had entered into conversation with.\n\nOne of the nuns, who had a sweet voice, was singing; Mary was struck\nwith awe; her heart joined in the devotion; and tears of gratitude and\ntenderness flowed from her eyes. My Father, I thank thee! burst from\nher--words were inadequate to express her feelings. Silently, she\nsurveyed the lofty dome; heard unaccustomed sounds; and saw faces,\nstrange ones, that she could not yet greet with fraternal love.\n\nIn an unknown land, she considered that the Being she adored inhabited\neternity, was ever present in unnumbered worlds. When she had not any\none she loved near her, she was particularly sensible of the presence\nof her Almighty Friend.\n\nThe arrival of the carriage put a stop to her speculations; it was to\nconduct them to an hotel, fitted up for the reception of invalids.\nUnfortunately, before they could reach it there was a violent shower of\nrain; and as the wind was very high, it beat against the leather\ncurtains, which they drew along the front of the vehicle, to shelter\nthemselves from it; but it availed not, some of the rain forced its way,\nand Ann felt the effects of it, for she caught cold, spite of Mary's\nprecautions.\n\nAs is the custom, the rest of the invalids, or lodgers, sent to enquire\nafter their health; and as soon as Ann left her chamber, in which her\ncomplaints seldom confined her the whole day, they came in person to pay\ntheir compliments. Three fashionable females, and two gentlemen; the\none a brother of the eldest of the young ladies, and the other an\ninvalid, who came, like themselves, for the benefit of the air. They\nentered into conversation immediately.\n\nPeople who meet in a strange country, and are all together in a house,\nsoon get acquainted, without the formalities which attend visiting in\nseparate houses, where they are surrounded by domestic friends. Ann was\nparticularly delighted at meeting with agreeable society; a little\nhectic fever generally made her low-spirited in the morning, and lively\nin the evening, when she wished for company. Mary, who only thought of\nher, determined to cultivate their acquaintance, as she knew, that if\nher mind could be diverted, her body might gain strength.\n\nThey were all musical, and proposed having little concerts. One of the\ngentlemen played on the violin, and the other on the german-flute. The\ninstruments were brought in, with all the eagerness that attends putting\na new scheme in execution.\n\nMary had not said much, for she was diffident; she seldom joined in\ngeneral conversations; though her quickness of penetration enabled her\nsoon to enter into the characters of those she conversed with; and her\nsensibility made her desirous of pleasing every human creature. Besides,\nif her mind was not occupied by any particular sorrow, or study, she\ncaught reflected pleasure, and was glad to see others happy, though\ntheir mirth did not interest her.\n\nThis day she was continually thinking of Ann's recovery, and encouraging\nthe cheerful hopes, which though they dissipated the spirits that had\nbeen condensed by melancholy, yet made her wish to be silent. The music,\nmore than the conversation, disturbed her reflections; but not at first.\nThe gentleman who played on the german-flute, was a handsome, well-bred,\nsensible man; and his observations, if not original, were pertinent.\n\nThe other, who had not said much, began to touch the violin, and played\na little Scotch ballad; he brought such a thrilling sound out of the\ninstrument, that Mary started, and looking at him with more attention\nthan she had done before, and saw, in a face rather ugly, strong lines\nof genius. His manners were awkward, that kind of awkwardness which is\noften found in literary men: he seemed a thinker, and delivered his\nopinions in elegant expressions, and musical tones of voice.\n\nWhen the concert was over, they all retired to their apartments. Mary\nalways slept with Ann, as she was subject to terrifying dreams; and\nfrequently in the night was obliged to be supported, to avoid\nsuffocation. They chatted about their new acquaintance in their own\napartment, and, with respect to the gentlemen, differed in opinion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. X.\n\n\nEvery day almost they saw their new acquaintance; and civility produced\nintimacy. Mary sometimes left her friend with them; while she indulged\nherself in viewing new modes of life, and searching out the causes which\nproduced them. She had a metaphysical turn, which inclined her to\nreflect on every object that passed by her; and her mind was not like a\nmirror, which receives every floating image, but does not retain them:\nshe had not any prejudices, for every opinion was examined before it was\nadopted.\n\nThe Roman Catholic ceremonies attracted her attention, and gave rise to\nconversations when they all met; and one of the gentlemen continually\nintroduced deistical notions, when he ridiculed the pageantry they all\nwere surprised at observing. Mary thought of both the subjects, the\nRomish tenets, and the deistical doubts; and though not a sceptic,\nthought it right to examine the evidence on which her faith was built.\nShe read Butler's Analogy, and some other authors: and these researches\nmade her a christian from conviction, and she learned charity,\nparticularly with respect to sectaries; saw that apparently good and\nsolid arguments might take their rise from different points of view; and\nshe rejoiced to find that those she should not concur with had some\nreason on their side.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XI.\n\n\nWhen I mentioned the three ladies, I said they were fashionable women;\nand it was all the praise, as a faithful historian, I could bestow on\nthem; the only thing in which they were consistent. I forgot to mention\nthat they were all of one family, a mother, her daughter, and niece. The\ndaughter was sent by her physician, to avoid a northerly winter; the\nmother, her niece, and nephew, accompanied her.\n\nThey were people of rank; but unfortunately, though of an ancient\nfamily, the title had descended to a very remote branch--a branch they\ntook care to be intimate with; and servilely copied the Countess's\nairs. Their minds were shackled with a set of notions concerning\npropriety, the fitness of things for the world's eye, trammels which\nalways hamper weak people. What will the world say? was the first thing\nthat was thought of, when they intended doing any thing they had not\ndone before. Or what would the Countess do on such an occasion? And when\nthis question was answered, the right or wrong was discovered without\nthe trouble of their having any idea of the matter in their own heads.\nThis same Countess was a fine planet, and the satellites observed a most\nharmonic dance around her.\n\nAfter this account it is scarcely necessary to add, that their minds had\nreceived very little cultivation. They were taught French, Italian, and\nSpanish; English was their vulgar tongue. And what did they learn?\nHamlet will tell you--words--words. But let me not forget that they\nsqualled Italian songs in the true _gusto_. Without having any seeds\nsown in their understanding, or the affections of the heart set to work,\nthey were brought out of their nursery, or the place they were secluded\nin, to prevent their faces being common; like blazing stars, to\ncaptivate Lords.\n\nThey were pretty, and hurrying from one party of pleasure to another,\noccasioned the disorder which required change of air. The mother, if we\nexcept her being near twenty years older, was just the same creature;\nand these additional years only served to make her more tenaciously\nadhere to her habits of folly, and decide with stupid gravity, some\ntrivial points of ceremony, as a matter of the last importance; of\nwhich she was a competent judge, from having lived in the fashionable\nworld so long: that world to which the ignorant look up as we do to the\nsun.\n\nIt appears to me that every creature has some notion--or rather relish,\nof the sublime. Riches, and the consequent state, are the sublime of\nweak minds:--These images fill, nay, are too big for their narrow souls.\n\nOne afternoon, which they had engaged to spend together, Ann was so ill,\nthat Mary was obliged to send an apology for not attending the\ntea-table. The apology brought them on the carpet; and the mother, with\na look of solemn importance, turned to the sick man, whose name was\nHenry, and said;\n\n\"Though people of the first fashion are frequently at places of this\nkind, intimate with they know not who; yet I do not choose that my\ndaughter, whose family is so respectable, should be intimate with any\none she would blush to know elsewhere. It is only on that account, for I\nnever suffer her to be with any one but in my company,\" added she,\nsitting more erect; and a smile of self-complacency dressed her\ncountenance.\n\n\"I have enquired concerning these strangers, and find that the one who\nhas the most dignity in her manners, is really a woman of fortune.\"\n\"Lord, mamma, how ill she dresses:\" mamma went on; \"She is a romantic\ncreature, you must not copy her, miss; yet she is an heiress of the\nlarge fortune in ----shire, of which you may remember to have heard the\nCountess speak the night you had on the dancing-dress that was so much\nadmired; but she is married.\"\n\nShe then told them the whole story as she heard it from her maid, who\npicked it out of Mary's servant. \"She is a foolish creature, and this\nfriend that she pays as much attention to as if she was a lady of\nquality, is a beggar.\" \"Well, how strange!\" cried the girls.\n\n\"She is, however, a charming creature,\" said her nephew. Henry sighed,\nand strode across the room once or twice; then took up his violin, and\nplayed the air which first struck Mary; he had often heard her praise\nit.\n\nThe music was uncommonly melodious, \"And came stealing on the senses\nlike the sweet south.\" The well-known sounds reached Mary as she sat by\nher friend--she listened without knowing that she did--and shed tears\nalmost without being conscious of it. Ann soon fell asleep, as she had\ntaken an opiate. Mary, then brooding over her fears, began to imagine\nshe had deceived herself--Ann was still very ill; hope had beguiled many\nheavy hours; yet she was displeased with herself for admitting this\nwelcome guest.--And she worked up her mind to such a degree of anxiety,\nthat she determined, once more, to seek medical aid.\n\nNo sooner did she determine, than she ran down with a discomposed look,\nto enquire of the ladies who she should send for. When she entered the\nroom she could not articulate her fears--it appeared like pronouncing\nAnn's sentence of death; her faultering tongue dropped some broken\nwords, and she remained silent. The ladies wondered that a person of her\nsense should be so little mistress of herself; and began to administer\nsome common-place comfort, as, that it was our duty to submit to the\nwill of Heaven, and the like trite consolations, which Mary did not\nanswer; but waving her hand, with an air of impatience, she exclaimed,\n\"I cannot live without her!--I have no other friend; if I lose her, what\na desart will the world be to me.\" \"No other friend,\" re-echoed they,\n\"have you not a husband?\"\n\nMary shrunk back, and was alternately pale and red. A delicate sense of\npropriety prevented her replying; and recalled her bewildered\nreason.--Assuming, in consequence of her recollection, a more composed\nmanner, she made the intended enquiry, and left the room. Henry's eyes\nfollowed her while the females very freely animadverted on her strange\nbehaviour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XII.\n\n\nThe physician was sent for; his prescription afforded Ann a little\ntemporary relief; and they again joined the circle. Unfortunately, the\nweather happened to be constantly wet for more than a week, and confined\nthem to the house. Ann then found the ladies not so agreeable; when they\nsat whole hours together, the thread-bare topics were exhausted; and,\nbut for cards or music, the long evenings would have been yawned away in\nlistless indolence.\n\nThe bad weather had had as ill an effect on Henry as on Ann. He was\nfrequently very thoughtful, or rather melancholy; this melancholy would\nof itself have attracted Mary's notice, if she had not found his\nconversation so infinitely superior to the rest of the group. When she\nconversed with him, all the faculties of her soul unfolded themselves;\ngenius animated her expressive countenance and the most graceful,\nunaffected gestures gave energy to her discourse.\n\nThey frequently discussed very important subjects, while the rest were\nsinging or playing cards, nor were they observed for doing so, as Henry,\nwhom they all were pleased with, in the way of gallantry shewed them all\nmore attention than her. Besides, as there was nothing alluring in her\ndress or manner, they never dreamt of her being preferred to them.\n\nHenry was a man of learning; he had also studied mankind, and knew many\nof the intricacies of the human heart, from having felt the infirmities\nof his own. His taste was just, as it had a standard--Nature, which he\nobserved with a critical eye. Mary could not help thinking that in his\ncompany her mind expanded, as he always went below the surface. She\nincreased her stock of ideas, and her taste was improved.\n\nHe was also a pious man; his rational religious sentiments received\nwarmth from his sensibility; and, except on very particular occasions,\nkept it in proper bounds; these sentiments had likewise formed his\ntemper; he was gentle, and easily to be intreated. The ridiculous\nceremonies they were every day witness to, led them into what are termed\ngrave subjects, and made him explain his opinions, which, at other\ntimes, he was neither ashamed of, nor unnecessarily brought forward to\nnotice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIII.\n\n\nWhen the weather began to clear up, Mary sometimes rode out alone,\npurposely to view the ruins that still remained of the earthquake: or\nshe would ride to the banks of the Tagus, to feast her eyes with the\nsight of that magnificent river. At other times she would visit the\nchurches, as she was particularly fond of seeing historical paintings.\n\nOne of these visits gave rise to the subject, and the whole party\ndescanted on it; but as the ladies could not handle it well, they soon\nadverted to portraits; and talked of the attitudes and characters in\nwhich they should wish to be drawn. Mary did not fix on one--when\nHenry, with more apparent warmth than usual, said, \"I would give the\nworld for your picture, with the expression I have seen in your face,\nwhen you have been supporting your friend.\"\n\nThis delicate compliment did not gratify her vanity, but it reached her\nheart. She then recollected that she had once sat for her picture--for\nwhom was it designed? For a boy! Her cheeks flushed with indignation, so\nstrongly did she feel an emotion of contempt at having been thrown\naway--given in with an estate.\n\nAs Mary again gave way to hope, her mind was more disengaged; and her\nthoughts were employed about the objects around her.\n\nShe visited several convents, and found that solitude only eradicates\nsome passions, to give strength to others; the most baneful ones. She\nsaw that religion does not consist in ceremonies; and that many prayers\nmay fall from the lips without purifying the heart.\n\nThey who imagine they can be religious without governing their tempers,\nor exercising benevolence in its most extensive sense, must certainly\nallow, that their religious duties are only practiced from selfish\nprinciples; how then can they be called good? The pattern of all\ngoodness went about _doing_ good. Wrapped up in themselves, the nuns\nonly thought of inferior gratifications. And a number of intrigues were\ncarried on to accelerate certain points on which their hearts were\nfixed:\n\nSuch as obtaining offices of trust or authority; or avoiding those that\nwere servile or laborious. In short, when they could be neither wives\nnor mothers, they aimed at being superiors, and became the most selfish\ncreatures in the world: the passions that were curbed gave strength to\nthe appetites, or to those mean passions which only tend to provide for\nthe gratification of them. Was this seclusion from the world? or did\nthey conquer its vanities or avoid its vexations?\n\nIn these abodes the unhappy individual, who, in the first paroxysm of\ngrief flies to them for refuge, finds too late she took a wrong step.\nThe same warmth which determined her will make her repent; and sorrow,\nthe rust of the mind, will never have a chance of being rubbed off by\nsensible conversation, or new-born affections of the heart.\n\nShe will find that those affections that have once been called forth and\nstrengthened by exercise, are only smothered, not killed, by\ndisappointment; and that in one form or other discontent will corrode\nthe heart, and produce those maladies of the imagination, for which\nthere is no specific.\n\nThe community at large Mary disliked; but pitied many of them whose\nprivate distresses she was informed of; and to pity and relieve were the\nsame things with her.\n\nThe exercise of her various virtues gave vigor to her genius, and\ndignity to her mind; she was sometimes inconsiderate, and violent; but\nnever mean or cunning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIV.\n\n\nThe Portuguese are certainly the most uncivilized nation in Europe. Dr.\nJohnson would have said, \"They have the least mind.\". And can such serve\ntheir Creator in spirit and in truth? No, the gross ritual of Romish\nceremonies is all they can comprehend: they can do penance, but not\nconquer their revenge, or lust. Religion, or love, has never humanized\ntheir hearts; they want the vital part; the mere body worships. Taste is\nunknown; Gothic finery, and unnatural decorations, which they term\nornaments, are conspicuous in their churches and dress. Reverence for\nmental excellence is only to be found in a polished nation.\n\nCould the contemplation of such a people gratify Mary's heart? No: she\nturned disgusted from the prospects--turned to a man of refinement.\nHenry had been some time ill and low-spirited; Mary would have been\nattentive to any one in that situation; but to him she was particularly\nso; she thought herself bound in gratitude, on account of his constant\nendeavours to amuse Ann, and prevent her dwelling on the dreary prospect\nbefore her, which sometimes she could not help anticipating with a kind\nof quiet despair.\n\nShe found some excuse for going more frequently into the room they all\nmet in; nay, she avowed her desire to amuse him: offered to read to him,\nand tried to draw him into amusing conversations; and when she was full\nof these little schemes, she looked at him with a degree of tenderness\nthat she was not conscious of. This divided attention was of use to her,\nand prevented her continually thinking of Ann, whose fluctuating\ndisorder often gave rise to false hopes.\n\nA trifling thing occurred now which occasioned Mary some uneasiness. Her\nmaid, a well-looking girl, had captivated the clerk of a neighbouring\ncompting-house. As the match was an advantageous one, Mary could not\nraise any objection to it, though at this juncture it was very\ndisagreeable to her to have a stranger about her person. However, the\ngirl consented to delay the marriage, as she had some affection for her\nmistress; and, besides, looked forward to Ann's death as a time of\nharvest.\n\nHenry's illness was not alarming, it was rather pleasing, as it gave\nMary an excuse to herself for shewing him how much she was interested\nabout him; and giving little artless proofs of affection, which the\npurity of her heart made her never wish to restrain.\n\nThe only visible return he made was not obvious to common observers. He\nwould sometimes fix his eyes on her, and take them off with a sigh that\nwas coughed away; or when he was leisurely walking into the room, and\ndid not expect to see her, he would quicken his steps, and come up to\nher with eagerness to ask some trivial question. In the same style, he\nwould try to detain her when he had nothing to say--or said nothing.\n\nAnn did not take notice of either his or Mary's behaviour, nor did she\nsuspect that he was a favourite, on any other account than his\nappearing neither well nor happy. She had often seen that when a person\nwas unfortunate, Mary's pity might easily be mistaken for love, and,\nindeed, it was a temporary sensation of that kind. Such it was--why it\nwas so, let others define, I cannot argue against instincts. As reason\nis cultivated in man, they are supposed to grow weaker, and this may\nhave given rise to the assertion, \"That as judgment improves, genius\nevaporates.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XV.\n\n\nOne morning they set out to visit the aqueduct; though the day was very\nfine when they left home, a very heavy shower fell before they reached\nit; they lengthened their ride, the clouds dispersed, and the sun came\nfrom behind them uncommonly bright.\n\nMary would fain have persuaded Ann not to have left the carriage; but\nshe was in spirits, and obviated all her objections, and insisted on\nwalking, tho' the ground was damp. But her strength was not equal to her\nspirits; she was soon obliged to return to the carriage so much\nfatigued, that she fainted, and remained insensible a long time.\n\nHenry would have supported her; but Mary would not permit him; her\nrecollection was instantaneous, and she feared sitting on the damp\nground might do him a material injury: she was on that account positive,\nthough the company did not guess the cause of her being so. As to\nherself, she did not fear bodily pain; and, when her mind was agitated,\nshe could endure the greatest fatigue without appearing sensible of it.\n\nWhen Ann recovered, they returned slowly home; she was carried to bed,\nand the next morning Mary thought she observed a visible change for the\nworse. The physician was sent for, who pronounced her to be in the most\nimminent danger.\n\nAll Mary's former fears now returned like a torrent, and carried every\nother care away; she even added to her present anguish by upbraiding\nherself for her late tranquillity--it haunted her in the form of a\ncrime.\n\nThe disorder made the most rapid advances--there was no hope!--Bereft of\nit, Mary again was tranquil; but it was a very different kind of\ntranquillity. She stood to brave the approaching storm, conscious she\nonly could be overwhelmed by it.\n\nShe did not think of Henry, or if her thoughts glanced towards him, it\nwas only to find fault with herself for suffering a thought to have\nstrayed from Ann.--Ann!--this dear friend was soon torn from her--she\ndied suddenly as Mary was assisting her to walk across the room.--The\nfirst string was severed from her heart--and this \"slow, sudden-death\"\ndisturbed her reasoning faculties; she seemed stunned by it; unable to\nreflect, or even to feel her misery.\n\nThe body was stolen out of the house the second night, and Mary refused\nto see her former companions. She desired her maid to conclude her\nmarriage, and request her intended husband to inform her when the first\nmerchantman was to leave the port, as the packet had just sailed, and\nshe determined not to stay in that hated place any longer than was\nabsolutely necessary.\n\nShe then sent to request the ladies to visit her; she wished to avoid a\nparade of grief--her sorrows were her own, and appeared to her not to\nadmit of increase or softening. She was right; the sight of them did not\naffect her, or turn the stream of her sullen sorrow; the black wave\nrolled along in the same course, it was equal to her where she cast her\neyes; all was impenetrable gloom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVI.\n\n\nSoon after the ladies left her, she received a message from Henry,\nrequesting, as she saw company, to be permitted to visit her: she\nconsented, and he entered immediately, with an unassured pace. She ran\neagerly up to him--saw the tear trembling in his eye, and his\ncountenance softened by the tenderest compassion; the hand which pressed\nhers seemed that of a fellow-creature. She burst into tears; and, unable\nto restrain them, she hid her face with both her hands; these tears\nrelieved her, (she had before had a difficulty in breathing,) and she\nsat down by him more composed than she had appeared since Ann's death;\nbut her conversation was incoherent.\n\nShe called herself \"a poor disconsolate creature!\"--\"Mine is a selfish\ngrief,\" she exclaimed--\"Yet; Heaven is my witness, I do not wish her\nback now she has reached those peaceful mansions, where the weary rest.\nHer pure spirit is happy; but what a wretch am I!\"\n\nHenry forgot his cautious reserve. \"Would you allow me to call you\nfriend?\" said he in a hesitating voice. \"I feel, dear girl, the tendered\ninterest in whatever concerns thee.\" His eyes spoke the rest. They were\nboth silent a few moments; then Henry resumed the conversation. \"I have\nalso been acquainted with grief! I mourn the loss of a woman who was not\nworthy of my regard. Let me give thee some account of the man who now\nsolicits thy friendship; and who, from motives of the purest\nbenevolence, wishes to give comfort to thy wounded heart.\"\n\n\"I have myself,\" said he, mournfully, \"shaken hands with happiness, and\nam dead to the world; I wait patiently for my dissolution; but, for\nthee, Mary, there may be many bright days in store.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" replied she, in a peevish tone, as if he had insulted her\nby the supposition; her feelings were so much in unison with his, that\nshe was in love with misery.\n\nHe smiled at her impatience, and went on. \"My father died before I knew\nhim, and my mother was so attached to my eldest brother, that she took\nvery little pains to fit me for the profession to which I was destined:\nand, may I tell thee, I left my family, and, in many different stations,\nrambled about the world; saw mankind in every rank of life; and, in\norder to be independent, exerted those talents Nature has given me:\nthese exertions improved my understanding; and the miseries I was\nwitness to, gave a keener edge to my sensibility. My constitution is\nnaturally weak; and, perhaps, two or three lingering disorders in my\nyouth, first gave me a habit of reflecting, and enabled me to obtain\nsome dominion over my passions. At least,\" added he, stifling a sigh,\n\"over the violent ones, though I fear, refinement and reflection only\nrenders the tender ones more tyrannic.\n\n\"I have told you already I have been in love, and disappointed--the\nobject is now no more; let her faults sleep with her! Yet this passion\nhas pervaded my whole soul, and mixed itself with all my affections and\npursuits.--I am not peacefully indifferent; yet it is only to my violin\nI tell the sorrows I now confide with thee. The object I loved forfeited\nmy esteem; yet, true to the sentiment, my fancy has too frequently\ndelighted to form a creature that I could love, that could convey to my\nsoul sensations which the gross part of mankind have not any conception\nof.\"\n\nHe stopped, as Mary seemed lost in thought; but as she was still in a\nlistening attitude, continued his little narrative. \"I kept up an\nirregular correspondence with my mother; my brother's extravagance and\ningratitude had almost broken her heart, and made her feel something\nlike a pang of remorse, on account of her behaviour to me. I hastened to\ncomfort her--and was a comfort to her.\n\n\"My declining health prevented my taking orders, as I had intended; but\nI with warmth entered into literary pursuits; perhaps my heart, not\nhaving an object, made me embrace the substitute with more eagerness.\nBut, do not imagine I have always been a die-away swain. No: I have\nfrequented the cheerful haunts of men, and wit!--enchanting wit! has\nmade many moments fly free from care. I am too fond of the elegant arts;\nand woman--lovely woman! thou hast charmed me, though, perhaps, it would\nnot be easy to find one to whom my reason would allow me to be constant.\n\n\"I have now only to tell you, that my mother insisted on my spending\nthis winter in a warmer climate; and I fixed on Lisbon, as I had before\nvisited the Continent.\" He then looked Mary full in the face; and, with\nthe most insinuating accents, asked \"if he might hope for her\nfriendship? If she would rely on him as if he was her father; and that\nthe tenderest father could not more anxiously interest himself in the\nfate of a darling child, than he did in her's.\"\n\nSuch a crowd of thoughts all at once rushed into Mary's mind, that she\nin vain attempted to express the sentiments which were most predominant.\nHer heart longed to receive a new guest; there was a void in it:\naccustomed to have some one to love, she was alone, and comfortless, if\nnot engrossed by a particular affection.\n\nHenry saw her distress, and not to increase it, left the room. He had\nexerted himself to turn her thoughts into a new channel, and had\nsucceeded; she thought of him till she began to chide herself for\ndefrauding the dead, and, determining to grieve for Ann, she dwelt on\nHenry's misfortunes and ill health; and the interest he took in her fate\nwas a balm to her sick mind. She did not reason on the subject; but she\nfelt he was attached to her: lost in this delirium, she never asked\nherself what kind of an affection she had for him, or what it tended to;\nnor did she know that love and friendship are very distinct; she thought\nwith rapture, that there was one person in the world who had an\naffection for her, and that person she admired--had a friendship for.\n\nHe had called her his dear girl; the words might have fallen from him by\naccident; but they did not fall to the ground. My child! His child,\nwhat an association of ideas! If I had had a father, such a father!--She\ncould not dwell on the thoughts, the wishes which obtruded themselves.\nHer mind was unhinged, and passion unperceived filled her whole soul.\nLost, in waking dreams, she considered and reconsidered Henry's account\nof himself; till she actually thought she would tell Ann--a bitter\nrecollection then roused her out of her reverie; and aloud she begged\nforgiveness of her.\n\nBy these kind of conflicts the day was lengthened; and when she went to\nbed, the night passed away in feverish slumbers; though they did not\nrefresh her, she was spared the labour of thinking, of restraining her\nimagination; it sported uncontrouled; but took its colour from her\nwaking train of thoughts. One instant she was supporting her dying\nmother; then Ann was breathing her last, and Henry was comforting her.\n\nThe unwelcome light visited her languid eyes; yet, I must tell the\ntruth, she thought she should see Henry, and this hope set her spirits\nin motion: but they were quickly depressed by her maid, who came to tell\nher that she had heard of a vessel on board of which she could be\naccommodated, and that there was to be another female passenger on\nboard, a vulgar one; but perhaps she would be more useful on that\naccount--Mary did not want a companion.\n\nAs she had given orders for her passage to be engaged in the first\nvessel that sailed, she could not now retract; and must prepare for the\nlonely voyage, as the Captain intended taking advantage of the first\nfair wind. She had too much strength of mind to waver in her\ndetermination but to determine wrung her very heart, opened all her old\nwounds, and made them bleed afresh. What was she to do? where go? Could\nshe set a seal to a hasty vow, and tell a deliberate lie; promise to\nlove one man, when the image of another was ever present to her--her\nsoul revolted. \"I might gain the applause of the world by such mock\nheroism; but should I not forfeit my own? forfeit thine, my father!\"\n\nThere is a solemnity in the shortest ejaculation, which, for a while,\nstills the tumult of passion. Mary's mind had been thrown off its poise;\nher devotion had been, perhaps, more fervent for some time past; but\nless regular. She forgot that happiness was not to be found on earth,\nand built a terrestrial paradise liable to be destroyed by the first\nserious thought: when, she reasoned she became inexpressibly sad, to\nrender life bearable she gave way to fancy--this was madness.\n\nIn a few days she must again go to sea; the weather was very\ntempestuous--what of that, the tempest in her soul rendered every other\ntrifling--it was not the contending elements, but _herself_ she feared!\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVII.\n\n\nIn order to gain strength to support the expected interview, she went\nout in a carriage. The day was fine; but all nature was to her a\nuniversal blank; she could neither enjoy it, nor weep that she could\nnot. She passed by the ruins of an old monastery on a very high hill she\ngot out to walk amongst the ruins; the wind blew violently, she did not\navoid its fury, on the contrary, wildly bid it blow on, and seemed glad\nto contend with it, or rather walk against it. Exhausted she returned to\nthe carriage was soon at home, and in the old room.\n\nHenry started at the sight of her altered appearance; the day before her\ncomplexion had been of the most pallid hue; but now her cheeks were\nflushed, and her eyes enlivened with a false vivacity, an unusual fire.\nHe was not well, his illness was apparent in his countenance, and he\nowned he had not closed his eyes all night; this roused her dormant\ntenderness, she forgot they were so soon to part-engrossed by the\npresent happiness of seeing, of hearing him.\n\nOnce or twice she essayed to tell him that she was, in a few days, to\ndepart; but she could not; she was irresolute; it will do to-morrow;\nshould the wind change they could not sail in such a hurry; thus she\nthought, and insensibly grew more calm. The Ladies prevailed on her to\nspend the evening with them; but she retired very early to rest, and sat\non the side of her bed several hours, then threw herself on it, and\nwaited for the dreaded to-morrow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVIII.\n\n\nThe ladies heard that her servant was to be married that day, and that\nshe was to sail in the vessel which was then clearing out at the\nCustom-house. Henry heard, but did not make any remarks; and Mary called\nup all her fortitude to support her, and enable her to hide from the\nfemales her internal struggles. She durst not encounter Henry's glances\nwhen she found he had been informed of her intention; and, trying to\ndraw a veil over her wretched state of mind, she talked incessantly, she\nknew not what; flashes of wit burst from her, and when she began to\nlaugh she could not stop herself.\n\nHenry smiled at some of her sallies, and looked at her with such\nbenignity and compassion, that he recalled her scattered thoughts; and,\nthe ladies going to dress for dinner, they were left alone; and remained\nsilent a few moments: after the noisy conversation it appeared solemn.\nHenry began. \"You are going, Mary, and going by yourself; your mind is\nnot in a state to be left to its own operations--yet I cannot, dissuade\nyou; if I attempted to do it, I should ill deserve the title I wish to\nmerit. I only think of your happiness; could I obey the strongest\nimpulse of my heart, I should accompany thee to England; but such a step\nmight endanger your future peace.\"\n\nMary, then, with all the frankness which marked her character, explained\nher situation to him and mentioned her fatal tie with such disgust that\nhe trembled for her. \"I cannot see him; he is not the man formed for me\nto love!\" Her delicacy did not restrain her, for her dislike to her\nhusband had taken root in her mind long before she knew Henry. Did she\nnot fix on Lisbon rather than France on purpose to avoid him? and if Ann\nhad been in tolerable health she would have flown with her to some\nremote corner to have escaped from him.\n\n\"I intend,\" said Henry, \"to follow you in the next packet; where shall I\nhear of your health?\" \"Oh! let me hear of thine,\" replied Mary. \"I am\nwell, very well; but thou art very ill--thy health is in the most\nprecarious state.\" She then mentioned her intention of going to Ann's\nrelations. \"I am her representative, I have duties to fulfil for her:\nduring my voyage I have time enough for reflection; though I think I\nhave already determined.\"\n\n\"Be not too hasty, my child,\" interrupted Henry; \"far be it from me to\npersuade thee to do violence to thy feelings--but consider that all thy\nfuture life may probably take its colour from thy present mode of\nconduct. Our affections as well as our sentiments are fluctuating; you\nwill not perhaps always either think or feel as you do at present: the\nobject you now shun may appear in a different light.\" He paused. \"In\nadvising thee in this style, I have only thy good at heart, Mary.\"\n\nShe only answered to expostulate. \"My affections are involuntary--yet\nthey can only be fixed by reflection, and when they are they make quite\na part of my soul, are interwoven in it, animate my actions, and form\nmy taste: certain qualities are calculated to call forth my sympathies,\nand make me all I am capable of being. The governing affection gives its\nstamp to the rest--because I am capable of loving one, I have that kind\nof charity to all my fellow-creatures which is not easily provoked.\nMilton has asserted, That earthly love is the scale by which to heavenly\nwe may ascend.\"\n\nShe went on with eagerness. \"My opinions on some subjects are not\nwavering; my pursuit through life has ever been the same: in solitude\nwere my sentiments formed; they are indelible, and nothing can efface\nthem but death--No, death itself cannot efface them, or my soul must be\ncreated afresh, and not improved. Yet a little while am I parted from\nmy Ann--I could not exist without the hope of seeing her again--I could\nnot bear to think that time could wear away an affection that was\nfounded on what is not liable to perish; you might as well attempt to\npersuade me that my soul is matter, and that its feelings arose from\ncertain modifications of it.\"\n\n\"Dear enthusiastic creature,\" whispered Henry, \"how you steal into my\nsoul.\" She still continued. \"The same turn of mind which leads me to\nadore the Author of all Perfection--which leads me to conclude that he\nonly can fill my soul; forces me to admire the faint image-the shadows\nof his attributes here below; and my imagination gives still bolder\nstrokes to them. I knew I am in some degree under the influence of a\ndelusion--but does not this strong delusion prove that I myself 'am _of\nsubtiler essence than the trodden clod_' these flights of the\nimagination point to futurity; I cannot banish them. Every cause in\nnature produces an effect; and am I an exception to the general rule?\nhave I desires implanted in me only to make me miserable? will they\nnever be gratified? shall I never be happy? My feelings do not accord\nwith the notion of solitary happiness. In a state of bliss, it will be\nthe society of beings we can love, without the alloy that earthly\ninfirmities mix with our best affections, that will constitute great\npart of our happiness.\n\n\"With these notions can I conform to the maxims of worldly wisdom? can\nI listen to the cold dictates of worldly prudence and bid my tumultuous\npassions cease to vex me, be still, find content in grovelling pursuits,\nand the admiration of the misjudging crowd, when it is only one I wish\nto please--one who could be all the world to me. Argue not with me, I am\nbound by human ties; but did my spirit ever promise to love, or could I\nconsider when forced to bind myself--to take a vow, that at the awful\nday of judgment I must give an account of. My conscience does not smite\nme, and that Being who is greater than the internal monitor, may approve\nof what the world condemns; sensible that in Him I live, could I brave\nHis presence, or hope in solitude to find peace, if I acted contrary to\nconviction, that the world might approve of my conduct--what could the\nworld give to compensate for my own esteem? it is ever hostile and armed\nagainst the feeling heart!\n\n\"Riches and honours await me, and the cold moralist might desire me to\nsit down and enjoy them--I cannot conquer my feelings, and till I do,\nwhat are these baubles to me? you may tell me I follow a fleeting good,\nan _ignis fatuus_; but this chase, these struggles prepare me for\neternity--when I no longer see through a glass darkly I shall not reason\nabout, but _feel_ in what happiness consists.\"\n\nHenry had not attempted to interrupt her; he saw she was determined, and\nthat these sentiments were not the effusion of the moment, but well\ndigested ones, the result of strong affections, a high sense of honour,\nand respect for the source of all virtue and truth. He was startled, if\nnot entirely convinced by her arguments; indeed her voice, her gestures\nwere all persuasive.\n\nSome one now entered the room; he looked an answer to her long harangue;\nit was fortunate for him, or he might have been led to say what in a\ncooler moment he had determined to conceal; but were words necessary to\nreveal it? He wished not to influence her conduct--vain precaution; she\nknew she was beloved; and could she forget that such a man loved her, or\nrest satisfied with any inferior gratification. When passion first\nenters the heart, it is only a return of affection that is sought after,\nand every other remembrance and wish is blotted out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIX.\n\n\nTwo days passed away without any particular conversation; Henry, trying\nto be indifferent, or to appear so, was more assiduous than ever. The\nconflict was too violent for his present state of health; the spirit was\nwilling, but the body suffered; he lost his appetite, and looked\nwretchedly; his spirits were calmly low--the world seemed to fade\naway--what was that world to him that Mary did not inhabit; she lived\nnot for him.\n\nHe was mistaken; his affection was her only support; without this dear\nprop she had sunk into the grave of her lost--long-loved friend;--his\nattention snatched her from despair. Inscrutable are the ways of\nHeaven!\n\nThe third day Mary was desired to prepare herself; for if the wind\ncontinued in the same point, they should set sail the next evening. She\ntried to prepare her mind, and her efforts were not useless she appeared\nless agitated than could have been expected, and talked of her voyage\nwith composure. On great occasions she was generally calm and collected,\nher resolution would brace her unstrung nerves; but after the victory\nshe had no triumph; she would sink into a state of moping melancholy,\nand feel ten-fold misery when the heroic enthusiasm was over.\n\nThe morning of the day fixed on for her departure she was alone with\nHenry only a few moments, and an awkward kind of formality made them\nslip away without their having said much to each other. Henry was\nafraid to discover his passion, or give any other name to his regard but\nfriendship; yet his anxious solicitude for her welfare was ever breaking\nout-while she as artlessly expressed again and again, her fears with\nrespect to his declining health.\n\n\"We shall soon meet,\" said he, with a faint smile; Mary smiled too; she\ncaught the sickly beam; it was still fainter by being reflected, and not\nknowing what she wished to do, started up and left the room. When she\nwas alone she regretted she had left him so precipitately. \"The few\nprecious moments I have thus thrown away may never return,\" she\nthought-the reflection led to misery.\n\nShe waited for, nay, almost wished for the summons to depart. She could\nnot avoid spending the intermediate time with the ladies and Henry; and\nthe trivial conversations she was obliged to bear a part in harassed her\nmore than can be well conceived.\n\nThe summons came, and the whole party attended her to the vessel. For a\nwhile the remembrance of Ann banished her regret at parting with Henry,\nthough his pale figure pressed on her sight; it may seem a paradox, but\nhe was more present to her when she sailed; her tears then were all his\nown.\n\n\"My poor Ann!\" thought Mary, \"along this road we came, and near this\nspot you called me your guardian angel--and now I leave thee here! ah!\nno, I do not--thy spirit is not confined to its mouldering tenement!\nTell me, thou soul of her I love, tell me, ah! whither art thou fled?\"\nAnn occupied her until they reached the ship.\n\nThe anchor was weighed. Nothing can be more irksome than waiting to say\nfarewel. As the day was serene, they accompanied her a little way, and\nthen got into the boat; Henry was the last; he pressed her hand, it had\nnot any life in it; she leaned over the side of the ship without looking\nat the boat, till it was so far distant, that she could not see the\ncountenances of those that were in it: a mist spread itself over her\nsight--she longed to exchange one look--tried to recollect the\nlast;--the universe contained no being but Henry!--The grief of parting\nwith him had swept all others clean away. Her eyes followed the keel of\nthe boat, and when she could no longer perceive its traces: she looked\nround on the wide waste of waters, thought of the precious moments\nwhich had been stolen from the waste of murdered time.\n\nShe then descended into the cabin, regardless of the surrounding\nbeauties of nature, and throwing herself on her bed in the little hole\nwhich was called the state-room--she wished to forget her existence. On\nthis bed she remained two days, listening to the dashing waves, unable\nto close her eyes. A small taper made the darkness visible; and the\nthird night, by its glimmering light, she wrote the following fragment.\n\n\"Poor solitary wretch that I am; here alone do I listen to the whistling\nwinds and dashing waves;--on no human support can I rest--when not lost\nto hope I found pleasure in the society of those rough beings; but now\nthey appear not like my fellow creatures; no social ties draw me to\nthem. How long, how dreary has this day been; yet I scarcely wish it\nover--for what will to-morrow bring--to-morrow, and to-morrow will only\nbe marked with unvaried characters of wretchedness.--Yet surely, I am\nnot alone!\"\n\nHer moistened eyes were lifted up to heaven; a crowd of thoughts darted\ninto her mind, and pressing her hand against her forehead, as if to bear\nthe intellectual weight, she tried, but tried in vain, to arrange them.\n\"Father of Mercies, compose this troubled spirit: do I indeed wish it to\nbe composed--to forget my Henry?\" the _my_, the pen was directly drawn\nacross in an agony.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XX.\n\n\nThe mate of the ship, who heard her stir, came to offer her some\nrefreshment; and she, who formerly received every offer of kindness or\ncivility with pleasure, now shrunk away disgusted: peevishly she desired\nhim not to disturb her; but the words were hardly articulated when her\nheart smote her, she called him back, and requested something to drink.\nAfter drinking it, fatigued by her mental exertions, she fell into a\ndeath-like slumber, which lasted some hours; but did not refresh her, on\nthe contrary, she awoke languid and stupid.\n\nThe wind still continued contrary; a week, a dismal week, had she\nstruggled with her sorrows; and the struggle brought on a slow fever,\nwhich sometimes gave her false spirits.\n\nThe winds then became very tempestuous, the Great Deep was troubled, and\nall the passengers appalled. Mary then left her bed, and went on deck,\nto survey the contending elements: the scene accorded with the present\nstate of her soul; she thought in a few hours I may go home; the\nprisoner may be released. The vessel rose on a wave and descended into a\nyawning gulph--Not slower did her mounting soul return to earth,\nfor--Ah! her treasure and her heart was there. The squalls rattled\namongst the sails, which were quickly taken down; the wind would then\ndie away, and the wild undirected waves rushed on every side with a\ntremendous roar. In a little vessel in the midst of such a storm she\nwas not dismayed; she felt herself independent.\n\nJust then one of the crew perceived a signal of distress; by the help of\na glass he could plainly discover a small vessel dismasted, drifted\nabout, for the rudder had been broken by the violence of the storm.\nMary's thoughts were now all engrossed by the crew on the brink of\ndestruction. They bore down to the wreck; they reached it, and hailed\nthe trembling wretches; at the sound of the friendly greeting, loud\ncries of tumultuous joy were mixed with the roaring of the waves, and\nwith ecstatic transport they leaped on the shattered deck, launched\ntheir boat in a moment, and committed themselves to the mercy of the\nsea. Stowed between two casks, and leaning on a sail, she watched the\nboat, and when a wave intercepted it from her view--she ceased to\nbreathe, or rather held her breath until it rose again.\n\nAt last the boat arrived safe along-side the ship, and Mary caught the\npoor trembling wretches as they stumbled into it, and joined them in\nthanking that gracious Being, who though He had not thought fit to still\nthe raging of the sea, had afforded them unexpected succour.\n\nAmongst the wretched crew was one poor woman, who fainted when she was\nhauled on board: Mary undressed her, and when she had recovered, and\nsoothed her, left her to enjoy the rest she required to recruit her\nstrength, which fear had quite exhausted. She returned again to view the\nangry deep; and when she gazed on its perturbed state, she thought of\nthe Being who rode on the wings of the wind, and stilled the noise of\nthe sea; and the madness of the people--He only could speak peace to\nher troubled spirit! she grew more calm; the late transaction had\ngratified her benevolence, and stole her out of herself.\n\nOne of the sailors, happening to say to another, \"that he believed the\nworld was going to be at an end;\" this observation led her into a new\ntrain of thoughts: some of Handel's sublime compositions occurred to\nher, and she sung them to the grand accompaniment. The Lord God\nOmnipotent reigned, and would reign for ever, and ever!--Why then did\nshe fear the sorrows that were passing away, when she knew that He would\nbind up the broken-hearted, and receive those who came out of great\ntribulation. She retired to her cabin; and wrote in the little book that\nwas now her only confident. It was after midnight.\n\n\"At this solemn hour, the great day of judgment fills my thoughts; the\nday of retribution, when the secrets of all hearts will be revealed;\nwhen all worldly distinctions will fade away, and be no more seen. I\nhave not words to express the sublime images which the bare\ncontemplation of this awful day raises in my mind. Then, indeed, the\nLord Omnipotent will reign, and He will wipe the tearful eye, and\nsupport the trembling heart--yet a little while He hideth his face, and\nthe dun shades of sorrow, and the thick clouds of folly separate us from\nour God; but when the glad dawn of an eternal day breaks, we shall know\neven as we are known. Here we walk by faith, and not by sight; and we\nhave this alternative, either to enjoy the pleasures of life which are\nbut for a season, or look forward to the prize of our high calling, and\nwith fortitude, and that wisdom which is from above, endeavour to bear\nthe warfare of life. We know that many run the race; but he that\nstriveth obtaineth the crown of victory. Our race is an arduous one! How\nmany are betrayed by traitors lodged in their own breasts, who wear the\ngarb of Virtue, and are so near akin; we sigh to think they should ever\nlead into folly, and slide imperceptibly into vice. Surely any thing\nlike happiness is madness! Shall probationers of an hour presume to\npluck the fruit of immortality, before they have conquered death? it is\nguarded, when the great day, to which I allude, arrives, the way will\nagain be opened. Ye dear delusions, gay deceits, farewel! and yet I\ncannot banish ye for ever; still does my panting soul push forward, and\nlive in futurity, in the deep shades o'er which darkness hangs.--I try\nto pierce the gloom, and find a resting-place, where my thirst of\nknowledge will be gratified, and my ardent affections find an object to\nfix them. Every thing material must change; happiness and this\nfluctating principle is not compatible. Eternity, immateriality, and\nhappiness,--what are ye? How shall I grasp the mighty and fleeting\nconceptions ye create?\"\n\nAfter writing, serenely she delivered her soul into the hands of the\nFather of Spirits; and slept in peace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXI.\n\n\nMary rose early, refreshed by the seasonable rest, and went to visit the\npoor woman, whom she found quite recovered: and, on enquiry, heard that\nshe had lately buried her husband, a common sailor; and that her only\nsurviving child had been washed over-board the day before. Full of her\nown danger, she scarcely thought of her child till that was over; and\nthen she gave way to boisterous emotions.\n\nMary endeavoured to calm her at first, by sympathizing with her; and she\ntried to point out the only solid source of comfort but in doing this\nshe encountered many difficulties; she found her grossly ignorant, yet\nshe did not despair: and as the poor creature could not receive comfort\nfrom the operations of her own mind, she laboured to beguile the hours,\nwhich grief made heavy, by adapting her conversation to her capacity.\n\nThere are many minds that only receive impressions through the medium of\nthe senses: to them did Mary address herself; she made her some\npresents, and promised to assist her when they should arrive in England.\nThis employment roused her out of her late stupor, and again set the\nfaculties of her soul in motion; made the understanding contend with the\nimagination, and the heart throbbed not so irregularly during the\ncontention. How short-lived was the calm! when the English coast was\ndescried, her sorrows returned with redoubled vigor.--She was to visit\nand comfort the mother of her lost friend--And where then should she\ntake up her residence? These thoughts suspended the exertions of her\nunderstanding; abstracted reflections gave way to alarming\napprehensions; and tenderness undermined fortitude.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXII.\n\n\nIn England then landed the forlorn wanderer. She looked round for some\nfew moments--her affections were not attracted to any particular part of\nthe Island. She knew none of the inhabitants of the vast city to which\nshe was going: the mass of buildings appeared to her a huge body without\nan informing soul. As she passed through the streets in an\nhackney-coach, disgust and horror alternately filled her mind. She met\nsome women drunk; and the manners of those who attacked the sailors,\nmade her shrink into herself, and exclaim, are these my fellow\ncreatures!\n\nDetained by a number of carts near the water-side, for she came up the\nriver in the vessel, not having reason to hasten on shore, she saw\nvulgarity, dirt, and vice--her soul sickened; this was the first time\nsuch complicated misery obtruded itself on her sight.--Forgetting her\nown griefs, she gave the world a much indebted tear; mourned for a world\nin ruins. She then perceived, that great part of her comfort must arise\nfrom viewing the smiling face of nature, and be reflected from the view\nof innocent enjoyments: she was fond of seeing animals play, and could\nnot bear to see her own species sink below them.\n\nIn a little dwelling in one of the villages near London, lived the\nmother of Ann; two of her children still remained with her; but they did\nnot resemble Ann. To her house Mary directed the coach, and told the\nunfortunate mother of her loss. The poor woman, oppressed by it, and her\nmany other cares, after an inundation of tears, began to enumerate all\nher past misfortunes, and present cares. The heavy tale lasted until\nmidnight, and the impression it made on Mary's mind was so strong, that\nit banished sleep till towards morning; when tired nature sought\nforgetfulness, and the soul ceased to ruminate about many things.\n\nShe sent for the poor woman they took up at sea, provided her a lodging,\nand relieved her present necessities. A few days were spent in a kind of\nlistless way; then the mother of Ann began to enquire when she thought\nof returning home. She had hitherto treated her with the greatest\nrespect, and concealed her wonder at Mary's choosing a remote room in\nthe house near the garden, and ordering some alterations to be made, as\nif she intended living in it.\n\nMary did not choose to explain herself; had Ann lived, it is probable\nshe would never have loved Henry so fondly; but if she had, she could\nnot have talked of her passion to any human creature. She deliberated,\nand at last informed the family, that she had a reason for not living\nwith her husband, which must some time remain a secret--they stared--Not\nlive with him! how will you live then? This was a question she could not\nanswer; she had only about eighty pounds remaining, of the money she\ntook with her to Lisbon; when it was exhausted where could she get more?\nI will work, she cried, do any thing rather than be a slave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIII.\n\n\nUnhappy, she wandered about the village, and relieved the poor; it was\nthe only employment that eased her aching heart; she became more\nintimate with misery--the misery that rises from poverty and the want of\neducation. She was in the vicinity of a great city; the vicious poor in\nand about it must ever grieve a benevolent contemplative mind.\n\nOne evening a man who stood weeping in a little lane, near the house she\nresided in, caught her eye. She accosted him; in a confused manner, he\ninformed her, that his wife was dying, and his children crying for the\nbread he could not earn. Mary desired to be conducted to his\nhabitation; it was not very distant, and was the upper room in an old\nmansion-house, which had been once the abode of luxury. Some tattered\nshreds of rich hangings still remained, covered with cobwebs and filth;\nround the ceiling, through which the rain drop'd, was a beautiful\ncornice mouldering; and a spacious gallery was rendered dark by the\nbroken windows being blocked up; through the apertures the wind forced\nits way in hollow sounds, and reverberated along the former scene of\nfestivity.\n\nIt was crowded with inhabitants: som were scolding, others swearing, or\nsinging indecent songs. What a sight for Mary! Her blood ran cold; yet\nshe had sufficient resolution to mount to the top of the house. On the\nfloor, in one corner of a very small room, lay an emaciated figure of a\nwoman; a window over her head scarcely admitted any light, for the\nbroken panes were stuffed with dirty rags. Near her were five children,\nall young, and covered with dirt; their sallow cheeks, and languid eyes,\nexhibited none of the charms of childhood. Some were fighting, and\nothers crying for food; their yells were mixed with their mother's\ngroans, and the wind which rushed through the passage. Mary was\npetrified; but soon assuming more courage, approached the bed, and,\nregardless of the surrounding nastiness, knelt down by the poor wretch,\nand breathed the most poisonous air; for the unfortunate creature was\ndying of a putrid fever, the consequence of dirt and want.\n\nTheir state did not require much explanation. Mary sent the husband for\na poor neighbour, whom she hired to nurse the woman, and take care of\nthe children; and then went herself to buy them some necessaries at a\nshop not far distant. Her knowledge of physic had enabled her to\nprescribe for the woman; and she left the house, with a mixture of\nhorror and satisfaction.\n\nShe visited them every day, and procured them every comfort; contrary to\nher expectation, the woman began to recover; cleanliness and wholesome\nfood had a wonderful effect; and Mary saw her rising as it were from the\ngrave. Not aware of the danger she ran into, she did not think of it\ntill she perceived she had caught the fever. It made such an alarming\nprogress, that she was prevailed on to send for a physician; but the\ndisorder was so violent, that for some days it baffled his skill; and\nMary felt not her danger, as she was delirious. After the crisis, the\nsymptoms were more favourable, and she slowly recovered, without\nregaining much strength or spirits; indeed they were intolerably low:\nshe wanted a tender nurse.\n\nFor some time she had observed, that she was not treated with the same\nrespect as formerly; her favors were forgotten when no more were\nexpected. This ingratitude hurt her, as did a similar instance in the\nwoman who came out of the ship. Mary had hitherto supported her; as her\nfinances were growing low, she hinted to her, that she ought to try to\nearn her own subsistence: the woman in return loaded her with abuse.\n\nTwo months were elapsed; she had not seen, or heard from Henry. He was\nsick--nay, perhaps had forgotten her; all the world was dreary, and all\nthe people ungrateful.\n\nShe sunk into apathy, and endeavouring to rouse herself out of it, she\nwrote in her book another fragment:\n\n\"Surely life is a dream, a frightful one! and after those rude,\ndisjointed images are fled, will light ever break in? Shall I ever feel\njoy? Do all suffer like me; or am I framed so as to be particularly\nsusceptible of misery? It is true, I have experienced the most rapturous\nemotions--short-lived delight!--ethereal beam, which only serves to shew\nmy present misery--yet lie still, my throbbing heart, or burst; and my\nbrain--why dost thou whirl about at such a terrifying rate? why do\nthoughts so rapidly rush into my mind, and yet when they disappear\nleave such deep traces? I could almost wish for the madman's happiness,\nand in a strong imagination lose a sense of woe.\n\n\"Oh! reason, thou boasted guide, why desert me, like the world, when I\nmost need thy assistance! Canst thou not calm this internal tumult, and\ndrive away the death-like sadness which presses so sorely on me,--a\nsadness surely very nearly allied to despair. I am now the prey of\napathy--I could wish for the former storms! a ray of hope sometimes\nillumined my path; I had a pursuit; but now _it visits not my haunts\nforlorn_. Too well have I loved my fellow creatures! I have been wounded\nby ingratitude; from every one it has something of the serpent's tooth.\n\n\"When overwhelmed by sorrow, I have met unkindness; I looked for some\none to have pity on me; but found none!--The healing balm of sympathy is\ndenied; I weep, a solitary wretch, and the hot tears scald my cheeks. I\nhave not the medicine of life, the dear chimera I have so often chased,\na friend. Shade of my loved Ann! dost thou ever visit thy poor Mary?\nRefined spirit, thou wouldst weep, could angels weep, to see her\nstruggling with passions she cannot subdue; and feelings which corrode\nher small portion of comfort!\"\n\nShe could not write any more; she wished herself far distant from all\nhuman society; a thick gloom spread itself over her mind: but did not\nmake her forget the very beings she wished to fly from. She sent for the\npoor woman she found in the garret; gave her money to clothe herself\nand children, and buy some furniture for a little hut, in a large\ngarden, the master of which agreed to employ her husband, who had been\nbred a gardener. Mary promised to visit the family, and see their new\nabode when she was able to go out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIV.\n\n\nMary still continued weak and low, though it was spring, and all nature\nbegan to look gay; with more than usual brightness the sun shone, and a\nlittle robin which she had cherished during the winter sung one of his\nbest songs. The family were particularly civil this fine morning, and\ntried to prevail on her to walk out. Any thing like kindness melted her;\nshe consented.\n\nSofter emotions banished her melancholy, and she directed her steps to\nthe habitation she had rendered comfortable.\n\nEmerging out of a dreary chamber, all nature looked cheerful; when she\nhad last walked out, snow covered the ground, and bleak winds pierced\nher through and through: now the hedges were green, the blossoms adorned\nthe trees, and the birds sung. She reached the dwelling, without being\nmuch exhausted and while she rested there, observed the children\nsporting on the grass, with improved complexions. The mother with tears\nthanked her deliverer, and pointed out her comforts. Mary's tears flowed\nnot only from sympathy, but a complication of feelings and recollections\nthe affections which bound her to her fellow creatures began again to\nplay, and reanimated nature. She observed the change in herself, tried\nto account for it, and wrote with her pencil a rhapsody on sensibility.\n\n\"Sensibility is the most exquisite feeling of which the human soul is\nsusceptible: when it pervades us, we feel happy; and could it last\nunmixed, we might form some conjecture of the bliss of those\nparadisiacal days, when the obedient passions were under the dominion of\nreason, and the impulses of the heart did not need correction.\n\n\"It is this quickness, this delicacy of feeling, which enables us to\nrelish the sublime touches of the poet, and the painter; it is this,\nwhich expands the soul, gives an enthusiastic greatness, mixed with\ntenderness, when we view the magnificent objects of nature; or hear of a\ngood action. The same effect we experience in the spring, when we hail\nthe returning sun, and the consequent renovation of nature; when the\nflowers unfold themselves, and exhale their sweets, and the voice of\nmusic is heard in the land. Softened by tenderness; the soul is\ndisposed to be virtuous. Is any sensual gratification to be compared to\nthat of feelings the eves moistened after having comforted the\nunfortunate?\n\n\"Sensibility is indeed the foundation of all our happiness; but these\nraptures are unknown to the depraved sensualist, who is only moved by\nwhat strikes his gross senses; the delicate embellishments of nature\nescape his notice; as do the gentle and interesting affections.--But it\nis only to be felt; it escapes discussion.\"\n\nShe then returned home, and partook of the family meal, which was\nrendered more cheerful by the presence of a man, past the meridian of\nlife, of polished manners, and dazzling wit. He endeavoured to draw Mary\nout, and succeeded; she entered into conversation, and some of her\nartless flights of genius struck him with surprise; he found she had a\ncapacious mind, and that her reason was as profound as her imagination\nwas lively. She glanced from earth to heaven, and caught the light of\ntruth. Her expressive countenance shewed what passed in her mind, and\nher tongue was ever the faithful interpreter of her heart; duplicity\nnever threw a shade over her words or actions. Mary found him a man of\nlearning; and the exercise of her understanding would frequently make\nher forget her griefs, when nothing else could, except benevolence.\n\nThis man had known the mistress of the house in her youth; good nature\ninduced him to visit her; but when he saw Mary he had another\ninducement. Her appearance, and above all, her genius, and cultivation\nof mind, roused his curiosity; but her dignified manners had such an\neffect on him, he was obliged to suppress it. He knew men, as well as\nbooks; his conversation was entertaining and improving. In Mary's\ncompany he doubted whether heaven was peopled with spirits masculine;\nand almost forgot that he had called the sex \"the pretty play things\nthat render life tolerable.\"\n\nHe had been the slave of beauty, the captive of sense; love he ne'er had\nfelt; the mind never rivetted the chain, nor had the purity of it made\nthe body appear lovely in his eyes. He was humane, despised meanness;\nbut was vain of his abilities, and by no means a useful member of\nsociety. He talked often of the beauty of virtue; but not having any\nsolid foundation to build the practice on, he was only a shining, or\nrather a sparkling character: and though his fortune enabled him to\nhunt down pleasure, he was discontented.\n\nMary observed his character, and wrote down a train of reflections,\nwhich these observations led her to make; these reflections received a\ntinge from her mind; the present state of it, was that kind of painful\nquietness which arises from reason clouded by disgust; she had not yet\nlearned to be resigned; vague hopes agitated her.\n\n\"There are some subjects that are so enveloped in clouds, as you\ndissipate one, another overspreads it. Of this kind are our reasonings\nconcerning happiness; till we are obliged to cry out with the Apostle,\n_That it hath not entered into the heart of man to conceive in what it\ncould consist_, or how satiety could be prevented. Man seems formed for\naction, though the passions are seldom properly managed; they are\neither so languid as not to serve as a spur, or else so violent, as to\noverleap all bounds.\n\n\"Every individual has its own peculiar trials; and anguish, in one shape\nor other, visits every heart. Sensibility produces flights of virtue;\nand not curbed by reason, is on the brink of vice talking, and even\nthinking of virtue.\n\n\"Christianity can only afford just principles to govern the wayward\nfeelings and impulses of the heart: every good disposition runs wild, if\nnot transplanted into this soil; but how hard is it to keep the heart\ndiligently, though convinced that the issues of life depend on it.\n\n\"It is very difficult to discipline the mind of a thinker, or reconcile\nhim to the weakness, the inconsistency of his understanding; and a\nstill more laborious task for him to conquer his passions, and learn to\nseek content, instead of happiness. Good dispositions, and virtuous\npropensities, without the light of the Gospel, produce eccentric\ncharacters: comet-like, they are always in extremes; while revelation\nresembles the laws of attraction, and produces uniformity; but too often\nis the attraction feeble; and the light so obscured by passion, as to\nforce the bewildered soul to fly into void space, and wander in\nconfusion.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXV.\n\n\nA few mornings after, as Mary was sitting ruminating, harassed by\nperplexing thoughts, and fears, a letter was delivered to her: the\nservant waited for an answer. Her heart palpitated; it was from Henry;\nshe held it some time in her hand, then tore it open; it was not a long\none; and only contained an account of a relapse, which prevented his\nsailing in the first packet, as he had intended. Some tender enquiries\nwere added, concerning her health, and state of mind; but they were\nexpressed in rather a formal style: it vexed her, and the more so, as it\nstopped the current of affection, which the account of his arrival and\nillness had made flow to her heart--it ceased to beat for a moment--she\nread the passage over again; but could not tell what she was hurt\nby--only that it did not answer the expectations of her affection. She\nwrote a laconic, incoherent note in return, allowing him to call on her\nthe next day--he had requested permission at the conclusion of his\nletter.\n\nHer mind was then painfully active; she could not read or walk; she\ntried to fly from herself, to forget the long hours that were yet to run\nbefore to-morrow could arrive: she knew not what time he would come;\ncertainly in the morning, she concluded; the morning then was anxiously\nwished for; and every wish produced a sigh, that arose from expectation\non the stretch, damped by fear and vain regret.\n\nTo beguile the tedious time, Henry's favorite tunes were sung; the books\nthey read together turned over; and the short epistle read at least a\nhundred times.--Any one who had seen her, would have supposed that she\nwas trying to decypher Chinese characters.\n\nAfter a sleepless night, she hailed the tardy day, watched the rising\nsun, and then listened for every footstep, and started if she heard the\nstreet door opened. At last he came, and she who had been counting the\nhours, and doubting whether the earth moved, would gladly have escaped\nthe approaching interview.\n\nWith an unequal, irresolute pace, she went to meet him; but when she\nbeheld his emaciated countenance, all the tenderness, which the\nformality of his letter had damped, returned, and a mournful\npresentiment stilled the internal conflict. She caught his hand, and\nlooking wistfully at him, exclaimed, \"Indeed, you are not well!\"\n\n\"I am very far from well; but it matters not,\" added he with a smile of\nresignation; \"my native air may work wonders, and besides, my mother is\na tender nurse, and I shall sometimes see thee.\"\n\nMary felt for the first time in her life, envy; she wished\ninvoluntarily, that all the comfort he received should be from her. She\nenquired about the symptoms of his disorder; and heard that he had been\nvery ill; she hastily drove away the fears, that former dear bought\nexperience suggested: and again and again did she repeat, that she was\nsure he would soon recover. She would then look in his face, to see if\nhe assented, and ask more questions to the same purport. She tried to\navoid speaking of herself, and Henry left her, with, a promise of\nvisiting her the next day.\n\nHer mind was now engrossed by one fear--yet she would not allow herself\nto think that she feared an event she could not name. She still saw his\npale face; the sound of his voice still vibrated on her ears; she tried\nto retain it; she listened, looked round, wept, and prayed.\n\nHenry had enlightened the desolate scene: was this charm of life to fade\naway, and, like the baseless fabric of a vision, leave not a wreck\nbehind? These thoughts disturbed her reason, she shook her head, as if\nto drive them out of it; a weight, a heavy one, was on her heart; all\nwas not well there.\n\nOut of this reverie she was soon woke to keener anguish, by the arrival\nof a letter from her husband; it came to Lisbon after her departure:\nHenry had forwarded it to her, but did not choose to deliver it\nhimself, for a very obvious reason; it might have produced a\nconversation he wished for some time to avoid; and his precaution took\nits rise almost equally from benevolence and love.\n\nShe could not muster up sufficient resolution to break the seal: her\nfears were not prophetic, for the contents gave her comfort. He informed\nher that he intended prolonging his tour, as he was now his own master,\nand wished to remain some time on the continent, and in particular to\nvisit Italy without any restraint: but his reasons for it appeared\nchildish; it was not to cultivate his taste, or tread on classic ground,\nwhere poets and philosophers caught their lore; but to join in the\nmasquerades, and such burlesque amusements.\n\nThese instances of folly relieved Mary, in some degree reconciled her\nto herself added fuel to the devouring flame--and silenced something\nlike a pang, which reason and conscience made her feel, when she\nreflected, that it is the office of Religion to reconcile us to the\nseemingly hard dispensations of providence; and that no inclination,\nhowever strong, should oblige us to desert the post assigned us, or\nforce us to forget that virtue should be an active principle; and that\nthe most desirable station, is the one that exercises our faculties,\nrefines our affections, and enables us to be useful.\n\nOne reflection continually wounded her repose; she feared not poverty;\nher wants were few; but in giving up a fortune, she gave up the power of\ncomforting the miserable, and making the sad heart sing for joy.\n\nHeaven had endowed her with uncommon humanity, to render her one of His\nbenevolent agents, a messenger of peace; and should she attend to her\nown inclinations?\n\nThese suggestions, though they could not subdue a violent passion,\nincreased her misery. One moment she was a heroine, half determined to\nbear whatever fate should inflict; the next, her mind would recoil--and\ntenderness possessed her whole soul. Some instances of Henry's\naffection, his worth and genius, were remembered: and the earth was only\na vale of tears, because he was not to sojourn with her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVI.\n\n\nHenry came the next day, and once or twice in the course of the\nfollowing week; but still Mary kept up some little formality, a certain\nconsciousness restrained her; and Henry did not enter on the subject\nwhich he found she wished to avoid. In the course of conversation,\nhowever, she mentioned to him, that she earnestly desired to obtain a\nplace in one of the public offices for Ann's brother, as the family were\nagain in a declining way.\n\nHenry attended, made a few enquiries, and dropped the subject; but the\nfollowing week, she heard him enter with unusual haste; it was to inform\nher, that he had made interest with a person of some consequence, whom\nhe had once obliged in a very disagreeable exigency, in a foreign\ncountry; and that he had procured a place for her friend, which would\ninfallibly lead to something better, if he behaved with propriety. Mary\ncould not speak to thank him; emotions of gratitude and love suffused\nher face; her blood eloquently spoke. She delighted to receive benefits\nthrough the medium of her fellow creatures; but to receive them from\nHenry was exquisite pleasure.\n\nAs the summer advanced, Henry grew worse; the closeness of the air, in\nthe metropolis, affected his breath; and his mother insisted on his\nfixing on some place in the country, where she would accompany him. He\ncould not think of going far off, but chose a little village on the\nbanks of the Thames, near Mary's dwelling: he then introduced her to his\nmother.\n\nThey frequently went down the river in a boat; Henry would take his\nviolin, and Mary would sometimes sing, or read, to them. She pleased his\nmother; she inchanted him. It was an advantage to Mary that friendship\nfirst possessed her heart; it opened it to all the softer sentiments of\nhumanity:--and when this first affection was torn away, a similar one\nsprung up, with a still tenderer sentiment added to it.\n\nThe last evening they were on the water, the clouds grew suddenly black,\nand broke in violent showers, which interrupted the solemn stillness\nthat had prevailed previous to it. The thunder roared; and the oars\nplying quickly, in order to reach the shore, occasioned a not\nunpleasing sound. Mary drew still nearer Henry; she wished to have\nsought with him a watry grave; to have escaped the horror of surviving\nhim.--She spoke not, but Henry saw the workings of her mind--he felt\nthem; threw his arm round her waist--and they enjoyed the luxury of\nwretchedness.--As they touched the shore, Mary perceived that Henry was\nwet; with eager anxiety she cried, What shall I do!--this day will kill\nthee, and I shall not die with thee!\n\nThis accident put a stop to their pleasurable excursions; it had injured\nhim, and brought on the spitting of blood he was subject to--perhaps it\nwas not the cold that he caught, that occasioned it. In vain did Mary\ntry to shut her eyes; her fate pursued her! Henry every day grew worse\nand worse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVII.\n\n\nOppressed by her foreboding fears, her sore mind was hurt by new\ninstances of ingratitude: disgusted with the family, whose misfortunes\nhad often disturbed her repose, and lost in anticipated sorrow, she\nrambled she knew not where; when turning down a shady walk, she\ndiscovered her feet had taken the path they delighted to tread. She saw\nHenry sitting in his garden alone; he quickly opened the garden-gate,\nand she sat down by him.\n\n\"I did not,\" said he, \"expect to see thee this evening, my dearest Mary;\nbut I was thinking of thee. Heaven has endowed thee with an uncommon\nportion of fortitude, to support one of the most affectionate hearts in\nthe world. This is not a time for disguise; I know I am dear to\nthee--and my affection for thee is twisted with every fibre of my\nheart.--I loved thee ever since I have been acquainted with thine: thou\nart the being my fancy has delighted to form; but which I imagined\nexisted only there! In a little while the shades of death will encompass\nme--ill-fated love perhaps added strength to my disease, and smoothed\nthe rugged path. Try, my love, to fulfil thy destined course--try to add\nto thy other virtues patience. I could have wished, for thy sake, that\nwe could have died together--or that I could live to shield thee from\nthe assaults of an unfeeling world! Could I but offer thee an asylum in\nthese arms--a faithful bosom, in which thou couldst repose all thy\ngriefs--\" He pressed her to it, and she returned the pressure--he felt her\nthrobbing heart. A mournful silence ensued! when he resumed the\nconversation. \"I wished to prepare thee for the blow--too surely do I\nfeel that it will not be long delayed! The passion I have nursed is so\npure, that death cannot extinguish it--or tear away the impression thy\nvirtues have made on my soul. I would fain comfort thee--\"\n\n\"Talk not of comfort,\" interrupted Mary, \"it will be in heaven with thee\nand Ann--while I shall remain on earth the veriest wretch!\"--She grasped\nhis hand.\n\n\"There we shall meet, my love, my Mary, in our Father's--\" His voice\nfaultered; he could not finish the sentence; he was almost\nsuffocated--they both wept, their tears relieved them; they walked\nslowly to the garden-gate (Mary would not go into the house); they could\nnot say farewel when they reached it--and Mary hurried down the lane; to\nspare Henry the pain of witnessing her emotions.\n\nWhen she lost sight of the house she sat down on the ground, till it\ngrew late, thinking of all that had passed. Full of these thoughts, she\ncrept along, regardless of the descending rain; when lifting up her eyes\nto heaven, and then turning them wildly on the prospects around, without\nmarking them; she only felt that the scene accorded with her present\nstate of mind. It was the last glimmering of twilight, with a full moon,\nover which clouds continually flitted. Where am I wandering, God of\nMercy! she thought; she alluded to the wanderings of her mind. In what a\nlabyrinth am I lost! What miseries have I already encountered--and what\na number lie still before me.\n\nHer thoughts flew rapidly to something. I could be happy listening to\nhim, soothing his cares.--Would he not smile upon me--call me his own\nMary? I am not his--said she with fierceness--I am a wretch! and she\nheaved a sigh that almost broke her heart, while the big tears rolled\ndown her burning cheeks; but still her exercised mind, accustomed to\nthink, began to observe its operation, though the barrier of reason was\nalmost carried away, and all the faculties not restrained by her, were\nrunning into confusion. Wherefore am I made thus? Vain are my\nefforts--I cannot live without loving--and love leads to madness.--Yet\nI will not weep; and her eyes were now fixed by despair, dry and\nmotionless; and then quickly whirled about with a look of distraction.\n\nShe looked for hope; but found none--all was troubled waters.--No where\ncould she find rest. I have already paced to and fro in the earth; it is\nnot my abiding place--may I not too go home! Ah! no. Is this complying\nwith my Henry's request, could a spirit thus disengaged expect to\nassociate with his? Tears of tenderness strayed down her relaxed\ncountenance, and her softened heart heaved more regularly. She felt the\nrain, and turned to her solitary home.\n\nFatigued by the tumultuous emotions she had endured, when she entered\nthe house she ran to her own room, sunk on the bed; and exhausted\nnature soon closed her eyes; but active fancy was still awake, and a\nthousand fearful dreams interrupted her slumbers.\n\nFeverish and languid, she opened her eyes, and saw the unwelcome sun\ndart his rays through a window, the curtains of which she had forgotten\nto draw. The dew hung on the adjacent trees, and added to the lustre;\nthe little robin began his song, and distant birds joined. She looked;\nher countenance was still vacant--her sensibility was absorbed by one\nobject.\n\nDid I ever admire the rising sun, she slightly thought, turning from the\nWindow, and shutting her eyes: she recalled to view the last night's\nscene. His faltering voice, lingering step, and the look of tender woe,\nwere all graven on her heart; as were the words \"Could these arms\nshield thee from sorrow--afford thee an asylum from an unfeeling world.\"\nThe pressure to his bosom was not forgot. For a moment she was happy;\nbut in a long-drawn sigh every delightful sensation evaporated.\nSoon--yes, very soon, will the grave again receive all I love! and the\nremnant of my days--she could not proceed--Were there then days to come\nafter that?\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVIII.\n\n\nJust as she was going to quit her room, to visit Henry, his mother\ncalled on her.\n\n\"My son is worse to-day,\" said she, \"I come to request you to spend not\nonly this day, but a week or two with me.--Why should I conceal any\nthing from you? Last night my child made his mother his confident, and,\nin the anguish of his heart, requested me to be thy friend--when I shall\nbe childless. I will not attempt to describe what I felt when he talked\nthus to me. If I am to lose the support of my age, and be again a\nwidow--may I call her Child whom my Henry wishes me to adopt?\"\n\nThis new instance of Henry's disinterested affection, Mary felt most\nforcibly; and striving to restrain the complicated emotions, and sooth\nthe wretched mother, she almost fainted: when the unhappy parent forced\ntears from her, by saying, \"I deserve this blow; my partial fondness\nmade me neglect him, when most he wanted a mother's care; this neglect,\nperhaps, first injured his constitution: righteous Heaven has made my\ncrime its own punishment; and now I am indeed a mother, I shall loss my\nchild--my only child!\"\n\nWhen they were a little more composed they hastened to the invalide; but\nduring the short ride, the mother related several instances of Henry's\ngoodness of heart. Mary's tears were not those of unmixed anguish; the\ndisplay of his virtues gave her extreme delight--yet human nature\nprevailed; she trembled to think they would soon unfold themselves in a\nmore genial clime.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIX.\n\n\nShe found Henry very ill. The physician had some weeks before declared\nhe never knew a person with a similar pulse recover. Henry was certain\nhe could not live long; all the rest he could obtain, was procured by\nopiates. Mary now enjoyed the melancholy pleasure of nursing him, and\nsoftened by her tenderness the pains she could not remove. Every sigh\ndid she stifle, every tear restrain, when he could see or hear them. She\nwould boast of her resignation--yet catch eagerly at the least ray of\nhope. While he slept she would support his pillow, and rest her head\nwhere she could feel his breath. She loved him better than herself--she\ncould not pray for his recovery; she could only say, The will of Heaven\nbe done.\n\nWhile she was in this state, she labored to acquire fortitude; but one\ntender look destroyed it all--she rather labored, indeed, to make him\nbelieve he was resigned, than really to be so.\n\nShe wished to receive the sacrament with him, as a bond of union which\nwas to extend beyond the grave. She did so, and received comfort from\nit; she rose above her misery.\n\nHis end was now approaching. Mary sat on the side of the bed. His eyes\nappeared fixed--no longer agitated by passion, he only felt that it was\na fearful thing to die. The soul retired to the citadel; but it was not\nnow solely filled by the image of her who in silent despair watched for\nhis last breath. Collected, a frightful calmness stilled every turbulent\nemotion.\n\nThe mother's grief was more audible. Henry had for some time only\nattended to Mary--Mary pitied the parent, whose stings of conscience\nincreased her sorrow; she whispered him, \"Thy mother weeps, disregarded\nby thee; oh! comfort her!--My mother, thy son blesses thee.--\" The\noppressed parent left the room. And Mary _waited_ to see him die.\n\nShe pressed with trembling eagerness his parched lips--he opened his\neyes again; the spreading film retired, and love returned them--he gave\na look--it was never forgotten. My Mary, will you be comforted?\n\nYes, yes, she exclaimed in a firm voice; you go to be happy--I am not a\ncomplete wretch! The words almost choked her.\n\nHe was a long time silent; the opiate produced a kind of stupor. At\nlast, in an agony, he cried, It is dark; I cannot see thee; raise me up.\nWhere is Mary? did she not say she delighted to support me? let me die\nin her arms.\n\nHer arms were opened to receive him; they trembled not. Again he was\nobliged to lie down, resting on her: as the agonies increased he leaned\ntowards her: the soul seemed flying to her, as it escaped out of its\nprison. The breathing was interrupted; she heard distinctly the last\nsigh--and lifting up to Heaven her eyes, Father, receive his spirit, she\ncalmly cried.\n\nThe attendants gathered round; she moved not, nor heard the clamor; the\nhand seemed yet to press hers; it still was warm. A ray of light from\nan opened window discovered the pale face.\n\nShe left the room, and retired to one very near it; and sitting down on\nthe floor, fixed her eyes on the door of the apartment which contained\nthe body. Every event of her life rushed across her mind with wonderful\nrapidity--yet all was still--fate had given the finishing stroke. She\nsat till midnight.--Then rose in a phrensy, went into the apartment, and\ndesired those who watched the body to retire.\n\nShe knelt by the bed side;--an enthusiastic devotion overcame the\ndictates of despair.--She prayed most ardently to be supported, and\ndedicated herself to the service of that Being into whose hands, she had\ncommitted the spirit she almost adored--again--and again,--she prayed\nwildly--and fervently--but attempting to touch the lifeless hand--her\nhead swum--she sunk--\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXX.\n\n\nThree months after, her only friend, the mother of her lost Henry began\nto be alarmed, at observing her altered appearance; and made her own\nhealth a pretext for travelling. These complaints roused Mary out of her\ntorpid state; she imagined a new duty now forced her to exert herself--a\nduty love made sacred!--\n\nThey went to Bath, from that to Bristol; but the latter place they\nquickly left; the sight of the sick that resort there, they neither of\nthem could bear. From Bristol they flew to Southampton. The road was\npleasant--yet Mary shut her eyes;--or if they were open, green fields\nand commons, passed in quick succession, and left no more traces behind\nthan if they had been waves of the sea.\n\nSome time after they were settled at Southampton, they met the man who\ntook so much notice of Mary, soon after her return to England. He\nrenewed his acquaintance; he was really interested in her fate, as he\nhad heard her uncommon story; besides, he knew her husband; knew him to\nbe a good-natured, weak man. He saw him soon after his arrival in his\nnative country, and prevented his hastening to enquire into the reasons\nof Mary's strange conduct. He desired him not to be too precipitate, if\nhe ever wished to possess an invaluable treasure. He was guided by him,\nand allowed him to follow Mary to Southampton, and speak first to her\nfriend.\n\nThis friend determined to trust to her native strength of mind, and\ninformed her of the circumstance; but she overrated it: Mary was not\nable, for a few days after the intelligence, to fix on the mode of\nconduct she ought now to pursue. But at last she conquered her disgust,\nand wrote her _husband_ an account of what had passed since she had\ndropped his correspondence.\n\nHe came in person to answer the letter. Mary fainted when he approached\nher unexpectedly. Her disgust returned with additional force, in spite\nof previous reasonings, whenever he appeared; yet she was prevailed on\nto promise to live with him, if he would permit her to pass one year,\ntravelling from place to place; he was not to accompany her.\n\nThe time too quickly elapsed, and she gave him her hand--the struggle\nwas almost more than she could endure. She tried to appear calm; time\nmellowed her grief, and mitigated her torments; but when her husband\nwould take her hand, or mention any thing like love, she would instantly\nfeel a sickness, a faintness at her heart, and wish, involuntarily, that\nthe earth would open and swallow her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXI.\n\n\nMary visited the continent, and sought health in different climates; but\nher nerves were not to be restored to their former state. She then\nretired to her house in the country, established manufactories, threw\nthe estate into small farms; and continually employed herself this way\nto dissipate care, and banish unavailing regret. She visited the sick,\nsupported the old, and educated the young.\n\nThese occupations engrossed her mind; but there were hours when all her\nformer woes would return and haunt her.--Whenever she did, or said, any\nthing she thought Henry would have approved of--she could not avoid\nthinking with anguish, of the rapture his approbation ever conveyed to\nher heart--a heart in which there was a void, that even benevolence and\nreligion could not fill. The latter taught her to struggle for\nresignation; and the former rendered life supportable.\n\nHer delicate state of health did not promise long life. In moments of\nsolitary sadness, a gleam of joy would dart across her mind--She thought\nshe was hastening to that world _where there is neither marrying_, nor\ngiving in marriage.",

her soft smiles shone afar,\n And her low voice was heard like love, and drew\n All living things towards this wonder new.\n\n 6.\n And first the spotted cameleopard came,\n And then the wise and fearless elephant;                      _90\n Then the sly serpent, in the golden flame\n Of his own volumes intervolved;--all gaunt\n And sanguine beasts her gentle looks made tame.\n They drank before her at her sacred fount;\n And every beast of beating heart grew bold,                   _95\n Such gentleness and power even to behold.\n\n 7.\n The brinded lioness led forth her young,\n That she might teach them how they should forego\n Their inborn thirst of death; the pard unstrung\n His sinews at her feet, and sought to know                    _100\n With looks whose motions spoke without a tongue\n How he might be as gentle as the doe.\n The magic circle of her voice and eyes\n All savage natures did imparadise.\n\n 8.\n And old Silenus, shaking a green stick                        _105\n Of lilies, and the wood-gods in a crew\n Came, blithe, as in the olive copses thick\n Cicadae are, drunk with the noonday dew:\n And Dryope and Faunus followed quick,\n Teasing the God to sing them something new;                   _110\n Till in this cave they found the lady lone,\n Sitting upon a seat of emerald stone.\n\n 9.\n And universal Pan, 'tis said, was there,\n And though none saw him,--through the adamant\n Of the deep mountains, through the trackless air,             _115\n And through those living spirits, like a want,\n He passed out of his everlasting lair\n Where the quick heart of the great world doth pant,\n And felt that wondrous lady all alone,--\n And she felt him, upon her emerald throne.                    _120\n\n 10.\n And every nymph of stream and spreading tree,\n And every shepherdess of Ocean's flocks,\n Who drives her white waves over the green sea,\n And Ocean with the brine on his gray locks,\n And quaint Priapus with his company,                          _125\n All came, much wondering how the enwombed rocks\n Could have brought forth so beautiful a birth;--\n Her love subdued their wonder and their mirth.\n\n 11.\n The herdsmen and the mountain maidens came,\n And the rude kings of pastoral Garamant--                     _130\n Their spirits shook within them, as a flame\n Stirred by the air under a cavern gaunt:\n Pigmies, and Polyphemes, by many a name,\n Centaurs, and Satyrs, and such shapes as haunt\n Wet clefts,--and lumps neither alive nor dead,                _135\n Dog-headed, bosom-eyed, and bird-footed.\n\n 12.\n For she was beautiful--her beauty made\n The bright world dim, and everything beside\n Seemed like the fleeting image of a shade:\n No thought of living spirit could abide,                      _140\n Which to her looks had ever been betrayed,\n On any object in the world so wide,\n On any hope within the circling skies,\n But on her form, and in her inmost eyes.\n\n 13.\n Which when the lady knew, she took her spindle                _145\n And twined three threads of fleecy mist, and three\n Long lines of light, such as the dawn may kindle\n The clouds and waves and mountains with; and she\n As many star-beams, ere their lamps could dwindle\n In the belated moon, wound skilfully;                         _150\n And with these threads a subtle veil she wove--\n A shadow for the splendour of her love.\n\n 14.\n The deep recesses of her odorous dwelling\n Were stored with magic treasures--sounds of air,\n Which had the power all spirits of compelling,                _155\n Folded in cells of crystal silence there;\n Such as we hear in youth, and think the feeling\n Will never die--yet ere we are aware,\n The feeling and the sound are fled and gone,\n And the regret they leave remains alone.                      _160\n\n 15.\n And there lay Visions swift, and sweet, and quaint,\n Each in its thin sheath, like a chrysalis,\n Some eager to burst forth, some weak and faint\n With the soft burthen of intensest bliss.\n It was its work to bear to many a saint                       _165\n Whose heart adores the shrine which holiest is,\n Even Love's:--and others white, green, gray, and black,\n And of all shapes--and each was at her beck.\n\n 16.\n And odours in a kind of aviary\n Of ever-blooming Eden-trees she kept,                         _170\n Clipped in a floating net, a love-sick Fairy\n Had woven from dew-beams while the moon yet slept;\n As bats at the wired window of a dairy,\n They beat their vans; and each was an adept,\n When loosed and missioned, making wings of winds,             _175\n To stir sweet thoughts or sad, in destined minds.\n\n 17.\n And liquors clear and sweet, whose healthful might\n Could medicine the sick soul to happy sleep,\n And change eternal death into a night\n Of glorious dreams--or if eyes needs must weep,               _180\n Could make their tears all wonder and delight,\n She in her crystal vials did closely keep:\n If men could drink of those clear vials, 'tis said\n The living were not envied of the dead.\n\n 18.\n Her cave was stored with scrolls of strange device,           _185\n The works of some Saturnian Archimage,\n Which taught the expiations at whose price\n Men from the Gods might win that happy age\n Too lightly lost, redeeming native vice;\n And which might quench the Earth-consuming rage               _190\n Of gold and blood--till men should live and move\n Harmonious as the sacred stars above;\n\n 19.\n And how all things that seem untameable,\n Not to be checked and not to be confined,\n Obey the spells of Wisdom's wizard skill;                     _195\n Time, earth, and fire--the ocean and the wind,\n And all their shapes--and man's imperial will;\n And other scrolls whose writings did unbind\n The inmost lore of Love--let the profane\n Tremble to ask what secrets they contain.                     _200\n\n 20.\n And wondrous works of substances unknown,\n To which the enchantment of her father's power\n Had changed those ragged blocks of savage stone,\n Were heaped in the recesses of her bower;\n Carved lamps and chalices, and vials which shone              _205\n In their own golden beams--each like a flower,\n Out of whose depth a fire-fly shakes his light\n Under a cypress in a starless night.\n\n 21.\n At first she lived alone in this wild home,\n And her own thoughts were each a minister,                    _210\n Clothing themselves, or with the ocean foam,\n Or with the wind, or with the speed of fire,\n To work whatever purposes might come\n Into her mind; such power her mighty Sire\n Had girt them with, whether to fly or run,                    _215\n Through all the regions which he shines upon.\n\n 22.\n The Ocean-nymphs and Hamadryades,\n Oreads and Naiads, with long weedy locks,\n Offered to do her bidding through the seas,\n Under the earth, and in the hollow rocks,                     _220\n And far beneath the matted roots of trees,\n And in the gnarled heart of stubborn oaks,\n So they might live for ever in the light\n Of her sweet presence--each a satellite.\n\n 23.\n 'This may not be,' the wizard maid replied;                   _225\n 'The fountains where the Naiades bedew\n Their shining hair, at length are drained and dried;\n The solid oaks forget their strength, and strew\n Their latest leaf upon the mountains wide;\n The boundless ocean like a drop of dew                        _230\n Will be consumed--the stubborn centre must\n Be scattered, like a cloud of summer dust.\n\n 24.\n 'And ye with them will perish, one by one;--\n If I must sigh to think that this shall be,\n If I must weep when the surviving Sun                         _235\n Shall smile on your decay--oh, ask not me\n To love you till your little race is run;\n I cannot die as ye must--over me\n Your leaves shall glance--the streams in which ye dwell\n Shall be my paths henceforth, and so--farewell!'--            _240\n\n 25.\n She spoke and wept:--the dark and azure well\n Sparkled beneath the shower of her bright tears,\n And every little circlet where they fell\n Flung to the cavern-roof inconstant spheres\n And intertangled lines of light:--a knell                     _245\n Of sobbing voices came upon her ears\n From those departing Forms, o'er the serene\n Of the white streams and of the forest green.\n\n 26.\n All day the wizard lady sate aloof,\n Spelling out scrolls of dread antiquity,                      _250\n Under the cavern's fountain-lighted roof;\n Or broidering the pictured poesy\n Of some high tale upon her growing woof,\n Which the sweet splendour of her smiles could dye\n In hues outshining heaven--and ever she                       _255\n Added some grace to the wrought poesy.\n\n 27.\n While on her hearth lay blazing many a piece\n Of sandal wood, rare gums, and cinnamon;\n Men scarcely know how beautiful fire is--\n Each flame of it is as a precious stone                       _260\n Dissolved in ever-moving light, and this\n Belongs to each and all who gaze upon.\n The Witch beheld it not, for in her hand\n She held a woof that dimmed the burning brand.\n\n 28.\n This lady never slept, but lay in trance                      _265\n All night within the fountain--as in sleep.\n Its emerald crags glowed in her beauty's glance;\n Through the green splendour of the water deep\n She saw the constellations reel and dance\n Like fire-flies--and withal did ever keep                     _270\n The tenour of her contemplations calm,\n With open eyes, closed feet, and folded palm.\n\n 29.\n And when the whirlwinds and the clouds descended\n From the white pinnacles of that cold hill,\n She passed at dewfall to a space extended,                    _275\n Where in a lawn of flowering asphodel\n Amid a wood of pines and cedars blended,\n There yawned an inextinguishable well\n Of crimson fire--full even to the brim,\n And overflowing all the margin trim.                          _280\n\n 30.\n Within the which she lay when the fierce war\n Of wintry winds shook that innocuous liquor\n In many a mimic moon and bearded star\n O'er woods and lawns;--the serpent heard it flicker\n In sleep, and dreaming still, he crept afar--                 _285\n And when the windless snow descended thicker\n Than autumn leaves, she watched it as it came\n Melt on the surface of the level flame.\n\n 31.\n She had a boat, which some say Vulcan wrought\n For Venus, as the chariot of her star;                        _290\n But it was found too feeble to be fraught\n With all the ardours in that sphere which are,\n And so she sold it, and Apollo bought\n And gave it to this daughter: from a car\n Changed to the fairest and the lightest boat                  _295\n Which ever upon mortal stream did float.\n\n 32.\n And others say, that, when but three hours old,\n The first-born Love out of his cradle lept,\n And clove dun Chaos with his wings of gold,\n And like a horticultural adept,                               _300\n Stole a strange seed, and wrapped it up in mould,\n And sowed it in his mother's star, and kept\n Watering it all the summer with sweet dew,\n And with his wings fanning it as it grew.\n\n 33.\n The plant grew strong and green, the snowy flower             _305\n Fell, and the long and gourd-like fruit began\n To turn the light and dew by inward power\n To its own substance; woven tracery ran\n Of light firm texture, ribbed and branching, o'er\n The solid rind, like a leaf's veined fan--                    _310\n Of which Love scooped this boat--and with soft motion\n Piloted it round the circumfluous ocean.\n\n 34.\n This boat she moored upon her fount, and lit\n A living spirit within all its frame,\n Breathing the soul of swiftness into it.                      _315\n Couched on the fountain like a panther tame,\n One of the twain at Evan's feet that sit--\n Or as on Vesta's sceptre a swift flame--\n Or on blind Homer's heart a winged thought,--\n In joyous expectation lay the boat.                           _320\n\n 35.\n Then by strange art she kneaded fire and snow\n Together, tempering the repugnant mass\n With liquid love--all things together grow\n Through which the harmony of love can pass;\n And a fair Shape out of her hands did flow--                  _325\n A living Image, which did far surpass\n In beauty that bright shape of vital stone\n Which drew the heart out of Pygmalion.\n\n 36.\n A sexless thing it was, and in its growth\n It seemed to have developed no defect                         _330\n Of either sex, yet all the grace of both,--\n In gentleness and strength its limbs were decked;\n The bosom swelled lightly with its full youth,\n The countenance was such as might select\n Some artist that his skill should never die,                  _335\n Imaging forth such perfect purity.\n\n 37.\n From its smooth shoulders hung two rapid wings,\n Fit to have borne it to the seventh sphere,\n Tipped with the speed of liquid lightenings,\n Dyed in the ardours of the atmosphere:                        _340\n She led her creature to the boiling springs\n Where the light boat was moored, and said: 'Sit here!'\n And pointed to the prow, and took her seat\n Beside the rudder, with opposing feet.\n\n 38.\n And down the streams which clove those mountains vast,        _345\n Around their inland islets, and amid\n The panther-peopled forests whose shade cast\n Darkness and odours, and a pleasure hid\n In melancholy gloom, the pinnace passed;\n By many a star-surrounded pyramid                             _350\n Of icy crag cleaving the purple sky,\n And caverns yawning round unfathomably.\n\n 39.\n The silver noon into that winding dell,\n With slanted gleam athwart the forest tops,\n Tempered like golden evening, feebly fell;                    _355\n A green and glowing light, like that which drops\n From folded lilies in which glow-worms dwell,\n When Earth over her face Night's mantle wraps;\n Between the severed mountains lay on high,\n Over the stream, a narrow rift of sky.                        _360\n\n 40.\n And ever as she went, the Image lay\n With folded wings and unawakened eyes;\n And o'er its gentle countenance did play\n The busy dreams, as thick as summer flies,\n Chasing the rapid smiles that would not stay,                 _365\n And drinking the warm tears, and the sweet sighs\n Inhaling, which, with busy murmur vain,\n They had aroused from that full heart and brain.\n\n 41.\n And ever down the prone vale, like a cloud\n Upon a stream of wind, the pinnace went:                      _370\n Now lingering on the pools, in which abode\n The calm and darkness of the deep content\n In which they paused; now o'er the shallow road\n Of white and dancing waters, all besprent\n With sand and polished pebbles:--mortal boat                  _375\n In such a shallow rapid could not float.\n\n 42.\n And down the earthquaking cataracts which shiver\n Their snow-like waters into golden air,\n Or under chasms unfathomable ever\n Sepulchre them, till in their rage they tear                  _380\n A subterranean portal for the river,\n It fled--the circling sunbows did upbear\n Its fall down the hoar precipice of spray,\n Lighting it far upon its lampless way.\n\n 43.\n And when the wizard lady would ascend                         _385\n The labyrinths of some many-winding vale,\n Which to the inmost mountain upward tend--\n She called 'Hermaphroditus!'--and the pale\n And heavy hue which slumber could extend\n Over its lips and eyes, as on the gale                        _390\n A rapid shadow from a slope of grass,\n Into the darkness of the stream did pass.\n\n 44.\n And it unfurled its heaven-coloured pinions,\n With stars of fire spotting the stream below;\n And from above into the Sun's dominions                       _395\n Flinging a glory, like the golden glow\n In which Spring clothes her emerald-winged minions,\n All interwoven with fine feathery snow\n And moonlight splendour of intensest rime,\n With which frost paints the pines in winter time.             _400\n\n 45.\n And then it winnowed the Elysian air\n Which ever hung about that lady bright,\n With its aethereal vans--and speeding there,\n Like a star up the torrent of the night,\n Or a swift eagle in the morning glare                         _405\n Breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight,\n The pinnace, oared by those enchanted wings,\n Clove the fierce streams towards their upper springs.\n\n 46.\n The water flashed, like sunlight by the prow\n Of a noon-wandering meteor flung to Heaven;                   _410\n The still air seemed as if its waves did flow\n In tempest down the mountains; loosely driven\n The lady's radiant hair streamed to and fro:\n Beneath, the billows having vainly striven\n Indignant and impetuous, roared to feel                       _415\n The swift and steady motion of the keel.\n\n 47.\n Or, when the weary moon was in the wane,\n Or in the noon of interlunar night,\n The lady-witch in visions could not chain\n Her spirit; but sailed forth under the light                  _420\n Of shooting stars, and bade extend amain\n Its storm-outspeeding wings, the Hermaphrodite;\n She to the Austral waters took her way,\n Beyond the fabulous Thamondocana,--\n\n 48.\n Where, like a meadow which no scythe has shaven,              _425\n Which rain could never bend, or whirl-blast shake,\n With the Antarctic constellations paven,\n Canopus and his crew, lay the Austral lake--\n There she would build herself a windless haven\n Out of the clouds whose moving turrets make                   _430\n The bastions of the storm, when through the sky\n The spirits of the tempest thundered by:\n\n 49.\n A haven beneath whose translucent floor\n The tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably,\n And around which the solid vapours hoar,                      _435\n Based on the level waters, to the sky\n Lifted their dreadful crags, and like a shore\n Of wintry mountains, inaccessibly\n Hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray,\n And hanging crags, many a cove and bay.                       _440\n\n 50.\n And whilst the outer lake beneath the lash\n Of the wind's scourge, foamed like a wounded thing,\n And the incessant hail with stony clash\n Ploughed up the waters, and the flagging wing\n Of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash                _445\n Looked like the wreck of some wind-wandering\n Fragment of inky thunder-smoke--this haven\n Was as a gem to copy Heaven engraven,--\n\n 51.\n On which that lady played her many pranks,\n Circling the image of a shooting star,                        _450\n Even as a tiger on Hydaspes' banks\n Outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are,\n In her light boat; and many quips and cranks\n She played upon the water, till the car\n Of the late moon, like a sick matron wan,                     _455\n To journey from the misty east began.\n\n 52.\n And then she called out of the hollow turrets\n Of those high clouds, white, golden and vermilion,\n The armies of her ministering spirits--\n In mighty legions, million after million,                     _460\n They came, each troop emblazoning its merits\n On meteor flags; and many a proud pavilion\n Of the intertexture of the atmosphere\n They pitched upon the plain of the calm mere.\n\n 53.\n They framed the imperial tent of their great Queen            _465\n Of woven exhalations, underlaid\n With lambent lightning-fire, as may be seen\n A dome of thin and open ivory inlaid\n With crimson silk--cressets from the serene\n Hung there, and on the water for her tread                    _470\n A tapestry of fleece-like mist was strewn,\n Dyed in the beams of the ascending moon.\n\n 54.\n And on a throne o'erlaid with starlight, caught\n Upon those wandering isles of aery dew,\n Which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not,               _475\n She sate, and heard all that had happened new\n Between the earth and moon, since they had brought\n The last intelligence--and now she grew\n Pale as that moon, lost in the watery night--\n And now she wept, and now she laughed outright.               _480\n\n 55.\n These were tame pleasures; she would often climb\n The steepest ladder of the crudded rack\n Up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime,\n And like Arion on the dolphin's back\n Ride singing through the shoreless air;--oft-time             _485\n Following the serpent lightning's winding track,\n She ran upon the platforms of the wind,\n And laughed to hear the fire-balls roar behind.\n\n 56.\n And sometimes to those streams of upper air\n Which whirl the earth in its diurnal round,                   _490\n She would ascend, and win the spirits there\n To let her join their chorus. Mortals found\n That on those days the sky was calm and fair,\n And mystic snatches of harmonious sound\n Wandered upon the earth where'er she passed,                  _495\n And happy thoughts of hope, too sweet to last.\n\n 57.\n But her choice sport was, in the hours of sleep,\n To glide adown old Nilus, where he threads\n Egypt and Aethiopia, from the steep\n Of utmost Axume, until he spreads,                            _500\n Like a calm flock of silver-fleeced sheep,\n His waters on the plain: and crested heads\n Of cities and proud temples gleam amid,\n And many a vapour-belted pyramid.\n\n 58.\n By Moeris and the Mareotid lakes,                             _505\n Strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors,\n Where naked boys bridling tame water-snakes,\n Or charioteering ghastly alligators,\n Had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes\n Of those huge forms--within the brazen doors                  _510\n Of the great Labyrinth slept both boy and beast,\n Tired with the pomp of their Osirian feast.\n\n 59.\n And where within the surface of the river\n The shadows of the massy temples lie,\n And never are erased--but tremble ever                        _515\n Like things which every cloud can doom to die,\n Through lotus-paven canals, and wheresoever\n The works of man pierced that serenest sky\n With tombs, and towers, and fanes, 'twas her delight\n To wander in the shadow of the night.                         _520\n\n 60.\n With motion like the spirit of that wind\n Whose soft step deepens slumber, her light feet\n Passed through the peopled haunts of humankind.\n Scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet,\n Through fane, and palace-court, and labyrinth mined           _525\n With many a dark and subterranean street\n Under the Nile, through chambers high and deep\n She passed, observing mortals in their sleep.\n\n 61.\n A pleasure sweet doubtless it was to see\n Mortals subdued in all the shapes of sleep.                   _530\n Here lay two sister twins in infancy;\n There, a lone youth who in his dreams did weep;\n Within, two lovers linked innocently\n In their loose locks which over both did creep\n Like ivy from one stem;--and there lay calm                   _535\n Old age with snow-bright hair and folded palm.\n\n 62.\n But other troubled forms of sleep she saw,\n Not to be mirrored in a holy song--\n Distortions foul of supernatural awe,\n And pale imaginings of visioned wrong;                        _540\n And all the code of Custom's lawless law\n Written upon the brows of old and young:\n 'This,' said the wizard maiden, 'is the strife\n Which stirs the liquid surface of man's life.'\n\n 63.\n And little did the sight disturb her soul.--                  _545\n We, the weak mariners of that wide lake\n Where'er its shores extend or billows roll,\n Our course unpiloted and starless make\n O'er its wild surface to an unknown goal:--\n But she in the calm depths her way could take,                _550\n Where in bright bowers immortal forms abide\n Beneath the weltering of the restless tide.\n\n 64.\n And she saw princes couched under the glow\n Of sunlike gems; and round each temple-court\n In dormitories ranged, row after row,                         _555\n She saw the priests asleep--all of one sort--\n For all were educated to be so.--\n The peasants in their huts, and in the port\n The sailors she saw cradled on the waves,\n And the dead lulled within their dreamless graves.            _560\n\n 65.\n And all the forms in which those spirits lay\n Were to her sight like the diaphanous\n Veils, in which those sweet ladies oft array\n Their delicate limbs, who would conceal from us\n Only their scorn of all concealment: they                     _565\n Move in the light of their own beauty thus.\n But these and all now lay with sleep upon them,\n And little thought a Witch was looking on them.\n\n 66.\n She, all those human figures breathing there,\n Beheld as living spirits--to her eyes                         _570\n The naked beauty of the soul lay bare,\n And often through a rude and worn disguise\n She saw the inner form most bright and fair--\n And then she had a charm of strange device,\n Which, murmured on mute lips with tender tone,                _575\n Could make that spirit mingle with her own.\n\n 67.\n Alas! Aurora, what wouldst thou have given\n For such a charm when Tithon became gray?\n Or how much, Venus, of thy silver heaven\n Wouldst thou have yielded, ere Proserpina                     _580\n Had half (oh! why not all?) the debt forgiven\n Which dear Adonis had been doomed to pay,\n To any witch who would have taught you it?\n The Heliad doth not know its value yet.\n\n 68.\n 'Tis said in after times her spirit free                      _585\n Knew what love was, and felt itself alone--\n But holy Dian could not chaster be\n Before she stooped to kiss Endymion,\n Than now this lady--like a sexless bee\n Tasting all blossoms, and confined to none,                   _590\n Among those mortal forms, the wizard-maiden\n Passed with an eye serene and heart unladen.\n\n 69.\n To those she saw most beautiful, she gave\n Strange panacea in a crystal bowl:--\n They drank in their deep sleep of that sweet wave,            _595\n And lived thenceforward as if some control,\n Mightier than life, were in them; and the grave\n Of such, when death oppressed the weary soul,\n Was as a green and overarching bower\n Lit by the gems of many a starry flower.                      _600\n\n 70.\n For on the night when they were buried, she\n Restored the embalmers' ruining, and shook\n The light out of the funeral lamps, to be\n A mimic day within that deathy nook;\n And she unwound the woven imagery                             _605\n Of second childhood's swaddling bands, and took\n The coffin, its last cradle, from its niche,\n And threw it with contempt into a ditch.\n\n 71.\n And there the body lay, age after age.\n Mute, breathing, beating, warm, and undecaying,               _610\n Like one asleep in a green hermitage,\n With gentle smiles about its eyelids playing,\n And living in its dreams beyond the rage\n Of death or life; while they were still arraying\n In liveries ever new, the rapid, blind                        _615\n And fleeting generations of mankind.\n\n 72.\n And she would write strange dreams upon the brain\n Of those who were less beautiful, and make\n All harsh and crooked purposes more vain\n Than in the desert is the serpent's wake                      _620\n Which the sand covers--all his evil gain\n The miser in such dreams would rise and shake\n Into a beggar's lap;--the lying scribe\n Would his own lies betray without a bribe.\n\n 73.\n The priests would write an explanation full,                  _625\n Translating hieroglyphics into Greek,\n How the God Apis really was a bull,\n And nothing more; and bid the herald stick\n The same against the temple doors, and pull\n The old cant down; they licensed all to speak                 _630\n Whate'er they thought of hawks, and cats, and geese,\n By pastoral letters to each diocese.\n\n 74.\n The king would dress an ape up in his crown\n And robes, and seat him on his glorious seat,\n And on the right hand of the sunlike throne                   _635\n Would place a gaudy mock-bird to repeat\n The chatterings of the monkey.--Every one\n Of the prone courtiers crawled to kiss the feet\n Of their great Emperor, when the morning came,\n And kissed--alas, how many kiss the same!                     _640\n\n 75.\n The soldiers dreamed that they were blacksmiths, and\n Walked out of quarters in somnambulism;\n Round the red anvils you might see them stand\n Like Cyclopses in Vulcan's sooty abysm,\n Beating their swords to ploughshares;--in a band              _645\n The gaolers sent those of the liberal schism\n Free through the streets of Memphis, much, I wis,\n To the annoyance of king Amasis.\n\n 76.\n And timid lovers who had been so coy,\n They hardly knew whether they loved or not,                   _650\n Would rise out of their rest, and take sweet joy,\n To the fulfilment of their inmost thought;\n And when next day the maiden and the boy\n Met one another, both, like sinners caught,\n Blushed at the thing which each believed was done             _655\n Only in fancy--till the tenth moon shone;\n\n 77.\n And then the Witch would let them take no ill:\n Of many thousand schemes which lovers find,\n The Witch found one,--and so they took their fill\n Of happiness in marriage warm and kind.                       _660\n Friends who, by practice of some envious skill,\n Were torn apart--a wide wound, mind from mind!--\n She did unite again with visions clear\n Of deep affection and of truth sincere.\n\n 80.\n These were the pranks she played among the cities             _665\n Of mortal men, and what she did to Sprites\n And Gods, entangling them in her sweet ditties\n To do her will, and show their subtle sleights,\n I will declare another time; for it is\n A tale more fit for the weird winter nights                   _670\n Than for these garish summer days, when we\n Scarcely believe much more than we can see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Witch of Atlas, by Percy Bysshe Shelley",

Time is precious, and Crito\nhas come early in order to gain his consent to a plan of escape.  This can\nbe easily accomplished by his friends, who will incur no danger in making\nthe attempt to save him, but will be disgraced for ever if they allow him\nto perish.  He should think of his duty to his children, and not play into\nthe hands of his enemies.  Money is already provided by Crito as well as by\nSimmias and others, and he will have no difficulty in finding friends in\nThessaly and other places.\n\nSocrates is afraid that Crito is but pressing upon him the opinions of the\nmany:  whereas, all his life long he has followed the dictates of reason\nonly and the opinion of the one wise or skilled man.  There was a time when\nCrito himself had allowed the propriety of this.  And although some one\nwill say 'the many can kill us,' that makes no difference; but a good life,\nin other words, a just and honourable life, is alone to be valued.  All\nconsiderations of loss of reputation or injury to his children should be\ndismissed:  the only question is whether he would be right in attempting to\nescape.  Crito, who is a disinterested person not having the fear of death\nbefore his eyes, shall answer this for him.  Before he was condemned they\nhad often held discussions, in which they agreed that no man should either\ndo evil, or return evil for evil, or betray the right.  Are these\nprinciples to be altered because the circumstances of Socrates are altered?\nCrito admits that they remain the same.  Then is his escape consistent with\nthe maintenance of them?  To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.\n\nSocrates proceeds:--Suppose the Laws of Athens to come and remonstrate with\nhim:  they will ask 'Why does he seek to overturn them?' and if he replies,\n'they have injured him,' will not the Laws answer, 'Yes, but was that the\nagreement?  Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in\noverturning them?  Was he not brought into the world and educated by their\nhelp, and are they not his parents?  He might have left Athens and gone\nwhere he pleased, but he has lived there for seventy years more constantly\nthan any other citizen.'  Thus he has clearly shown that he acknowledged\nthe agreement, which he cannot now break without dishonour to himself and\ndanger to his friends.  Even in the course of the trial he might have\nproposed exile as the penalty, but then he declared that he preferred death\nto exile.  And whither will he direct his footsteps?  In any well-ordered\nstate the Laws will consider him as an enemy.  Possibly in a land of\nmisrule like Thessaly he may be welcomed at first, and the unseemly\nnarrative of his escape will be regarded by the inhabitants as an amusing\ntale.  But if he offends them he will have to learn another sort of lesson.\nWill he continue to give lectures in virtue?  That would hardly be decent.\nAnd how will his children be the gainers if he takes them into Thessaly,\nand deprives them of Athenian citizenship?  Or if he leaves them behind,\ndoes he expect that they will be better taken care of by his friends\nbecause he is in Thessaly?  Will not true friends care for them equally\nwhether he is alive or dead?\n\nFinally, they exhort him to think of justice first, and of life and\nchildren afterwards.  He may now depart in peace and innocence, a sufferer\nand not a doer of evil.  But if he breaks agreements, and returns evil for\nevil, they will be angry with him while he lives; and their brethren the\nLaws of the world below will receive him as an enemy.  Such is the mystic\nvoice which is always murmuring in his ears.\n\nThat Socrates was not a good citizen was a charge made against him during\nhis lifetime, which has been often repeated in later ages.  The crimes of\nAlcibiades, Critias, and Charmides, who had been his pupils, were still\nrecent in the memory of the now restored democracy.  The fact that he had\nbeen neutral in the death-struggle of Athens was not likely to conciliate\npopular good-will.  Plato, writing probably in the next generation,\nundertakes the defence of his friend and master in this particular, not to\nthe Athenians of his day, but to posterity and the world at large.\n\nWhether such an incident ever really occurred as the visit of Crito and the\nproposal of escape is uncertain:  Plato could easily have invented far more\nthan that (Phaedr.); and in the selection of Crito, the aged friend, as the\nfittest person to make the proposal to Socrates, we seem to recognize the\nhand of the artist.  Whether any one who has been subjected by the laws of\nhis country to an unjust judgment is right in attempting to escape, is a\nthesis about which casuists might disagree.  Shelley (Prose Works) is of\nopinion that Socrates 'did well to die,' but not for the 'sophistical'\nreasons which Plato has put into his mouth.  And there would be no\ndifficulty in arguing that Socrates should have lived and preferred to a\nglorious death the good which he might still be able to perform.  'A\nrhetorician would have had much to say upon that point.'  It may be\nobserved however that Plato never intended to answer the question of\ncasuistry, but only to exhibit the ideal of patient virtue which refuses to\ndo the least evil in order to avoid the greatest, and to show his master\nmaintaining in death the opinions which he had professed in his life.  Not\n'the world,' but the 'one wise man,' is still the paradox of Socrates in\nhis last hours.  He must be guided by reason, although her conclusions may\nbe fatal to him.  The remarkable sentiment that the wicked can do neither\ngood nor evil is true, if taken in the sense, which he means, of moral\nevil; in his own words, 'they cannot make a man wise or foolish.'\n\nThis little dialogue is a perfect piece of dialectic, in which granting the\n'common principle,' there is no escaping from the conclusion.  It is\nanticipated at the beginning by the dream of Socrates and the parody of\nHomer.  The personification of the Laws, and of their brethren the Laws in\nthe world below, is one of the noblest and boldest figures of speech which\noccur in Plato.\n\n\nCRITO\n\nby\n\nPlato\n\nTranslated by Benjamin Jowett\n\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:  Socrates, Crito.\n\nSCENE:  The Prison of Socrates.\n\n\nSOCRATES:  Why have you come at this hour, Crito? it must be quite early.\n\nCRITO:  Yes, certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  What is the exact time?\n\nCRITO:  The dawn is breaking.\n\nSOCRATES:  I wonder that the keeper of the prison would let you in.\n\nCRITO:  He knows me because I often come, Socrates; moreover.  I have done\nhim a kindness.\n\nSOCRATES:  And are you only just arrived?\n\nCRITO:  No, I came some time ago.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then why did you sit and say nothing, instead of at once\nawakening me?\n\nCRITO:  I should not have liked myself, Socrates, to be in such great\ntrouble and unrest as you are--indeed I should not:  I have been watching\nwith amazement your peaceful slumbers; and for that reason I did not awake\nyou, because I wished to minimize the pain.  I have always thought you to\nbe of a happy disposition; but never did I see anything like the easy,\ntranquil manner in which you bear this calamity.\n\nSOCRATES:  Why, Crito, when a man has reached my age he ought not to be\nrepining at the approach of death.\n\nCRITO:  And yet other old men find themselves in similar misfortunes, and\nage does not prevent them from repining.\n\nSOCRATES:  That is true.  But you have not told me why you come at this\nearly hour.\n\nCRITO:  I come to bring you a message which is sad and painful; not, as I\nbelieve, to yourself, but to all of us who are your friends, and saddest of\nall to me.\n\nSOCRATES:  What?  Has the ship come from Delos, on the arrival of which I\nam to die?\n\nCRITO:  No, the ship has not actually arrived, but she will probably be\nhere to-day, as persons who have come from Sunium tell me that they have\nleft her there; and therefore to-morrow, Socrates, will be the last day of\nyour life.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very well, Crito; if such is the will of God, I am willing; but\nmy belief is that there will be a delay of a day.\n\nCRITO:  Why do you think so?\n\nSOCRATES:  I will tell you.  I am to die on the day after the arrival of\nthe ship?\n\nCRITO:  Yes; that is what the authorities say.\n\nSOCRATES:  But I do not think that the ship will be here until to-morrow;\nthis I infer from a vision which I had last night, or rather only just now,\nwhen you fortunately allowed me to sleep.\n\nCRITO:  And what was the nature of the vision?\n\nSOCRATES:  There appeared to me the likeness of a woman, fair and comely,\nclothed in bright raiment, who called to me and said:  O Socrates,\n\n'The third day hence to fertile Phthia shalt thou go.'  (Homer, Il.)\n\nCRITO:  What a singular dream, Socrates!\n\nSOCRATES:  There can be no doubt about the meaning, Crito, I think.\n\nCRITO:  Yes; the meaning is only too clear.  But, oh! my beloved Socrates,\nlet me entreat you once more to take my advice and escape.  For if you die\nI shall not only lose a friend who can never be replaced, but there is\nanother evil:  people who do not know you and me will believe that I might\nhave saved you if I had been willing to give money, but that I did not\ncare.  Now, can there be a worse disgrace than this--that I should be\nthought to value money more than the life of a friend?  For the many will\nnot be persuaded that I wanted you to escape, and that you refused.\n\nSOCRATES:  But why, my dear Crito, should we care about the opinion of the\nmany?  Good men, and they are the only persons who are worth considering,\nwill think of these things truly as they occurred.\n\nCRITO:  But you see, Socrates, that the opinion of the many must be\nregarded, for what is now happening shows that they can do the greatest\nevil to any one who has lost their good opinion.\n\nSOCRATES:  I only wish it were so, Crito; and that the many could do the\ngreatest evil; for then they would also be able to do the greatest good--\nand what a fine thing this would be!  But in reality they can do neither;\nfor they cannot make a man either wise or foolish; and whatever they do is\nthe result of chance.\n\nCRITO:  Well, I will not dispute with you; but please to tell me, Socrates,\nwhether you are not acting out of regard to me and your other friends:  are\nyou not afraid that if you escape from prison we may get into trouble with\nthe informers for having stolen you away, and lose either the whole or a\ngreat part of our property; or that even a worse evil may happen to us?\nNow, if you fear on our account, be at ease; for in order to save you, we\nought surely to run this, or even a greater risk; be persuaded, then, and\ndo as I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Yes, Crito, that is one fear which you mention, but by no means\nthe only one.\n\nCRITO:  Fear not--there are persons who are willing to get you out of\nprison at no great cost; and as for the informers they are far from being\nexorbitant in their demands--a little money will satisfy them.  My means,\nwhich are certainly ample, are at your service, and if you have a scruple\nabout spending all mine, here are strangers who will give you the use of\ntheirs; and one of them, Simmias the Theban, has brought a large sum of\nmoney for this very purpose; and Cebes and many others are prepared to\nspend their money in helping you to escape.  I say, therefore, do not\nhesitate on our account, and do not say, as you did in the court (compare\nApol.), that you will have a difficulty in knowing what to do with yourself\nanywhere else.  For men will love you in other places to which you may go,\nand not in Athens only; there are friends of mine in Thessaly, if you like\nto go to them, who will value and protect you, and no Thessalian will give\nyou any trouble.  Nor can I think that you are at all justified, Socrates,\nin betraying your own life when you might be saved; in acting thus you are\nplaying into the hands of your enemies, who are hurrying on your\ndestruction.  And further I should say that you are deserting your own\nchildren; for you might bring them up and educate them; instead of which\nyou go away and leave them, and they will have to take their chance; and if\nthey do not meet with the usual fate of orphans, there will be small thanks\nto you.  No man should bring children into the world who is unwilling to\npersevere to the end in their nurture and education.  But you appear to be\nchoosing the easier part, not the better and manlier, which would have been\nmore becoming in one who professes to care for virtue in all his actions,\nlike yourself.  And indeed, I am ashamed not only of you, but of us who are\nyour friends, when I reflect that the whole business will be attributed\nentirely to our want of courage.  The trial need never have come on, or\nmight have been managed differently; and this last act, or crowning folly,\nwill seem to have occurred through our negligence and cowardice, who might\nhave saved you, if we had been good for anything; and you might have saved\nyourself, for there was no difficulty at all.  See now, Socrates, how sad\nand discreditable are the consequences, both to us and you.  Make up your\nmind then, or rather have your mind already made up, for the time of\ndeliberation is over, and there is only one thing to be done, which must be\ndone this very night, and if we delay at all will be no longer practicable\nor possible; I beseech you therefore, Socrates, be persuaded by me, and do\nas I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Dear Crito, your zeal is invaluable, if a right one; but if\nwrong, the greater the zeal the greater the danger; and therefore we ought\nto consider whether I shall or shall not do as you say.  For I am and\nalways have been one of those natures who must be guided by reason,\nwhatever the reason may be which upon reflection appears to me to be the\nbest; and now that this chance has befallen me, I cannot repudiate my own\nwords:  the principles which I have hitherto honoured and revered I still\nhonour, and unless we can at once find other and better principles, I am\ncertain not to agree with you; no, not even if the power of the multitude\ncould inflict many more imprisonments, confiscations, deaths, frightening\nus like children with hobgoblin terrors (compare Apol.).  What will be the\nfairest way of considering the question?  Shall I return to your old\nargument about the opinions of men?--we were saying that some of them are\nto be regarded, and others not.  Now were we right in maintaining this\nbefore I was condemned?  And has the argument which was once good now\nproved to be talk for the sake of talking--mere childish nonsense?  That is\nwhat I want to consider with your help, Crito:--whether, under my present\ncircumstances, the argument appears to be in any way different or not; and\nis to be allowed by me or disallowed.  That argument, which, as I believe,\nis maintained by many persons of authority, was to the effect, as I was\nsaying, that the opinions of some men are to be regarded, and of other men\nnot to be regarded.  Now you, Crito, are not going to die to-morrow--at\nleast, there is no human probability of this, and therefore you are\ndisinterested and not liable to be deceived by the circumstances in which\nyou are placed.  Tell me then, whether I am right in saying that some\nopinions, and the opinions of some men only, are to be valued, and that\nother opinions, and the opinions of other men, are not to be valued.  I ask\nyou whether I was right in maintaining this?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  The good are to be regarded, and not the bad?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  And the opinions of the wise are good, and the opinions of the\nunwise are evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what was said about another matter?  Is the pupil who\ndevotes himself to the practice of gymnastics supposed to attend to the\npraise and blame and opinion of every man, or of one man only--his\nphysician or trainer, whoever he may be?\n\nCRITO:  Of one man only.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to fear the censure and welcome the praise of that\none only, and not of the many?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly so.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to act and train, and eat and drink in the way\nwhich seems good to his single master who has understanding, rather than\naccording to the opinion of all other men put together?\n\nCRITO:  True.\n\nSOCRATES:  And if he disobeys and disregards the opinion and approval of\nthe one, and regards the opinion of the many who have no understanding,\nwill he not suffer evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly he will.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what will the evil be, whither tending and what affecting,\nin the disobedient person?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly, affecting the body; that is what is destroyed by the evil.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very good; and is not this true, Crito, of other things which we\nneed not separately enumerate?  In questions of just and unjust, fair and\nfoul, good and evil, which are the subjects of our present consultation,\nought we to follow the opinion of the many and to fear them; or the opinion\nof the one man who has understanding? ought we not to fear and reverence\nhim more than all the rest of the world:  and if we desert him shall we not\ndestroy and injure that principle in us which may be assumed to be improved\nby justice and deteriorated by injustice;--there is such a principle?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly there is, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Take a parallel instance:--if, acting under the advice of those\nwho have no understanding, we destroy that which is improved by health and\nis deteriorated by disease, would life be worth having?  And that which has\nbeen destroyed is--the body?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Could we live, having an evil and corrupted body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  And will life be worth having, if that higher part of man be\ndestroyed, which is improved by justice and depraved by injustice?  Do we\nsuppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with\njustice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  More honourable than the body?\n\nCRITO:  Far more.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then, my friend, we must not regard what the many say of us:\nbut what he, the one man who has understanding of just and unjust, will\nsay, and what the truth will say.  And therefore you begin in error when\nyou advise that we should regard the opinion of the many about just and\nunjust, good and evil, honorable and dishonorable.--'Well,' some one will\nsay, 'but the many can kill us.'\n\nCRITO:  Yes, Socrates; that will clearly be the answer.\n\nSOCRATES:  And it is true; but still I find with surprise that the old\nargument is unshaken as ever.  And I should like to know whether I may say\nthe same of another proposition--that not life, but a good life, is to be\nchiefly valued?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, that also remains unshaken.\n\nSOCRATES:  And a good life is equivalent to a just and honorable one--that\nholds also?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, it does.\n\nSOCRATES:  From these premisses I proceed to argue the question whether I\nought or ought not to try and escape without the consent of the Athenians:\nand if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will make the attempt; but if\nnot, I will abstain.  The other considerations which you mention, of money\nand loss of character and the duty of educating one's children, are, I\nfear, only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready to restore\npeople to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death--and\nwith as little reason.  But now, since the argument has thus far prevailed,\nthe only question which remains to be considered is, whether we shall do\nrightly either in escaping or in suffering others to aid in our escape and\npaying them in money and thanks, or whether in reality we shall not do\nrightly; and if the latter, then death or any other calamity which may\nensue on my remaining here must not be allowed to enter into the\ncalculation.\n\nCRITO:  I think that you are right, Socrates; how then shall we proceed?\n\nSOCRATES:  Let us consider the matter together, and do you either refute me\nif you can, and I will be convinced; or else cease, my dear friend, from\nrepeating to me that I ought to escape against the wishes of the Athenians:\nfor I highly value your attempts to persuade me to do so, but I may not be\npersuaded against my own better judgment.  And now please to consider my\nfirst position, and try how you can best answer me.\n\nCRITO:  I will.\n\nSOCRATES:  Are we to say that we are never intentionally to do wrong, or\nthat in one way we ought and in another way we ought not to do wrong, or is\ndoing wrong always evil and dishonorable, as I was just now saying, and as\nhas been already acknowledged by us?  Are all our former admissions which\nwere made within a few days to be thrown away?  And have we, at our age,\nbeen earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to\ndiscover that we are no better than children?  Or, in spite of the opinion\nof the many, and in spite of consequences whether better or worse, shall we\ninsist on the truth of what was then said, that injustice is always an evil\nand dishonour to him who acts unjustly?  Shall we say so or not?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we must do no wrong?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Nor when injured injure in return, as the many imagine; for we\nmust injure no one at all?  (E.g. compare Rep.)\n\nCRITO:  Clearly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Again, Crito, may we do evil?\n\nCRITO:  Surely not, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is the morality\nof the many--is that just or not?\n\nCRITO:  Not just.\n\nSOCRATES:  For doing evil to another is the same as injuring him?\n\nCRITO:  Very true.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to any\none, whatever evil we may have suffered from him.  But I would have you\nconsider, Crito, whether you really mean what you are saying.  For this\nopinion has never been held, and never will be held, by any considerable\nnumber of persons; and those who are agreed and those who are not agreed\nupon this point have no common ground, and can only despise one another\nwhen they see how widely they differ.  Tell me, then, whether you agree\nwith and assent to my first principle, that neither injury nor retaliation\nnor warding off evil by evil is ever right.  And shall that be the premiss\nof our argument?  Or do you decline and dissent from this?  For so I have\never thought, and continue to think; but, if you are of another opinion,\nlet me hear what you have to say.  If, however, you remain of the same mind\nas formerly, I will proceed to the next step.\n\nCRITO:  You may proceed, for I have not changed my mind.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then I will go on to the next point, which may be put in the\nform of a question:--Ought a man to do what he admits to be right, or ought\nhe to betray the right?\n\nCRITO:  He ought to do what he thinks right.\n\nSOCRATES:  But if this is true, what is the application?  In leaving the\nprison against the will of the Athenians, do I wrong any? or rather do I\nnot wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?  Do I not desert the\nprinciples which were acknowledged by us to be just--what do you say?\n\nCRITO:  I cannot tell, Socrates, for I do not know.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then consider the matter in this way:--Imagine that I am about\nto play truant (you may call the proceeding by any name which you like),\nand the laws and the government come and interrogate me:  'Tell us,\nSocrates,' they say; 'what are you about? are you not going by an act of\nyours to overturn us--the laws, and the whole state, as far as in you lies?\nDo you imagine that a state can subsist and not be overthrown, in which the\ndecisions of law have no power, but are set aside and trampled upon by\nindividuals?'  What will be our answer, Crito, to these and the like words?\nAny one, and especially a rhetorician, will have a good deal to say on\nbehalf of the law which requires a sentence to be carried out.  He will\nargue that this law should not be set aside; and shall we reply, 'Yes; but\nthe state has injured us and given an unjust sentence.'  Suppose I say\nthat?\n\nCRITO:  Very good, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  'And was that our agreement with you?' the law would answer; 'or\nwere you to abide by the sentence of the state?'  And if I were to express\nmy astonishment at their words, the law would probably add:  'Answer,\nSocrates, instead of opening your eyes--you are in the habit of asking and\nanswering questions.  Tell us,--What complaint have you to make against us\nwhich justifies you in attempting to destroy us and the state?  In the\nfirst place did we not bring you into existence?  Your father married your\nmother by our aid and begat you.  Say whether you have any objection to\nurge against those of us who regulate marriage?'  None, I should reply.\n'Or against those of us who after birth regulate the nurture and education\nof children, in which you also were trained?  Were not the laws, which have\nthe charge of education, right in commanding your father to train you in\nmusic and gymnastic?'  Right, I should reply.  'Well then, since you were\nbrought into the world and nurtured and educated by us, can you deny in the\nfirst place that you are our child and slave, as your fathers were before\nyou?  And if this is true you are not on equal terms with us; nor can you\nthink that you have a right to do to us what we are doing to you.  Would\nyou have any right to strike or revile or do any other evil to your father\nor your master, if you had one, because you have been struck or reviled by\nhim, or received some other evil at his hands?--you would not say this?\nAnd because we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have any\nright to destroy us in return, and your country as far as in you lies?\nWill you, O professor of true virtue, pretend that you are justified in\nthis?  Has a philosopher like you failed to discover that our country is\nmore to be valued and higher and holier far than mother or father or any\nancestor, and more to be regarded in the eyes of the gods and of men of\nunderstanding? also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when\nangry, even more than a father, and either to be persuaded, or if not\npersuaded, to be obeyed?  And when we are punished by her, whether with\nimprisonment or stripes, the punishment is to be endured in silence; and if\nshe lead us to wounds or death in battle, thither we follow as is right;\nneither may any one yield or retreat or leave his rank, but whether in\nbattle or in a court of law, or in any other place, he must do what his\ncity and his country order him; or he must change their view of what is\njust:  and if he may do no violence to his father or mother, much less may\nhe do violence to his country.'  What answer shall we make to this, Crito?\nDo the laws speak truly, or do they not?\n\nCRITO:  I think that they do.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then the laws will say:  'Consider, Socrates, if we are speaking\ntruly that in your present attempt you are going to do us an injury.  For,\nhaving brought you into the world, and nurtured and educated you, and given\nyou and every other citizen a share in every good which we had to give, we\nfurther proclaim to any Athenian by the liberty which we allow him, that if\nhe does not like us when he has become of age and has seen the ways of the\ncity, and made our acquaintance, he may go where he pleases and take his\ngoods with him.  None of us laws will forbid him or interfere with him.\nAny one who does not like us and the city, and who wants to emigrate to a\ncolony or to any other city, may go where he likes, retaining his property.\nBut he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice and\nadminister the state, and still remains, has entered into an implied\ncontract that he will do as we command him.  And he who disobeys us is, as\nwe maintain, thrice wrong:  first, because in disobeying us he is\ndisobeying his parents; secondly, because we are the authors of his\neducation; thirdly, because he has made an agreement with us that he will\nduly obey our commands; and he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our\ncommands are unjust; and we do not rudely impose them, but give him the\nalternative of obeying or convincing us;--that is what we offer, and he\ndoes neither.\n\n'These are the sort of accusations to which, as we were saying, you,\nSocrates, will be exposed if you accomplish your intentions; you, above all\nother Athenians.'  Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else? they\nwill justly retort upon me that I above all other men have acknowledged the\nagreement.  'There is clear proof,' they will say, 'Socrates, that we and\nthe city were not displeasing to you.  Of all Athenians you have been the\nmost constant resident in the city, which, as you never leave, you may be\nsupposed to love (compare Phaedr.).  For you never went out of the city\neither to see the games, except once when you went to the Isthmus, or to\nany other place unless when you were on military service; nor did you\ntravel as other men do.  Nor had you any curiosity to know other states or\ntheir laws:  your affections did not go beyond us and our state; we were\nyour especial favourites, and you acquiesced in our government of you; and\nhere in this city you begat your children, which is a proof of your\nsatisfaction.  Moreover, you might in the course of the trial, if you had\nliked, have fixed the penalty at banishment; the state which refuses to let\nyou go now would have let you go then.  But you pretended that you\npreferred death to exile (compare Apol.), and that you were not unwilling\nto die.  And now you have forgotten these fine sentiments, and pay no\nrespect to us the laws, of whom you are the destroyer; and are doing what\nonly a miserable slave would do, running away and turning your back upon\nthe compacts and agreements which you made as a citizen.  And first of all\nanswer this very question:  Are we right in saying that you agreed to be\ngoverned according to us in deed, and not in word only?  Is that true or\nnot?'  How shall we answer, Crito?  Must we not assent?\n\nCRITO:  We cannot help it, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then will they not say:  'You, Socrates, are breaking the\ncovenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure, not in any\nhaste or under any compulsion or deception, but after you have had seventy\nyears to think of them, during which time you were at liberty to leave the\ncity, if we were not to your mind, or if our covenants appeared to you to\nbe unfair.  You had your choice, and might have gone either to Lacedaemon\nor Crete, both which states are often praised by you for their good\ngovernment, or to some other Hellenic or foreign state.  Whereas you, above\nall other Athenians, seemed to be so fond of the state, or, in other words,\nof us her laws (and who would care about a state which has no laws?), that\nyou never stirred out of her; the halt, the blind, the maimed, were not\nmore stationary in her than you were.  And now you run away and forsake\nyour agreements.  Not so, Socrates, if you will take our advice; do not\nmake yourself ridiculous by escaping out of the city.\n\n'For just consider, if you transgress and err in this sort of way, what\ngood will you do either to yourself or to your friends?  That your friends\nwill be driven into exile and deprived of citizenship, or will lose their\nproperty, is tolerably certain; and you yourself, if you fly to one of the\nneighbouring cities, as, for example, Thebes or Megara, both of which are\nwell governed, will come to them as an enemy, Socrates, and their\ngovernment will be against you, and all patriotic citizens will cast an\nevil eye upon you as a subverter of the laws, and you will confirm in the\nminds of the judges the justice of their own condemnation of you.  For he\nwho is a corrupter of the laws is more than likely to be a corrupter of the\nyoung and foolish portion of mankind.  Will you then flee from well-ordered\ncities and virtuous men? and is existence worth having on these terms?  Or\nwill you go to them without shame, and talk to them, Socrates?  And what\nwill you say to them?  What you say here about virtue and justice and\ninstitutions and laws being the best things among men?  Would that be\ndecent of you?  Surely not.  But if you go away from well-governed states\nto Crito's friends in Thessaly, where there is great disorder and licence,\nthey will be charmed to hear the tale of your escape from prison, set off\nwith ludicrous particulars of the manner in which you were wrapped in a\ngoatskin or some other disguise, and metamorphosed as the manner is of\nrunaways; but will there be no one to remind you that in your old age you\nwere not ashamed to violate the most sacred laws from a miserable desire of\na little more life?  Perhaps not, if you keep them in a good temper; but if\nthey are out of temper you will hear many degrading things; you will live,\nbut how?--as the flatterer of all men, and the servant of all men; and\ndoing what?--eating and drinking in Thessaly, having gone abroad in order\nthat you may get a dinner.  And where will be your fine sentiments about\njustice and virtue?  Say that you wish to live for the sake of your\nchildren--you want to bring them up and educate them--will you take them\ninto Thessaly and deprive them of Athenian citizenship?  Is this the\nbenefit which you will confer upon them?  Or are you under the impression\nthat they will be better cared for and educated here if you are still\nalive, although absent from them; for your friends will take care of them?\nDo you fancy that if you are an inhabitant of Thessaly they will take care\nof them, and if you are an inhabitant of the other world that they will not\ntake care of them?  Nay; but if they who call themselves friends are good\nfor anything, they will--to be sure they will.\n\n'Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up.  Think not of life\nand children first, and of justice afterwards, but of justice first, that\nyou may be justified before the princes of the world below.  For neither\nwill you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or juster in this\nlife, or happier in another, if you do as Crito bids.  Now you depart in\ninnocence, a sufferer and not a doer of evil; a victim, not of the laws,\nbut of men.  But if you go forth, returning evil for evil, and injury for\ninjury, breaking the covenants and agreements which you have made with us,\nand wronging those whom you ought least of all to wrong, that is to say,\nyourself, your friends, your country, and us, we shall be angry with you\nwhile you live, and our brethren, the laws in the world below, will receive\nyou as an enemy; for they will know that you have done your best to destroy\nus.  Listen, then, to us and not to Crito.'\n\nThis, dear Crito, is the voice which I seem to hear murmuring in my ears,\nlike the sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic; that voice, I say,\nis humming in my ears, and prevents me from hearing any other.  And I know\nthat anything more which you may say will be vain.  Yet speak, if you have\nanything to say.\n\nCRITO:  I have nothing to say, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Leave me then, Crito, to fulfil the will of God, and to follow\nwhither he leads.",

How Otto Saw the Great Emperor,\n\n\n\n\nFOREWORD.\n\nBetween the far away past history of the world, and that which lies near\nto us; in the time when the wisdom of the ancient times was dead and\nhad passed away, and our own days of light had not yet come, there lay a\ngreat black gulf in human history, a gulf of ignorance, of superstition,\nof cruelty, and of wickedness.\n\nThat time we call the dark or middle ages.\n\nFew records remain to us of that dreadful period in our world's history,\nand we only know of it through broken and disjointed fragments that have\nbeen handed down to us through the generations.\n\nYet, though the world's life then was so wicked and black, there yet\nremained a few good men and women here and there (mostly in peaceful\nand quiet monasteries, far from the thunder and the glare of the worlds\nbloody battle), who knew the right and the truth and lived according to\nwhat they knew; who preserved and tenderly cared for the truths that the\ndear Christ taught, and lived and died for in Palestine so long ago.\n\nThis tale that I am about to tell is of a little boy who lived and\nsuffered in those dark middle ages; of how he saw both the good and the\nbad of men, and of how, by gentleness and love and not by strife and\nhatred, he came at last to stand above other men and to be looked up to\nby all. And should you follow the story to the end, I hope you may find\nit a pleasure, as I have done, to ramble through those dark ancient\ncastles, to lie with little Otto and Brother John in the high\nbelfry-tower, or to sit with them in the peaceful quiet of the sunny\nold monastery garden, for, of all the story, I love best those early\npeaceful years that little Otto spent in the dear old White Cross on the\nHill.\n\nPoor little Otto's life was a stony and a thorny pathway, and it is well\nfor all of us nowadays that we walk it in fancy and not in truth.\n\n\n\n\nI. The Dragon's House.\n\nUp from the gray rocks, rising sheer and bold and bare, stood the walls\nand towers of Castle Drachenhausen. A great gate-way, with a heavy\niron-pointed portcullis hanging suspended in the dim arch above, yawned\nblackly upon the bascule or falling drawbridge that spanned a chasm\nbetween the blank stone walls and the roadway that winding down the\nsteep rocky slope to the little valley just beneath. There in the lap of\nthe hills around stood the wretched straw-thatched huts of the peasants\nbelonging to the castle--miserable serfs who, half timid, half fierce,\ntilled their poor patches of ground, wrenching from the hard soil barely\nenough to keep body and soul together. Among those vile hovels played\nthe little children like foxes about their dens, their wild, fierce eyes\npeering out from under a mat of tangled yellow hair.\n\nBeyond these squalid huts lay the rushing, foaming river, spanned by a\nhigh, rude, stone bridge where the road from the castle crossed it, and\nbeyond the river stretched the great, black forest, within whose gloomy\ndepths the savage wild beasts made their lair, and where in winter time\nthe howling wolves coursed their flying prey across the moonlit snow and\nunder the net-work of the black shadows from the naked boughs above.\n\nThe watchman in the cold, windy bartizan or watch-tower that clung to\nthe gray walls above the castle gateway, looked from his narrow window,\nwhere the wind piped and hummed, across the tree-tops that rolled in\nendless billows of green, over hill and over valley to the blue and\ndistant slope of the Keiserberg, where, on the mountain side, glimmered\nfar away the walls of Castle Trutz-Drachen.\n\nWithin the massive stone walls through which the gaping gateway led,\nthree great cheerless brick buildings, so forbidding that even the\nyellow sunlight could not light them into brightness, looked down, with\nrow upon row of windows, upon three sides of the bleak, stone courtyard.\nBack of and above them clustered a jumble of other buildings, tower and\nturret, one high-peaked roof overtopping another.\n\nThe great house in the centre was the Baron's Hall, the part to the left\nwas called the Roderhausen; between the two stood a huge square pile,\nrising dizzily up into the clear air high above the rest--the great\nMelchior Tower.\n\nAt the top clustered a jumble of buildings hanging high aloft in the\nwindy space a crooked wooden belfry, a tall, narrow watch-tower, and a\nrude wooden house that clung partly to the roof of the great tower and\npartly to the walls.\n\nFrom the chimney of this crazy hut a thin thread of smoke would now and\nthen rise into the air, for there were folk living far up in that empty,\nairy desert, and oftentimes wild, uncouth little children were seen\nplaying on the edge of the dizzy height, or sitting with their bare\nlegs hanging down over the sheer depths, as they gazed below at what was\ngoing on in the court-yard. There they sat, just as little children in\nthe town might sit upon their father's door-step; and as the sparrows\nmight fly around the feet of the little town children, so the circling\nflocks of rooks and daws flew around the feet of these air-born\ncreatures.\n\nIt was Schwartz Carl and his wife and little ones who lived far up there\nin the Melchior Tower, for it overlooked the top of the hill behind the\ncastle and so down into the valley upon the further side. There, day\nafter day, Schwartz Carl kept watch upon the gray road that ran like a\nribbon through the valley, from the rich town of Gruenstaldt to the rich\ntown of Staffenburgen, where passed merchant caravans from the one to\nthe other--for the lord of Drachenhausen was a robber baron.\n\nDong! Dong! The great alarm bell would suddenly ring out from the belfry\nhigh up upon the Melchior Tower. Dong! Dong! Till the rooks and daws\nwhirled clamoring and screaming. Dong! Dong! Till the fierce wolf-hounds\nin the rocky kennels behind the castle stables howled dismally in\nanswer. Dong! Dong!--Dong! Dong!\n\nThen would follow a great noise and uproar and hurry in the castle\ncourt-yard below; men shouting and calling to one another, the ringing\nof armor, and the clatter of horses' hoofs upon the hard stone. With the\ncreaking and groaning of the windlass the iron-pointed portcullis would\nbe slowly raised, and with a clank and rattle and clash of iron chains\nthe drawbridge would fall crashing. Then over it would thunder horse and\nman, clattering away down the winding, stony pathway, until the great\nforest would swallow them, and they would be gone.\n\nThen for a while peace would fall upon the castle courtyard, the cock\nwould crow, the cook would scold a lazy maid, and Gretchen, leaning out\nof a window, would sing a snatch of a song, just as though it were a\npeaceful farm-house, instead of a den of robbers.\n\nMaybe it would be evening before the men would return once more. Perhaps\none would have a bloody cloth bound about his head, perhaps one would\ncarry his arm in a sling; perhaps one--maybe more than one--would be\nleft behind, never to return again, and soon forgotten by all excepting\nsome poor woman who would weep silently in the loneliness of her daily\nwork.\n\nNearly always the adventurers would bring back with them pack-horses\nladen with bales of goods. Sometimes, besides these, they would return\nwith a poor soul, his hands tied behind his back and his feet beneath\nthe horse's body, his fur cloak and his flat cap wofully awry. A while\nhe would disappear in some gloomy cell of the dungeon-keep, until an\nenvoy would come from the town with a fat purse, when his ransom would\nbe paid, the dungeon would disgorge him, and he would be allowed to go\nupon his way again.\n\nOne man always rode beside Baron Conrad in his expeditions and\nadventures a short, deep-chested, broad-shouldered man, with sinewy arms\nso long that when he stood his hands hung nearly to his knees.\n\nHis coarse, close-clipped hair came so low upon his brow that only a\nstrip of forehead showed between it and his bushy, black eyebrows. One\neye was blind; the other twinkled and gleamed like a spark under the\npenthouse of his brows. Many folk said that the one-eyed Hans had drunk\nbeer with the Hill-man, who had given him the strength of ten, for he\ncould bend an iron spit like a hazel twig, and could lift a barrel of\nwine from the floor to his head as easily as though it were a basket of\neggs.\n\nAs for the one-eyed Hans he never said that he had not drunk beer with\nthe Hill-man, for he liked the credit that such reports gave him with\nthe other folk. And so, like a half savage mastiff, faithful to death\nto his master, but to him alone, he went his sullen way and lived his\nsullen life within the castle walls, half respected, half feared by the\nother inmates, for it was dangerous trifling with the one-eyed Hans.\n\n\n\n\nII. How the Baron went Forth to Shear.\n\nBaron Conrad and Baroness Matilda sat together at their morning meal\nbelow their raised seats stretched the long, heavy wooden table, loaded\nwith coarse food--black bread, boiled cabbage, bacon, eggs, a great\nchine from a wild boar, sausages, such as we eat nowadays, and flagons\nand jars of beer and wine, Along the board sat ranged in the order of\nthe household the followers and retainers. Four or five slatternly women\nand girls served the others as they fed noisily at the table, moving\nhere and there behind the men with wooden or pewter dishes of food, now\nand then laughing at the jests that passed or joining in the talk. A\nhuge fire blazed and crackled and roared in the great open fireplace,\nbefore which were stretched two fierce, shaggy, wolfish-looking hounds.\nOutside, the rain beat upon the roof or ran trickling from the eaves,\nand every now and then a chill draught of wind would breathe through the\nopen windows of the great black dining-hall and set the fire roaring.\n\nAlong the dull-gray wall of stone hung pieces of armor, and swords and\nlances, and great branching antlers of the stag. Overhead arched the\nrude, heavy, oaken beams, blackened with age and smoke, and underfoot\nwas a chill pavement of stone.\n\nUpon Baron Conrad's shoulder leaned the pale, slender, yellow-haired\nBaroness, the only one in all the world with whom the fierce lord of\nDrachenhausen softened to gentleness, the only one upon whom his savage\nbrows looked kindly, and to whom his harsh voice softened with love.\n\nThe Baroness was talking to her husband in a low voice, as he looked\ndown into her pale face, with its gentle blue eyes.\n\n\"And wilt thou not, then,\" said she, \"do that one thing for me?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" he growled, in his deep voice, \"I cannot promise thee never more\nto attack the towns-people in the valley over yonder. How else could I\nlive an' I did not take from the fat town hogs to fill our own larder?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Baroness, \"thou couldst live as some others do, for all\ndo not rob the burgher folk as thou dost. Alas! mishap will come upon\nthee some day, and if thou shouldst be slain, what then would come of\nme?\"\n\n\"Prut,\" said the Baron, \"thy foolish fears\" But he laid his rough, hairy\nhand softly upon the Baroness' head and stroked her yellow hair.\n\n\"For my sake, Conrad,\" whispered the Baroness.\n\nA pause followed. The Baron sat looking thoughtfully down into the\nBaroness' face. A moment more, and he might have promised what she\nbesought; a moment more, and he might have been saved all the bitter\ntrouble that was to follow. But it was not to be.\n\nSuddenly a harsh sound broke the quietness of all into a confusion of\nnoises. Dong! Dong!--it was the great alarm-bell from Melchior's Tower.\n\nThe Baron started at the sound. He sat for a moment or two with his hand\nclinched upon the arm of his seat as though about to rise, then he sunk\nback into his chair again.\n\nAll the others had risen tumultuously from the table, and now stood\nlooking at him, awaiting his orders.\n\n\"For my sake, Conrad,\" said the Baroness again.\n\nDong! Dong! rang the alarm-bell. The Baron sat with his eyes bent upon\nthe floor, scowling blackly.\n\nThe Baroness took his hand in both of hers. \"For my sake,\" she pleaded,\nand the tears filled her blue eyes as she looked up at him, \"do not go\nthis time.\"\n\nFrom the courtyard without came the sound of horses' hoofs clashing\nagainst the stone pavement, and those in the hall stood watching and\nwondering at this strange delay of the Lord Baron. Just then the door\nopened and one came pushing past the rest; it was the one-eyed Hans.\nHe came straight to where the Baron sat, and, leaning over, whispered\nsomething into his master's ear.\n\n\"For my sake,\" implored the Baroness again; but the scale was turned.\nThe Baron pushed back his chair heavily and rose to his feet. \"Forward!\"\nhe roared, in a voice of thunder, and a great shout went up in answer as\nhe strode clanking down the hall and out of the open door.\n\nThe Baroness covered her face with her hands and wept.\n\n\"Never mind, little bird,\" said old Ursela, the nurse, soothingly; \"he\nwill come back to thee again as he has come back to thee before.\"\n\nBut the poor young Baroness continued weeping with her face buried in\nher hands, because he had not done that thing she had asked.\n\nA white young face framed in yellow hair looked out into the courtyard\nfrom a window above; but if Baron Conrad of Drachenhausen saw it from\nbeneath the bars of his shining helmet, he made no sign.\n\n\"Forward,\" he cried again.\n\nDown thundered the drawbridge, and away they rode with clashing hoofs\nand ringing armor through the gray shroud of drilling rain.\n\nThe day had passed and the evening had come, and the Baroness and her\nwomen sat beside a roaring fire. All were chattering and talking and\nlaughing but two--the fair young Baroness and old Ursela; the one sat\nlistening, listening, listening, the other sat with her chin resting in\nthe palm of her hand, silently watching her young mistress. The night\nwas falling gray and chill, when suddenly the clear notes of a bugle\nrang from without the castle walls. The young Baroness started, and the\nrosy light flashed up into her pale cheeks.\n\n\"Yes, good,\" said old Ursela; \"the red fox has come back to his den\nagain, and I warrant he brings a fat town goose in his mouth; now we'll\nhave fine clothes to wear, and thou another gold chain to hang about thy\npretty neck.\"\n\nThe young Baroness laughed merrily at the old woman's speech. \"This\ntime,\" said she, \"I will choose a string of pearls like that one my aunt\nused to wear, and which I had about my neck when Conrad first saw me.\"\n\nMinute after minute passed; the Baroness sat nervously playing with a\nbracelet of golden beads about her wrist. \"How long he stays,\" said she.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ursela; \"but it is not cousin wish that holds him by the\ncoat.\"\n\nAs she spoke, a door banged in the passageway without, and the ring of\niron footsteps sounded upon the stone floor. Clank! Clank! Clank!\n\nThe Baroness rose to her feet, her face all alight. The door opened;\nthen the flush of joy faded away and the face grew white, white, white.\nOne hand clutched the back of the bench whereon she had been sitting,\nthe other hand pressed tightly against her side.\n\nIt was Hans the one-eyed who stood in the doorway, and black trouble sat\non his brow; all were looking at him waiting.\n\n\"Conrad,\" whispered the Baroness, at last. \"Where is Conrad? Where is\nyour master?\" and even her lips were white as she spoke.\n\nThe one-eyed Hans said nothing.\n\nJust then came the noise of men s voices in the corridor and the shuffle\nand scuffle of feet carrying a heavy load. Nearer and nearer they came,\nand one-eyed Hans stood aside. Six men came struggling through the\ndoorway, carrying a litter, and on the litter lay the great Baron\nConrad. The flaming torch thrust into the iron bracket against the wall\nflashed up with the draught of air from the open door, and the light\nfell upon the white face and the closed eyes, and showed upon his body\narmor a great red stain that was not the stain of rust.\n\nSuddenly Ursela cried out in a sharp, shrill voice, \"Catch her, she\nfalls!\"\n\nIt was the Baroness.\n\nThen the old crone turned fiercely upon the one-eyed Hans. \"Thou fool!\"\nshe cried, \"why didst thou bring him here? Thou hast killed thy lady!\"\n\n\"I did not know,\" said the one-eyed Hans, stupidly.\n\n\n\n\nIII. How the Baron came Home Shorn.\n\nBut Baron Conrad was not dead. For days he lay upon his hard bed, now\nmuttering incoherent words beneath his red beard, now raving fiercely\nwith the fever of his wound. But one day he woke again to the things\nabout him.\n\nHe turned his head first to the one side and then to the other; there\nsat Schwartz Carl and the one-eyed Hans. Two or three other retainers\nstood by a great window that looked out into the courtyard beneath,\njesting and laughing together in low tones, and one lay upon the heavy\noaken bench that stood along by the wall snoring in his sleep.\n\n\"Where is your lady?\" said the Baron, presently; \"and why is she not\nwith me at this time?\"\n\nThe man that lay upon the bench started up at the sound of his voice,\nand those at the window came hurrying to his bedside. But Schwartz Carl\nand the one-eyed Hans looked at one another, and neither of them spoke.\nThe Baron saw the look and in it read a certain meaning that brought\nhim to his elbow, though only to sink back upon his pillow again with a\ngroan.\n\n\"Why do you not answer me?\" said he at last, in a hollow voice; then\nto the one-eyed Hans, \"Hast no tongue, fool, that thou standest gaping\nthere like a fish? Answer me, where is thy mistress?\"\n\n\"I--I do not know,\" stammered poor Hans.\n\nFor a while the Baron lay silently looking from one face to the other,\nthen he spoke again. \"How long have I been lying here?\" said he.\n\n\"A sennight, my lord,\" said Master Rudolph, the steward, who had come\ninto the room and who now stood among the others at the bedside.\n\n\"A sennight,\" repeated the Baron, in a low voice, and then to Master\nRudolph, \"And has the Baroness been often beside me in that time?\"\nMaster Rudolph hesitated. \"Answer me,\" said the Baron, harshly.\n\n\"Not--not often,\" said Master Rudolph, hesitatingly.\n\nThe Baron lay silent for a long time. At last he passed his hands over\nhis face and held them there for a minute, then of a sudden, before\nanyone knew what he was about to do, he rose upon his elbow and then sat\nupright upon the bed. The green wound broke out afresh and a dark red\nspot grew and spread upon the linen wrappings; his face was drawn and\nhaggard with the pain of his moving, and his eyes wild and bloodshot.\nGreat drops of sweat gathered and stood upon his forehead as he sat\nthere swaying slightly from side to side.\n\n\"My shoes,\" said he, hoarsely.\n\nMaster Rudolph stepped forward. \"But, my Lord Baron,\" he began and then\nstopped short, for the Baron shot him such a look that his tongue stood\nstill in his head.\n\nHans saw that look out of his one eye. Down he dropped upon his knees\nand, fumbling under the bed, brought forth a pair of soft leathern\nshoes, which he slipped upon the Baron's feet and then laced the thongs\nabove the instep.\n\n\"Your shoulder,\" said the Baron. He rose slowly to his feet, gripping\nHans in the stress of his agony until the fellow winced again. For a\nmoment he stood as though gathering strength, then doggedly started\nforth upon that quest which he had set upon himself.\n\nAt the door he stopped for a moment as though overcome by his weakness,\nand there Master Nicholas, his cousin, met him; for the steward had sent\none of the retainers to tell the old man what the Baron was about to do.\n\n\"Thou must go back again, Conrad,\" said Master Nicholas; \"thou art not\nfit to be abroad.\"\n\nThe Baron answered him never a word, but he glared at him from out of\nhis bloodshot eyes and ground his teeth together. Then he started forth\nagain upon his way.\n\nDown the long hall he went, slowly and laboriously, the others following\nsilently behind him, then up the steep winding stairs, step by step,\nnow and then stopping to lean against the wall. So he reached a long\nand gloomy passageway lit only by the light of a little window at the\nfurther end.\n\nHe stopped at the door of one of the rooms that opened into this\npassage-way, stood for a moment, then he pushed it open.\n\nNo one was within but old Ursela, who sat crooning over a fire with a\nbundle upon her knees. She did not see the Baron or know that he was\nthere.\n\n\"Where is your lady?\" said he, in a hollow voice.\n\nThen the old nurse looked up with a start. \"Jesu bless us,\" cried she,\nand crossed herself.\n\n\"Where is your lady?\" said the Baron again, in the same hoarse voice;\nand then, not waiting for an answer, \"Is she dead?\"\n\nThe old woman looked at him for a minute blinking her watery eyes, and\nthen suddenly broke into a shrill, long-drawn wail. The Baron needed to\nhear no more.\n\nAs though in answer to the old woman's cry, a thin piping complaint came\nfrom the bundle in her lap.\n\nAt the sound the red blood flashed up into the Baron's face. \"What\nis that you have there?\" said he, pointing to the bundle upon the old\nwoman's knees.\n\nShe drew back the coverings and there lay a poor, weak, little baby,\nthat once again raised its faint reedy pipe.\n\n\"It is your son,\" said Ursela, \"that the dear Baroness left behind her\nwhen the holy angels took her to Paradise. She blessed him and called\nhim Otto before she left us.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV. The White Cross on the Hill.\n\nHere the glassy waters of the River Rhine, holding upon its bosom a\nmimic picture of the blue sky and white clouds floating above, runs\nsmoothly around a jutting point of land, St. Michaelsburg, rising from\nthe reedy banks of the stream, sweeps up with a smooth swell until\nit cuts sharp and clear against the sky. Stubby vineyards covered its\nearthy breast, and field and garden and orchard crowned its brow, where\nlay the Monastery of St. Michaelsburg--\"The White Cross on the Hill.\"\nThere within the white walls, where the warm yellow sunlight slept, all\nwas peaceful quietness, broken only now and then by the crowing of\nthe cock or the clamorous cackle of a hen, the lowing of kine or the\nbleating of goats, a solitary voice in prayer, the faint accord of\ndistant singing, or the resonant toll of the monastery bell from the\nhigh-peaked belfry that overlooked the hill and valley and the smooth,\nfar-winding stream. No other sounds broke the stillness, for in this\npeaceful haven was never heard the clash of armor, the ring of iron-shod\nhoofs, or the hoarse call to arms.\n\nAll men were not wicked and cruel and fierce in that dark, far-away age;\nall were not robbers and terror-spreading tyrants, even in that time\nwhen men's hands were against their neighbors, and war and rapine dwelt\nin place of peace and justice.\n\nAbbot Otto, of St. Michaelsburg, was a gentle, patient, pale-faced old\nman; his white hands were soft and smooth, and no one would have thought\nthat they could have known the harsh touch of sword-hilt and lance. And\nyet, in the days of the Emperor Frederick--the grandson of the great\nRed-beard--no one stood higher in the prowess of arms than he. But all\nat once--for why, no man could tell--a change came over him, and in the\nflower of his youth and fame and growing power he gave up everything\nin life and entered the quiet sanctuary of that white monastery on the\nhill-side, so far away from the tumult and the conflict of the world in\nwhich he had lived.\n\nSome said that it was because the lady he had loved had loved his\nbrother, and that when they were married Otto of Wolbergen had left the\nchurch with a broken heart.\n\nBut such stories are old songs that have been sung before.\n\nClatter! clatter! Jingle! jingle! It was a full-armed knight that came\nriding up the steep hill road that wound from left to right and right to\nleft amid the vineyards on the slopes of St. Michaelsburg. Polished helm\nand corselet blazed in the noon sunlight, for no knight in those days\ndared to ride the roads except in full armor. In front of him the\nsolitary knight carried a bundle wrapped in the folds of his coarse gray\ncloak.\n\nIt was a sorely sick man that rode up the heights of St. Michaelsburg.\nHis head hung upon his breast through the faintness of weariness and\npain; for it was the Baron Conrad.\n\nHe had left his bed of sickness that morning, had saddled his horse in\nthe gray dawn with his own hands, and had ridden away into the misty\ntwilight of the forest without the knowledge of anyone excepting the\nporter, who, winking and blinking in the bewilderment of his broken\nslumber, had opened the gates to the sick man, hardly knowing what he\nwas doing, until he beheld his master far away, clattering down the\nsteep bridle-path.\n\nEight leagues had he ridden that day with neither a stop nor a stay; but\nnow at last the end of his journey had come, and he drew rein under the\nshade of the great wooden gateway of St. Michaelsburg.\n\nHe reached up to the knotted rope and gave it a pull, and from within\nsounded the answering ring of the porter's bell. By and by a little\nwicket opened in the great wooden portals, and the gentle, wrinkled face\nof old Brother Benedict, the porter, peeped out at the strange iron-clad\nvisitor and the great black war-horse, streaked and wet with the sweat\nof the journey, flecked and dappled with flakes of foam. A few words\npassed between them, and then the little window was closed again; and\nwithin, the shuffling pat of the sandalled feet sounded fainter and\nfainter, as Brother Benedict bore the message from Baron Conrad to Abbot\nOtto, and the mail-clad figure was left alone, sitting there as silent\nas a statue.\n\nBy and by the footsteps sounded again; there came a noise of clattering\nchains and the rattle of the key in the lock, and the rasping of the\nbolts dragged back. Then the gate swung slowly open, and Baron Conrad\nrode into the shelter of the White Cross, and as the hoofs of his\nwar-horse clashed upon the stones of the courtyard within, the wooden\ngate swung slowly to behind him.\n\nAbbot Otto stood by the table when Baron Conrad entered the high-vaulted\nroom from the farther end. The light from the oriel window behind the\nold man shed broken rays of light upon him, and seemed to frame his thin\ngray hairs with a golden glory. His white, delicate hand rested upon the\ntable beside him, and upon some sheets of parchment covered with rows of\nancient Greek writing which he had been engaged in deciphering.\n\nClank! clank! clank! Baron Conrad strode across the stone floor, and\nthen stopped short in front of the good old man.\n\n\"What dost thou seek here, my son?\" said the Abbot.\n\n\"I seek sanctuary for my son and thy brother's grandson,\" said the Baron\nConrad, and he flung back the folds of his cloak and showed the face of\nthe sleeping babe.\n\nFor a while the Abbot said nothing, but stood gazing dreamily at\nthe baby. After a while he looked up. \"And the child's mother,\" said\nhe--\"what hath she to say at this?\"\n\n\"She hath naught to say,\" said Baron Conrad, hoarsely, and then stopped\nshort in his speech. \"She is dead,\" said he, at last, in a husky voice,\n\"and is with God's angels in paradise.\"\n\nThe Abbot looked intently in the Baron's face. \"So!\" said he, under his\nbreath, and then for the first time noticed how white and drawn was the\nBaron's face. \"Art sick thyself?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ay,\" said the Baron, \"I have come from death's door. But that is no\nmatter. Wilt thou take this little babe into sanctuary? My house is a\nvile, rough place, and not fit for such as he, and his mother with the\nblessed saints in heaven.\" And once more Conrad of Drachenhausen's face\nbegan twitching with the pain of his thoughts.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man, gently, \"he shall live here,\" and he stretched\nout his hands and took the babe. \"Would,\" said he, \"that all the little\nchildren in these dark times might be thus brought to the house of God,\nand there learn mercy and peace, instead of rapine and war.\"\n\nFor a while he stood looking down in silence at the baby in his arms,\nbut with his mind far away upon other things. At last he roused himself\nwith a start. \"And thou,\" said he to the Baron Conrad--\"hath not thy\nheart been chastened and softened by this? Surely thou wilt not go back\nto thy old life of rapine and extortion?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Baron Conrad, gruffly, \"I will rob the city swine no longer,\nfor that was the last thing that my dear one asked of me.\"\n\nThe old Abbot's face lit up with a smile. \"I am right glad that thy\nheart was softened, and that thou art willing at last to cease from war\nand violence.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" cried the Baron, roughly, \"I said nothing of ceasing from war. By\nheaven, no! I will have revenge!\" And he clashed his iron foot upon the\nfloor and clinched his fists and ground his teeth together. \"Listen,\"\nsaid he, \"and I will tell thee how my troubles happened. A fortnight ago\nI rode out upon an expedition against a caravan of fat burghers in the\nvalley of Gruenhoffen. They outnumbered us many to one, but city swine\nsuch as they are not of the stuff to stand against our kind for a long\ntime. Nevertheless, while the men-at-arms who guarded the caravan were\nstaying us with pike and cross-bow from behind a tree which they had\nfelled in front of a high bridge the others had driven the pack-horses\noff, so that by the time we had forced the bridge they were a league\nor more away. We pushed after them as hard as we were able, but when we\ncame up with them we found that they had been joined by Baron Frederick\nof Trutz-Drachen, to whom for three years and more the burghers of\nGruenstadt have been paying a tribute for his protection against others.\nThen again they made a stand, and this time the Baron Frederick himself\nwas with them. But though the dogs fought well, we were forcing them\nback, and might have got the better of them, had not my horse stumbled\nupon a sloping stone, and so fell and rolled over upon me. While I lay\nthere with my horse upon me, Baron Frederick ran me down with his lance,\nand gave me that foul wound that came so near to slaying me--and did\nslay my dear wife. Nevertheless, my men were able to bring me out from\nthat press and away, and we had bitten the Trutz-Drachen dogs so deep\nthat they were too sore to follow us, and so let us go our way in peace.\nBut when those fools of mine brought me to my castle they bore me lying\nupon a litter to my wife's chamber. There she beheld me, and, thinking\nme dead, swooned a death-swoon, so that she only lived long enough to\nbless her new-born babe and name it Otto, for you, her father's brother.\nBut, by heavens! I will have revenge, root and branch, upon that vile\ntribe, the Roderburgs of Trutz-Drachen. Their great-grandsire built that\ncastle in scorn of Baron Casper in the old days; their grandsire slew my\nfather's grandsire; Baron Nicholas slew two of our kindred; and now this\nBaron Frederick gives me that foul wound and kills my dear wife through\nmy body.\" Here the Baron stopped short; then of a sudden, shaking his\nfist above his head, he cried out in his hoarse voice: \"I swear by all\nthe saints in heaven, either the red cock shall crow over the roof of\nTrutz-Drachen or else it shall crow over my house! The black dog shall\nsit on Baron Frederick's shoulders or else he shall sit on mine!\" Again\nhe stopped, and fixing his blazing eyes upon the old man, \"Hearest thou\nthat, priest?\" said he, and broke into a great boisterous laugh.\n\nAbbot Otto sighed heavily, but he tried no further to persuade the other\ninto different thoughts.\n\n\"Thou art wounded,\" said he, at last, in a gentle voice; \"at least stay\nhere with us until thou art healed.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Baron, roughly, \"I will tarry no longer than to hear\nthee promise to care for my child.\"\n\n\"I promise,\" said the Abbot; \"but lay aside thy armor, and rest.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Baron, \"I go back again to-day.\"\n\nAt this the Abbot cried out in amazement: \"Sure thou, wounded man, would\nnot take that long journey without a due stay for resting! Think! Night\nwill be upon thee before thou canst reach home again, and the forests\nare beset with wolves.\"\n\nThe Baron laughed. \"Those are not the wolves I fear,\" said he. \"Urge me\nno further, I must return to-night; yet if thou hast a mind to do me a\nkindness thou canst give me some food to eat and a flask of your golden\nMichaelsburg; beyond these, I ask no further favor of any man, be he\npriest or layman.\"\n\n\"What comfort I can give thee thou shalt have,\" said the Abbot, in his\npatient voice, and so left the room to give the needful orders, bearing\nthe babe with him.\n\n\n\n\nV. How Otto Dwelt at St. Michaelsburg.\n\nSo the poor, little, motherless waif lived among the old monks at the\nWhite Cross on the hill, thriving and growing apace until he had reached\neleven or twelve years of age; a slender, fair-haired little fellow,\nwith a strange, quiet serious manner.\n\n\"Poor little child!\" Old Brother Benedict would sometimes say to the\nothers, \"poor little child! The troubles in which he was born must have\nbroken his wits like a glass cup. What think ye he said to me to-day?\n'Dear Brother Benedict,' said he, 'dost thou shave the hair off of the\ntop of thy head so that the dear God may see thy thoughts the better?'\nThink of that now!\" and the good old man shook with silent laughter.\n\nWhen such talk came to the good Father Abbot's ears, he smiled quietly\nto himself. \"It may be,\" said he, \"that the wisdom of little children\nflies higher than our heavy wits can follow.\"\n\nAt least Otto was not slow with his studies, and Brother Emmanuel,\nwho taught him his lessons, said more than once that, if his wits were\ncracked in other ways, they were sound enough in Latin.\n\nOtto, in a quaint, simple way which belonged to him, was gentle\nand obedient to all. But there was one among the Brethren of St.\nMichaelsburg whom he loved far above all the rest--Brother John, a poor\nhalf-witted fellow, of some twenty-five or thirty years of age. When\na very little child, he had fallen from his nurse's arms and hurt his\nhead, and as he grew up into boyhood, and showed that his wits had been\naddled by his fall, his family knew not what else to do with him, and\nso sent him off to the Monastery of St. Michaelsburg, where he lived\nhis simple, witless life upon a sort of sufferance, as though he were a\ntame, harmless animal.\n\nWhile Otto was still a little baby, he had been given into Brother\nJohn's care. Thereafter, and until Otto had grown old enough to care for\nhimself, poor Brother John never left his little charge, night or day.\nOftentimes the good Father Abbot, coming into the garden, where he loved\nto walk alone in his meditations, would find the poor, simple Brother\nsitting under the shade of the pear-tree, close to the bee-hives,\nrocking the little baby in his arms, singing strange, crazy songs to\nit, and gazing far away into the blue, empty sky with his curious, pale\neyes.\n\nAlthough, as Otto grew up into boyhood, his lessons and his tasks\nseparated him from Brother John, the bond between them seemed to grow\nstronger rather than weaker. During the hours that Otto had for his own\nthey were scarcely ever apart. Down in the vineyard, where the monks\nwere gathering the grapes for the vintage, in the garden, or in the\nfields, the two were always seen together, either wandering hand in\nhand, or seated in some shady nook or corner.\n\nBut most of all they loved to lie up in the airy wooden belfry; the\ngreat gaping bell hanging darkly above them, the mouldering cross-beams\nglimmering far up under the dim shadows of the roof, where dwelt a great\nbrown owl that, unfrightened at their familiar presence, stared down at\nthem with his round, solemn eyes. Below them stretched the white walls\nof the garden, beyond them the vineyard, and beyond that again the far\nshining river, that seemed to Otto's mind to lead into wonder-land.\nThere the two would lie upon the belfry floor by the hour, talking\ntogether of the strangest things.\n\n\"I saw the dear Angel Gabriel again yester morn,\" said Brother John.\n\n\"So!\" says Otto, seriously; \"and where was that?\"\n\n\"It was out in the garden, in the old apple-tree,\" said Brother John. \"I\nwas walking there, and my wits were running around in the grass like a\nmouse. What heard I but a wonderful sound of singing, and it was like\nthe hum of a great bee, only sweeter than honey. So I looked up into the\ntree, and there I saw two sparks. I thought at first that they were\ntwo stars that had fallen out of heaven; but what think you they were,\nlittle child?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Otto, breathlessly.\n\n\"They were angel's eyes,\" said Brother John; and he smiled in the\nstrangest way, as he gazed up into the blue sky. \"So I looked at the two\nsparks and felt happy, as one does in spring time when the cold weather\nis gone, and the warm sun shines, and the cuckoo sings again. Then,\nby-and-by, I saw the face to which the eyes belonged. First, it shone\nwhite and thin like the moon in the daylight; but it grew brighter and\nbrighter, until it hurt one's eyes to look at it, as though it had been\nthe blessed sun itself. Angel Gabriel's hand was as white as silver, and\nin it he held a green bough with blossoms, like those that grow on the\nthorn bush. As for his robe, it was all of one piece, and finer than the\nFather Abbot's linen, and shone beside like the sunlight on pure snow.\nSo I knew from all these things that it was the blessed Angel Gabriel.\"\n\n\"What do they say about this tree, Brother John?\" said he to me.\n\n\"They say it is dying, my Lord Angel,\" said I, \"and that the gardener\nwill bring a sharp axe and cut it down.\"\n\n\"'And what dost thou say about it, Brother John?' said he.\"\n\n\"'I also say yes, and that it is dying,' said I.\"\n\n\"At that he smiled until his face shone so bright that I had to shut my\neyes.\"\n\n\"'Now I begin to believe, Brother John, that thou art as foolish as men\nsay,' said he. 'Look, till I show thee.' And thereat I opened mine eyes\nagain.\"\n\n\"Then Angel Gabriel touched the dead branches with the flowery twig that\nhe held in his hand, and there was the dead wood all covered with green\nleaves, and fair blossoms and beautiful apples as yellow as gold. Each\nsmelling more sweetly than a garden of flowers, and better to the taste\nthan white bread and honey.\n\n\"'They are souls of the apples,' said the good Angel,' and they can\nnever wither and die.'\n\n\"'Then I'll tell the gardener that he shall not cut the tree down,' said\nI.\"\n\n\"'No, no,' said the dear Gabriel, 'that will never do, for if the tree\nis not cut down here on the earth, it can never be planted in paradise.'\"\n\nHere Brother John stopped short in his story, and began singing one of\nhis crazy songs, as he gazed with his pale eyes far away into nothing at\nall.\n\n\"But tell me, Brother John,\" said little Otto, in a hushed voice, \"what\nelse did the good Angel say to thee?\"\n\nBrother John stopped short in his song and began looking from right to\nleft, and up and down, as though to gather his wits.\n\n\"So!\" said he, \"there was something else that he told me. Tschk! If I\ncould but think now. Yes, good! This is it--'Nothing that has lived,'\nsaid he, 'shall ever die, and nothing that has died shall ever live.'\"\n\nOtto drew a deep breath. \"I would that I might see the beautiful Angel\nGabriel sometime,\" said he; but Brother John was singing again and did\nnot seem to hear what he said.\n\nNext to Brother John, the nearest one to the little child was the good\nAbbot Otto, for though he had never seen wonderful things with the eyes\nof his soul, such as Brother John's had beheld, and so could not tell of\nthem, he was yet able to give little Otto another pleasure that no one\nelse could give.\n\nHe was a great lover of books, the old Abbot, and had under lock and key\nwonderful and beautiful volumes, bound in hog-skin and metal, and with\ncovers inlaid with carved ivory, or studded with precious stones. But\nwithin these covers, beautiful as they were, lay the real wonder of the\nbooks, like the soul in the body; for there, beside the black letters\nand initials, gay with red and blue and gold, were beautiful pictures\npainted upon the creamy parchment. Saints and Angels, the Blessed Virgin\nwith the golden oriole about her head, good St. Joseph, the three Kings;\nthe simple Shepherds kneeling in the fields, while Angels with glories\nabout their brow called to the poor Peasants from the blue sky above.\nBut, most beautiful of all was the picture of the Christ Child lying in\nthe manger, with the mild-eyed Kine gazing at him.\n\nSometimes the old Abbot would unlock the iron-bound chest where these\ntreasures lay hidden, and carefully and lovingly brushing the few grains\nof dust from them, would lay them upon the table beside the oriel window\nin front of his little namesake, allowing the little boy freedom to turn\nthe leaves as he chose.\n\nAlways it was one picture that little Otto sought; the Christ Child in\nthe manger, with the Virgin, St. Joseph, the Shepherds, and the Kine.\nAnd as he would hang breathlessly gazing and gazing upon it, the old\nAbbot would sit watching him with a faint, half-sad smile flickering\naround his thin lips and his pale, narrow face.\n\nIt was a pleasant, peaceful life, but by-and-by the end came. Otto was\nnow nearly twelve years old.\n\nOne bright, clear day, near the hour of noon, little Otto heard the\nporter's bell sounding below in the court-yard--dong! dong! Brother\nEmmanuel had been appointed as the boy's instructor, and just then Otto\nwas conning his lessons in the good monk's cell. Nevertheless, at the\nsound of the bell he pricked up his ears and listened, for a visitor was\na strange matter in that out-of-the-way place, and he wondered who it\ncould be. So, while his wits wandered his lessons lagged.\n\n\"Postera Phoeba lustrabat lampade terras,\" continued Brother Emmanuel,\ninexorably running his horny finger-nail beneath the line, \"humentemque\nAurora polo dimoverat umbram--\" the lesson dragged along.\n\nJust then a sandaled footstep sounded without, in the stone corridor,\nand a light tap fell upon Brother Emmanuel's door. It was Brother\nIgnatius, and the Abbot wished little Otto to come to the refectory.\n\nAs they crossed the court-yard Otto stared to see a group of mail-clad\nmen-at-arms, some sitting upon their horses, some standing by the\nsaddle-bow. \"Yonder is the young baron,\" he heard one of them say in a\ngruff voice, and thereupon all turned and stared at him.\n\nA stranger was in the refectory, standing beside the good old Abbot,\nwhile food and wine were being brought and set upon the table for his\nrefreshment; a great, tall, broad-shouldered man, beside whom the Abbot\nlooked thinner and slighter than ever.\n\nThe stranger was clad all in polished and gleaming armor, of plate and\nchain, over which was drawn a loose robe of gray woollen stuff, reaching\nto the knees and bound about the waist by a broad leathern sword-belt.\nUpon his arm he carried a great helmet which he had just removed from\nhis head. His face was weather-beaten and rugged, and on lip and chin\nwas a wiry, bristling beard; once red, now frosted with white.\n\nBrother Ignatius had bidden Otto to enter, and had then closed the door\nbehind him; and now, as the lad walked slowly up the long room, he gazed\nwith round, wondering blue eyes at the stranger.\n\n\"Dost know who I am, Otto? said the mail-clad knight, in a deep,\ngrowling voice.\n\n\"Methinks you are my father, sir,\" said Otto.\n\n\"Aye, thou art right,\" said Baron Conrad, \"and I am glad to see that\nthese milk-churning monks have not allowed thee to forget me, and who\nthou art thyself.\"\n\n\"An' it please you,\" said Otto, \"no one churneth milk here but\nBrother Fritz; we be makers of wine and not makers of butter, at St.\nMichaelsburg.\"\n\nBaron Conrad broke into a great, loud laugh, but Abbot Otto's sad and\nthoughtful face lit up with no shadow of an answering smile.\n\n\"Conrad,\" said he, turning to the other, \"again let me urge thee; do\nnot take the child hence, his life can never be your life, for he is not\nfitted for it. I had thought,\" said he, after a moment's pause, \"I had\nthought that thou hadst meant to consecrate him--this motherless one--to\nthe care of the Universal Mother Church.\"\n\n\"So!\" said the Baron, \"thou hadst thought that, hadst thou? Thou hadst\nthought that I had intended to deliver over this boy, the last of the\nVuelphs, to the arms of the Church? What then was to become of our name\nand the glory of our race if it was to end with him in a monastery? No,\nDrachenhausen is the home of the Vuelphs, and there the last of the race\nshall live as his sires have lived before him, holding to his rights by\nthe power and the might of his right hand.\"\n\nThe Abbot turned and looked at the boy, who was gaping in simple\nwide-eyed wonderment from one to the other as they spoke.\n\n\"And dost thou think, Conrad,\" said the old man, in his gentle, patient\nvoice, \"that that poor child can maintain his rights by the strength of\nhis right hand?\"\n\nThe Baron's look followed the Abbot's, and he said nothing.\n\nIn the few seconds of silence that followed, little Otto, in his simple\nmind, was wondering what all this talk portended. Why had his father\ncome hither to St. Michaelsburg, lighting up the dim silence of the\nmonastery with the flash and ring of his polished armor? Why had he\ntalked about churning butter but now, when all the world knew that the\nmonks of St. Michaelsburg made wine.\n\nIt was Baron Conrad's deep voice that broke the little pause of silence.\n\n\"If you have made a milkmaid of the boy,\" he burst out at last, \"I thank\nthe dear heaven that there is yet time to undo your work and to make a\nman of him.\"\n\nThe Abbot sighed. \"The child is yours, Conrad,\" said he, \"the will of\nthe blessed saints be done. Mayhap if he goes to dwell at Drachenhausen\nhe may make you the better instead of you making him the worse.\"\n\nThen light came to the darkness of little Otto's wonderment; he saw what\nall this talk meant and why his father had come hither. He was to leave\nthe happy, sunny silence of the dear White Cross, and to go out into\nthat great world that he had so often looked down upon from the high\nwindy belfry on the steep hillside.\n\n\n\n\nVI. How Otto Lived in the Dragon's House.\n\nThe gates of the Monastery stood wide open, the world lay beyond, and\nall was ready for departure. Baron Conrad and his men-at-arms sat foot\nin stirrup, the milk-white horse that had been brought for Otto stood\nwaiting for him beside his father's great charger.\n\n\"Farewell, Otto,\" said the good old Abbot, as he stooped and kissed the\nboy's cheek.\n\n\"Farewell,\" answered Otto, in his simple, quiet way, and it brought\na pang to the old man's heart that the child should seem to grieve so\nlittle at the leave-taking.\n\n\"Farewell, Otto,\" said the brethren that stood about, \"farewell,\nfarewell.\"\n\nThen poor brother John came forward and took the boy's hand, and looked\nup into his face as he sat upon his horse. \"We will meet again,\" said\nhe, with his strange, vacant smile, \"but maybe it will be in Paradise,\nand there perhaps they will let us lie in the father's belfry, and look\ndown upon the angels in the court-yard below.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" answered Otto, with an answering smile.\n\n\"Forward,\" cried the Baron, in a deep voice, and with a clash of hoofs\nand jingle of armor they were gone, and the great wooden gates were shut\nto behind them.\n\nDown the steep winding pathway they rode, and out into the great wide\nworld beyond, upon which Otto and brother John had gazed so often from\nthe wooden belfry of the White Cross on the hill.\n\n\"Hast been taught to ride a horse by the priests up yonder on\nMichaelsburg?\" asked the Baron, when they had reached the level road.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto; \"we had no horse to ride, but only to bring in the\nharvest or the grapes from the further vineyards to the vintage.\"\n\n\"Prut,\" said the Baron, \"methought the abbot would have had enough of\nthe blood of old days in his veins to have taught thee what is fitting\nfor a knight to know; art not afeared?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto, with a smile, \"I am not afeared.\"\n\n\"There at least thou showest thyself a Vuelph,\" said the grim Baron. But\nperhaps Otto's thought of fear and Baron Conrad's thought of fear were\ntwo very different matters.\n\nThe afternoon had passed by the time they had reached the end of their\njourney. Up the steep, stony path they rode to the drawbridge and\nthe great gaping gateway of Drachenhausen, where wall and tower and\nbattlement looked darker and more forbidding than ever in the gray\ntwilight of the coming night. Little Otto looked up with great,\nwondering, awe-struck eyes at this grim new home of his.\n\nThe next moment they clattered over the drawbridge that spanned the\nnarrow black gulph between the roadway and the wall, and the next were\npast the echoing arch of the great gateway and in the gray gloaming of\nthe paved court-yard within.\n\nOtto looked around upon the many faces gathered there to catch the\nfirst sight of the little baron; hard, rugged faces, seamed and\nweather-beaten; very different from those of the gentle brethren among\nwhom he had lived, and it seemed strange to him that there was none\nthere whom he should know.\n\nAs he climbed the steep, stony steps to the door of the Baron's house,\nold Ursela came running down to meet him. She flung her withered arms\naround him and hugged him close to her. \"My little child,\" she cried,\nand then fell to sobbing as though her heart would break.\n\n\"Here is someone knoweth me,\" thought the little boy.\n\nHis new home was all very strange and wonderful to Otto; the armors, the\ntrophies, the flags, the long galleries with their ranges of rooms,\nthe great hall below with its vaulted roof and its great fireplace of\ngrotesquely carved stone, and all the strange people with their lives\nand thoughts so different from what he had been used to know.\n\nAnd it was a wonderful thing to explore all the strange places in the\ndark old castle; places where it seemed to Otto no one could have ever\nbeen before.\n\nOnce he wandered down a long, dark passageway below the hall, pushed\nopen a narrow, iron-bound oaken door, and found himself all at once in\na strange new land; the gray light, coming in through a range of tall,\nnarrow windows, fell upon a row of silent, motionless figures carven in\nstone, knights and ladies in strange armor and dress; each lying upon\nhis or her stony couch with clasped hands, and gazing with fixed,\nmotionless, stony eyeballs up into the gloomy, vaulted arch above them.\nThere lay, in a cold, silent row, all of the Vuelphs who had died since\nthe ancient castle had been built.\n\nIt was the chapel into which Otto had made his way, now long since\nfallen out of use excepting as a burial place of the race.\n\nAt another time he clambered up into the loft under the high peaked\nroof, where lay numberless forgotten things covered with the dim dust\nof years. There a flock of pigeons had made their roost, and flapped\nnoisily out into the sunlight when he pushed open the door from below.\nHere he hunted among the mouldering things of the past until, oh, joy\nof joys! in an ancient oaken chest he found a great lot of worm-eaten\nbooks, that had belonged to some old chaplain of the castle in days gone\nby. They were not precious and beautiful volumes, such as the Father\nAbbot had showed him, but all the same they had their quaint painted\npictures of the blessed saints and angels.\n\nAgain, at another time, going into the court-yard, Otto had found\nthe door of Melchior's tower standing invitingly open, for old Hilda,\nSchwartz Carl's wife, had come down below upon some business or other.\n\nThen upon the shaky wooden steps Otto ran without waiting for a second\nthought, for he had often gazed at those curious buildings hanging so\nfar up in the air, and had wondered what they were like. Round and round\nand up and up Otto climbed, until his head spun. At last he reached\na landing-stage, and gazing over the edge and down, beheld the stone\npavement far, far below, lit by a faint glimmer of light that entered\nthrough the arched doorway. Otto clutched tight hold of the wooden rail,\nhe had no thought that he had climbed so far.\n\nUpon the other side of the landing was a window that pierced the thick\nstone walls of the tower; out of the window he looked, and then drew\nsuddenly back again with a gasp, for it was through the outer wall he\npeered, and down, down below in the dizzy depths he saw the hard\ngray rocks, where the black swine, looking no larger than ants in the\ndistance, fed upon the refuse thrown out over the walls of the castle.\nThere lay the moving tree-tops like a billowy green sea, and the coarse\nthatched roofs of the peasant cottages, round which crawled the little\nchildren like tiny human specks.\n\nThen Otto turned and crept down the stairs, frightened at the height to\nwhich he had climbed.\n\nAt the doorway he met Mother Hilda. \"Bless us,\" she cried, starting back\nand crossing herself, and then, seeing who it was, ducked him a courtesy\nwith as pleasant a smile as her forbidding face, with its little\ndeep-set eyes, was able to put upon itself.\n\nOld Ursela seemed nearer to the boy than anyone else about the castle,\nexcepting it was his father, and it was a newfound delight to Otto to\nsit beside her and listen to her quaint stories, so different from the\nmonkish tales that he had heard and read at the monastery.\n\nBut one day it was a tale of a different sort that she told him, and one\nthat opened his eyes to what he had never dreamed of before.\n\nThe mellow sunlight fell through the window upon old Ursela, as she sat\nin the warmth with her distaff in her hands while Otto lay close to her\nfeet upon a bear skin, silently thinking over the strange story of a\nbrave knight and a fiery dragon that she had just told him. Suddenly\nUrsela broke the silence.\n\n\"Little one,\" said she, \"thou art wondrously like thy own dear mother;\ndidst ever hear how she died?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto, \"but tell me, Ursela, how it was.\"\n\n\"Tis strange,\" said the old woman, \"that no one should have told thee\nin all this time.\" And then, in her own fashion she related to him the\nstory of how his father had set forth upon that expedition in spite of\nall that Otto's mother had said, beseeching him to abide at home; how he\nhad been foully wounded, and how the poor lady had died from her fright\nand grief.\n\nOtto listened with eyes that grew wider and wider, though not all with\nwonder; he no longer lay upon the bear skin, but sat up with his hands\nclasped. For a moment or two after the old woman had ended her story, he\nsat staring silently at her. Then he cried out, in a sharp voice, \"And\nis this truth that you tell me, Ursela? and did my father seek to rob\nthe towns people of their goods?\"\n\nOld Ursela laughed. \"Aye,\" said she, \"that he did and many times. Ah!\nme, those day's are all gone now.\" And she fetched a deep sigh. \"Then we\nlived in plenty and had both silks and linens and velvets besides in the\nstore closets and were able to buy good wines and live in plenty upon\nthe best. Now we dress in frieze and live upon what we can get and\nsometimes that is little enough, with nothing better than sour beer to\ndrink. But there is one comfort in it all, and that is that our good\nBaron paid back the score he owed the Trutz-Drachen people not only for\nthat, but for all that they had done from the very first.\"\n\nThereupon she went on to tell Otto how Baron Conrad had fulfilled the\npledge of revenge that he had made Abbot Otto, how he had watched day\nafter day until one time he had caught the Trutz-Drachen folk,\nwith Baron Frederick at their head, in a narrow defile back of the\nKaiserburg; of the fierce fight that was there fought; of how the\nRoderburgs at last fled, leaving Baron Frederick behind them wounded; of\nhow he had kneeled before the Baron Conrad, asking for mercy, and of\nhow Baron Conrad had answered, \"Aye, thou shalt have such mercy as thou\ndeservest,\" and had therewith raised his great two-handed sword and laid\nhis kneeling enemy dead at one blow.\n\nPoor little Otto had never dreamed that such cruelty and wickedness\ncould be. He listened to the old woman's story with gaping horror, and\nwhen the last came and she told him, with a smack of her lips, how his\nfather had killed his enemy with his own hand, he gave a gasping cry and\nsprang to his feet. Just then the door at the other end of the chamber\nwas noisily opened, and Baron Conrad himself strode into the room.\nOtto turned his head, and seeing who it was, gave another cry, loud and\nquavering, and ran to his father and caught him by the hand.\n\n\"Oh, father!\" he cried, \"oh, father! Is it true that thou hast killed a\nman with thy own hand?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said the Baron, grimly, \"it is true enough, and I think me I have\nkilled many more than one. But what of that, Otto? Thou must get out of\nthose foolish notions that the old monks have taught thee. Here in the\nworld it is different from what it is at St. Michaelsburg; here a man\nmust either slay or be slain.\"\n\nBut poor little Otto, with his face hidden in his father's robe, cried\nas though his heart would break. \"Oh, father!\" he said, again and again,\n\"it cannot be--it cannot be that thou who art so kind to me should have\nkilled a man with thine own hands.\" Then: \"I wish that I were back\nin the monastery again; I am afraid out here in the great wide world;\nperhaps somebody may kill me, for I am only a weak little boy and could\nnot save my own life if they chose to take it from me.\"\n\nBaron Conrad looked down upon Otto all this while, drawing his bushy\neyebrows together. Once he reached out his hand as though to stroke the\nboy's hair, but drew it back again.\n\nTurning angrily upon the old woman, \"Ursela,\" said he, \"thou must tell\nthe child no more such stories as these; he knowest not at all of such\nthings as yet. Keep thy tongue busy with the old woman's tales that he\nloves to hear thee tell, and leave it with me to teach him what becometh\na true knight and a Vuelph.\"\n\nThat night the father and son sat together beside the roaring fire in\nthe great ball. \"Tell me, Otto,\" said the Baron, \"dost thou hate me for\nhaving done what Ursela told thee today that I did?\"\n\nOtto looked for a while into his father's face. \"I know not,\" said he at\nlast, in his quaint, quiet voice, \"but methinks that I do not hate thee\nfor it.\"\n\nThe Baron drew his bushy brows together until his eyes twinkled out of\nthe depths beneath them, then of a sudden he broke into a great loud\nlaugh, smiting his horny palm with a smack upon his thigh.\n\n\n\n\nVII. The Red Cock Crows on Drachenhausen.\n\nThere was a new emperor in Germany who had come from a far away Swiss\ncastle; Count Rudolph of Hapsburg, a good, honest man with a good,\nhonest, homely face, but bringing with him a stern sense of justice and\nof right, and a determination to put down the lawlessness of the savage\nGerman barons among whom he had come as Emperor.\n\nOne day two strangers came galloping up the winding path to the gates\nof the Dragon's house. A horn sounded thin and clear, a parley was held\nacross the chasm in the road between the two strangers and the porter\nwho appeared at the little wicket. Then a messenger was sent running to\nthe Baron, who presently came striding across the open court-yard to the\ngateway to parley with the strangers.\n\nThe two bore with them a folded parchment with a great red seal\nhanging from it like a clot of blood; it was a message from the Emperor\ndemanding that the Baron should come to the Imperial Court to answer\ncertain charges that had been brought against him, and to give his bond\nto maintain the peace of the empire.\n\nOne by one those barons who had been carrying on their private wars, or\nhad been despoiling the burgher folk in their traffic from town to\ntown, and against whom complaint had been lodged, were summoned to the\nImperial Court, where they were compelled to promise peace and to swear\nallegiance to the new order of things. All those who came willingly were\nallowed to return home again after giving security for maintaining the\npeace; all those who came not willingly were either brought in chains\nor rooted out of their strongholds with fire and sword, and their roofs\nburned over their heads.\n\nNow it was Baron Conrad's turn to be summoned to the Imperial Court,\nfor complaint had been lodged against him by his old enemy of\nTrutz-Drachen--Baron Henry--the nephew of the old Baron Frederick\nwho had been slain while kneeling in the dust of the road back of the\nKaiserburg.\n\nNo one at Drachenhausen could read but Master Rudolph, the steward,\nwho was sand blind, and little Otto. So the boy read the summons to his\nfather, while the grim Baron sat silent with his chin resting upon his\nclenched fist and his eyebrows drawn together into a thoughtful frown as\nhe gazed into the pale face of his son, who sat by the rude oaken table\nwith the great parchment spread out before him.\n\nShould he answer the summons, or scorn it as he would have done under\nthe old emperors? Baron Conrad knew not which to do; pride said one\nthing and policy another. The Emperor was a man with an iron hand, and\nBaron Conrad knew what had happened to those who had refused to obey the\nimperial commands. So at last he decided that he would go to the court,\ntaking with him a suitable escort to support his dignity.\n\nIt was with nearly a hundred armed men clattering behind him that Baron\nConrad rode away to court to answer the imperial summons. The castle was\nstripped of its fighting men, and only eight remained behind to guard\nthe great stone fortress and the little simple-witted boy.\n\nIt was a sad mistake.\n\nThree days had passed since the Baron had left the castle, and now the\nthird night had come. The moon was hanging midway in the sky, white and\nfull, for it was barely past midnight.\n\nThe high precipitous banks of the rocky road threw a dense black shadow\ninto the gully below, and in that crooked inky line that scarred the\nwhite face of the moonlit rocks a band of some thirty men were creeping\nslowly and stealthily nearer and nearer to Castle Drachenhausen. At the\nhead of them was a tall, slender knight clad in light chain armor, his\nhead covered only by a steel cap or bascinet.\n\nAlong the shadow they crept, with only now and then a faint clink or\njingle of armor to break the stillness, for most of those who followed\nthe armed knight were clad in leathern jerkins; only one or two wearing\neven so much as a steel breast-plate by way of armor.\n\nSo at last they reached the chasm that yawned beneath the roadway, and\nthere they stopped, for they had reached the spot toward which they had\nbeen journeying. It was Baron Henry of Trutz-Drachen who had thus come\nin the silence of the night time to the Dragon's house, and his visit\nboded no good to those within.\n\nThe Baron and two or three of his men talked together in low tones, now\nand then looking up at the sheer wall that towered above them.\n\n\"Yonder is the place, Lord Baron,\" said one of those who stood with him.\n\"I have scanned every foot of the wall at night for a week past. An we\nget not in by that way, we get not in at all. A keen eye, a true aim,\nand a bold man are all that we need, and the business is done.\" Here\nagain all looked upward at the gray wall above them, rising up in the\nsilent night air.\n\nHigh aloft hung the wooden bartizan or watch-tower, clinging to the face\nof the outer wall and looming black against the pale sky above. Three\ngreat beams pierced the wall, and upon them the wooden tower rested. The\nmiddle beam jutted out beyond the rest to the distance of five or six\nfeet, and the end of it was carved into the rude semblance of a dragon's\nhead.\n\n\"So, good,\" said the Baron at last; \"then let us see if thy plan holds,\nand if Hans Schmidt's aim is true enough to earn the three marks that I\nhave promised him. Where is the bag?\"\n\nOne of those who stood near handed the Baron a leathern pouch, the Baron\nopened it and drew out a ball of fine thread, another of twine, a coil\nof stout rope, and a great bundle that looked, until it was unrolled,\nlike a coarse fish-net. It was a rope ladder. While these were being\nmade ready, Hans Schmidt, a thick-set, low-browed, broad-shouldered\narcher, strung his stout bow, and carefully choosing three arrows\nfrom those in his quiver, he stuck them point downward in the earth.\nUnwinding the ball of thread, he laid it loosely in large loops upon the\nground so that it might run easily without hitching, then he tied the\nend of the thread tightly around one of his arrows. He fitted the arrow\nto the bow and drew the feather to his ear. Twang! rang the bowstring,\nand the feathered messenger flew whistling upon its errand to the\nwatch-tower. The very first shaft did the work.\n\n\"Good,\" said Hans Schmidt, the archer, in his heavy voice, \"the three\nmarks are mine, Lord Baron.\"\n\nThe arrow had fallen over and across the jutting beam between the carved\ndragon's head and the bartizan, carrying with it the thread, which now\nhung from above, glimmering white in the moonlight like a cobweb.\n\nThe rest was an easy task enough. First the twine was drawn up to and\nover the beam by the thread, then the rope was drawn up by the twine,\nand last of all the rope ladder by the rope. There it hung like a thin,\nslender black line against the silent gray walls.\n\n\"And now,\" said the Baron, \"who will go first and win fifty marks for\nhis own, and climb the rope ladder to the tower yonder?\" Those around\nhesitated. \"Is there none brave enough to venture?\" said the Baron,\nafter a pause of silence.\n\nA stout, young fellow, of about eighteen years of age, stepped forward\nand flung his flat leathern cap upon the ground. \"I will go, my Lord\nBaron,\" said he.\n\n\"Good,\" said the Baron, \"the fifty marks are thine. And now listen, if\nthou findest no one in the watch-tower, whistle thus; if the watchman\nbe at his post, see that thou makest all safe before thou givest the\nsignal. When all is ready the others will follow thee. And now go and\ngood luck go with thee.\"\n\nThe young fellow spat upon his hands and, seizing the ropes, began\nslowly and carefully to mount the flimsy, shaking ladder. Those below\nheld it as tight as they were able, but nevertheless he swung backward\nand forward and round and round as he climbed steadily upward. Once he\nstopped upon the way, and those below saw him clutch the ladder close\nto him as though dizzied by the height and the motion but he soon began\nagain, up, up, up like some great black spider. Presently he came out\nfrom the black shadow below and into the white moonlight, and then his\nshadow followed him step by step up the gray wall upon his way. At last\nhe reached the jutting beam, and there again he stopped for a moment\nclutching tightly to it. The next he was upon the beam, dragging himself\ntoward the window of the bartizan just above. Slowly raising himself\nupon his narrow foothold he peeped cautiously within. Those watching\nhim from be low saw him slip his hand softly to his side, and then place\nsomething between his teeth. It was his dagger. Reaching up, he clutched\nthe window sill above him and, with a silent spring, seated himself\nupon it. The next moment he disappeared within. A few seconds of silence\nfollowed, then of sudden a sharp gurgling cry broke the stillness. There\nwas another pause of silence, then a faint shrill whistle sounded from\nabove.\n\n\"Who will go next?\" said the Baron. It was Hans Schmidt who stepped\nforward. Another followed the arch up the ladder, and another, and\nanother. Last of all went the Baron Henry himself, and nothing was left\nbut the rope ladder hanging from above, and swaying back and forth in\nthe wind.\n\nThat night Schwartz Carl had been bousing it over a pot of yellow wine\nin the pantry with his old crony, Master Rudolph, the steward; and the\ntwo, chatting and gossiping together, had passed the time away until\nlong after the rest of the castle had been wrapped in sleep. Then,\nperhaps a little unsteady upon his feet, Schwartz Carl betook himself\nhomeward to the Melchior tower.\n\nHe stood for a while in the shadow of the doorway, gazing up into the\npale sky above him at the great, bright, round moon, that hung like a\nbubble above the sharp peaks of the roofs standing black as ink against\nthe sky. But all of a sudden he started up from the post against which\nhe had been leaning, and with head bent to one side, stood listening\nbreathlessly, for he too had heard that smothered cry from the\nwatch-tower. So he stood intently, motionlessly, listening, listening;\nbut all was silent except for the monotonous dripping of water in one of\nthe nooks of the court-yard, and the distant murmur of the river borne\nupon the breath of the night air. \"Mayhap I was mistaken,\" muttered\nSchwartz Carl to himself.\n\nBut the next moment the silence was broken again by a faint, shrill\nwhistle; what did it mean?\n\nBack of the heavy oaken door of the tower was Schwartz Carl's cross-bow,\nthe portable windlass with which the bowstring was drawn back, and a\npouch of bolts. Schwartz Carl reached back into the darkness, fumbling\nin the gloom until his fingers met the weapon. Setting his foot in the\niron stirrup at the end of the stock, he wound the stout bow-string\ninto the notch of the trigger, and carefully fitted the heavy,\nmurderous-looking bolt into the groove.\n\nMinute after minute passed, and Schwartz Carl, holding his arbelast in\nhis hand, stood silently waiting and watching in the sharp-cut, black\nshadow of the doorway, motionless as a stone statue. Minute after minute\npassed. Suddenly there was a movement in the shadow of the arch of the\ngreat gateway across the court-yard, and the next moment a leathern-clad\nfigure crept noiselessly out upon the moonlit pavement, and stood there\nlistening, his head bent to one side. Schwartz Carl knew very well\nthat it was no one belonging to the castle, and, from the nature of his\naction, that he was upon no good errand.\n\nHe did not stop to challenge the suspicious stranger. The taking of\nanother's life was thought too small a matter for much thought or care\nin those days. Schwartz Carl would have shot a man for a much smaller\nreason than the suspicious actions of this fellow. The leather-clad\nfigure stood a fine target in the moonlight for a cross-bow bolt.\nSchwartz Carl slowly raised the weapon to his shoulder and took a long\nand steady aim. Just then the stranger put his fingers to his lips and\ngave a low, shrill whistle. It was the last whistle that he was to give\nupon this earth. There was a sharp, jarring twang of the bow-string, the\nhiss of the flying bolt, and the dull thud as it struck its mark. The\nman gave a shrill, quavering cry, and went staggering back, and then\nfell all of a heap against the wall behind him. As though in answer to\nthe cry, half a dozen men rushed tumultuously out from the shadow of\nthe gateway whence the stranger had just come, and then stood in the\ncourt-yard, looking uncertainly this way and that, not knowing from what\nquarter the stroke had come that had laid their comrade low.\n\nBut Schwartz Carl did not give them time to discover that; there was no\nchance to string his cumbersome weapon again; down he flung it upon the\nground. \"To arms!\" he roared in a voice of thunder, and then clapped to\nthe door of Melchior's tower and shot the great iron bolts with a clang\nand rattle.\n\nThe next instant the Trutz-Drachen men were thundering at the door, but\nSchwartz Carl was already far up the winding steps.\n\nBut now the others came pouring out from the gateway. \"To the house,\"\nroared Baron Henry.\n\nThen suddenly a clashing, clanging uproar crashed out upon the night.\nDong! Dong! It was the great alarm bell from Melchior's tower--Schwartz\nCarl was at his post.\n\nLittle Baron Otto lay sleeping upon the great rough bed in his room,\ndreaming of the White Cross on the hill and of brother John. By and by\nhe heard the convent bell ringing, and knew that there must be visitors\nat the gate, for loud voices sounded through his dream. Presently he\nknew that he was coming awake, but though the sunny monastery garden\ngrew dimmer and dimmer to his sleeping sight, the clanging of the bell\nand the sound of shouts grew louder and louder. Then he opened his eyes.\nFlaming red lights from torches, carried hither and thither by people\nin the court-yard outside, flashed and ran along the wall of his\nroom. Hoarse shouts and cries filled the air, and suddenly the shrill,\npiercing shriek of a woman rang from wall to wall; and through the\nnoises the great bell from far above upon Melchior's tower clashed and\nclanged its harsh, resonant alarm.\n\nOtto sprang from his bed and looked out of the window and down upon\nthe court-yard below. \"Dear God! what dreadful thing hath happened?\" he\ncried and clasped his hands together.\n\nA cloud of smoke was pouring out from the windows of the building across\nthe court-yard, whence a dull ruddy glow flashed and flickered. Strange\nmen were running here and there with flaming torches, and the now\ncontinuous shrieking of women pierced the air.\n\nJust beneath the window lay the figure of a man half naked and face\ndownward upon the stones. Then suddenly Otto cried out in fear and\nhorror, for, as he looked with dazed and bewildered eyes down into the\nlurid court-yard beneath, a savage man, in a shining breast-plate and\nsteel cap, came dragging the dark, silent figure of a woman across the\nstones; but whether she was dead or in a swoon, Otto could not tell.\n\nAnd every moment the pulsing of that dull red glare from the windows of\nthe building across the court-yard shone more brightly, and the glare\nfrom other flaming buildings, which Otto could not see from his window,\nturned the black, starry night into a lurid day.\n\nJust then the door of the room was burst open, and in rushed poor old\nUrsela, crazy with her terror. She flung herself down upon the floor and\ncaught Otto around the knees. \"Save me!\" she cried, \"save me!\" as though\nthe poor, pale child could be of any help to her at such a time. In the\npassageway without shone the light of torches, and the sound of loud\nfootsteps came nearer and nearer.\n\nAnd still through all the din sounded continually the clash and clang\nand clamor of the great alarm bell.\n\nThe red light flashed into the room, and in the doorway stood a tall,\nthin figure clad from head to foot in glittering chain armor. From\nbehind this fierce knight, with his dark, narrow, cruel face, its\ndeep-set eyes glistening in the light of the torches, crowded six or\neight savage, low-browed, brutal men, who stared into the room and\nat the white-faced boy as he stood by the window with the old woman\nclinging to his knees and praying to him for help.\n\n\"We have cracked the nut and here is the kernel,\" said one of them who\nstood behind the rest, and thereupon a roar of brutal laughter went up.\nBut the cruel face of the armed knight never relaxed into a smile;\nhe strode into the room and laid his iron hand heavily upon the boy's\nshoulder. \"Art thou the young Baron Otto?\" said he, in a harsh voice.\n\n\"Aye,\" said the lad; \"but do not kill me.\"\n\nThe knight did not answer him. \"Fetch the cord hither,\" said he, \"and\ndrag the old witch away.\"\n\nIt took two of them to loosen poor old Ursela's crazy clutch from about\nher young master. Then amid roars of laughter they dragged her away,\nscreaming and scratching and striking with her fists.\n\nThey drew back Otto's arms behind his back and wrapped them round and\nround with a bowstring. Then they pushed and hustled and thrust him\nforth from the room and along the passageway, now bright with the flames\nthat roared and crackled without. Down the steep stairway they drove\nhim, where thrice he stumbled and fell amid roars of laughter. At last\nthey were out into the open air of the court-yard. Here was a terrible\nsight, but Otto saw nothing of it; his blue eyes were gazing far away,\nand his lips moved softly with the prayer that the good monks of St.\nMichaelsburg had taught him, for he thought that they meant to slay him.\n\nAll around the court-yard the flames roared and snapped and crackled.\nFour or five figures lay scattered here and there, silent in all the\nglare and uproar. The heat was so intense that they were soon forced\nback into the shelter of the great gateway, where the women captives,\nunder the guard of three or four of the Trutz-Drachen men, were crowded\ntogether in dumb, bewildered terror. Only one man was to be seen among\nthe captives, poor, old, half blind Master Rudolph, the steward,\nwho crouched tremblingly among the women. They had set the blaze to\nMelchior's tower, and now, below, it was a seething furnace. Above, the\nsmoke rolled in black clouds from the windows, but still the alarm bell\nsounded through all the blaze and smoke. Higher and higher the flames\nrose; a trickle of fire ran along the frame buildings hanging aloft in\nthe air. A clear flame burst out at the peak of the roof, but still the\nbell rang forth its clamorous clangor. Presently those who watched below\nsaw the cluster of buildings bend and sink and sway; there was a crash\nand roar, a cloud of sparks flew up as though to the very heavens\nthemselves, and the bell of Melchior's tower was stilled forever. A\ngreat shout arose from the watching, upturned faces.\n\n\"Forward!\" cried Baron Henry, and out from the gateway they swept and\nacross the drawbridge, leaving Drachenhausen behind them a flaming\nfurnace blazing against the gray of the early dawning.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. In the House of the Dragon Scorner.\n\nTall, narrow, gloomy room; no furniture but a rude bench a bare stone\nfloor, cold stone walls and a gloomy ceiling of arched stone over head;\na long, narrow slit of a window high above in the wall, through the iron\nbars of which Otto could see a small patch of blue sky and now and then\na darting swallow, for an instant seen, the next instant gone. Such\nwas the little baron's prison in Trutz-Drachen. Fastened to a bolt\nand hanging against the walls, hung a pair of heavy chains with gaping\nfetters at the ends. They were thick with rust, and the red stain of\nthe rust streaked the wall below where they hung like a smear of blood.\nLittle Otto shuddered as he looked at them; can those be meant for me,\nhe thought.\n\nNothing was to be seen but that one patch of blue sky far up in the\nwall. No sound from without was to be heard in that gloomy cell of\nstone, for the window pierced the outer wall, and the earth and its\nnoises lay far below.\n\nSuddenly a door crashed without, and the footsteps of men were heard\ncoming along the corridor. They stopped in front of Otto's cell; he\nheard the jingle of keys, and then a loud rattle of one thrust into\nthe lock of the heavy oaken door. The rusty bolt was shot back with a\nscreech, the door opened, and there stood Baron Henry, no longer in his\narmor, but clad in a long black robe that reached nearly to his feet,\na broad leather belt was girdled about his waist, and from it dangled a\nshort, heavy hunting sword.\n\nAnother man was with the Baron, a heavy-faced fellow clad in a leathern\njerkin over which was drawn a short coat of linked mail.\n\nThe two stood for a moment looking into the room, and Otto, his pale\nface glimmering in the gloom, sat upon the edge of the heavy wooden\nbench or bed, looking back at them out of his great blue eyes. Then the\ntwo entered and closed the door behind them.\n\n\"Dost thou know why thou art here?\" said the Baron, in his deep, harsh\nvoice.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto, \"I know not.\"\n\n\"So?\" said the Baron. \"Then I will tell thee. Three years ago the good\nBaron Frederick, my uncle, kneeled in the dust and besought mercy at thy\nfather's hands; the mercy he received was the coward blow that slew him.\nThou knowest the story?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto, tremblingly, \"I know it.\"\n\n\"Then dost thou not know why I am here?\" said the Baron.\n\n\"Nay, dear Lord Baron, I know not,\" said poor little Otto, and began to\nweep.\n\nThe Baron stood for a moment or two looking gloomily upon him, as the\nlittle boy sat there with the tears running down his white face.\n\n\"I will tell thee,\" said he, at last; \"I swore an oath that the red cock\nshould crow on Drachenhausen, and I have given it to the dames. I swore\nan oath that no Vuelph that ever left my hands should be able to strike\nsuch a blow as thy father gave to Baron Frederick, and now I will fulfil\nthat too. Catch the boy, Casper, and hold him.\"\n\nAs the man in the mail shirt stepped toward little Otto, the boy leaped\nup from where he sat and caught the Baron about the knees. \"Oh! dear\nLord Baron,\" he cried, \"do not harm me; I am only a little child, I have\nnever done harm to thee; do not harm me.\"\n\n\"Take him away,\" said the Baron, harshly.\n\nThe fellow stooped, and loosening Otto's hold, in spite of his struggles\nand cries, carried him to the bench, against which he held him, whilst\nthe Baron stood above him.\n\nBaron Henry and the other came forth from the cell, carefully closing\nthe wooden door behind them. At the end of the corridor the Baron\nturned, \"Let the leech be sent to the boy,\" said he. And then he turned\nand walked away.\n\nOtto lay upon the hard couch in his cell, covered with a shaggy bear\nskin. His face was paler and thinner than ever, and dark rings encircled\nhis blue eyes. He was looking toward the door, for there was a noise of\nsomeone fumbling with the lock without.\n\nSince that dreadful day when Baron Henry had come to his cell, only two\nsouls had visited Otto. One was the fellow who had come with the Baron\nthat time; his name, Otto found, was Casper. He brought the boy his rude\nmeals of bread and meat and water. The other visitor was the leech or\ndoctor, a thin, weasand little man, with a kindly, wrinkled face and a\ngossiping tongue, who, besides binding wounds, bleeding, and leeching,\nand administering his simple remedies to those who were taken sick in\nthe castle, acted as the Baron's barber.\n\nThe Baron had left the key in the lock of the door, so that these two\nmight enter when they chose, but Otto knew that it was neither the one\nnor the other whom he now heard at the door, working uncertainly with\nthe key, striving to turn it in the rusty, cumbersome lock. At last the\nbolts grated back, there was a pause, and then the door opened a little\nway, and Otto thought that he could see someone peeping in from without.\nBy and by the door opened further, there was another pause, and then\na slender, elfish-looking little girl, with straight black hair and\nshining black eyes, crept noiselessly into the room.\n\nShe stood close by the door with her finger in her mouth, staring at\nthe boy where he lay upon his couch, and Otto upon his part lay, full of\nwonder, gazing back upon the little elfin creature.\n\nShe, seeing that he made no sign or motion, stepped a little nearer, and\nthen, after a moment's pause, a little nearer still, until, at last, she\nstood within a few feet of where he lay.\n\n\"Art thou the Baron Otto?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Otto.\n\n\"Prut!\" said she, \"and is that so! Why, I thought that thou wert a great\ntall fellow at least, and here thou art a little boy no older than Carl\nMax, the gooseherd.\" Then, after a little pause--\"My name is Pauline,\nand my father is the Baron. I heard him tell my mother all about thee,\nand so I wanted to come here and see thee myself: Art thou sick?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Otto, \"I am sick.\"\n\n\"And did my father hurt thee?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto, and his eyes filled with tears, until one sparkling\ndrop trickled slowly down his white face.\n\nLittle Pauline stood looking seriously at him for a while. \"I am sorry\nfor thee, Otto,\" said she, at last. And then, at her childish pity, he\nbegan crying in earnest.\n\nThis was only the first visit of many from the little maid, for after\nthat she often came to Otto's prison, who began to look for her coming\nfrom day to day as the one bright spot in the darkness and the gloom.\n\nSitting upon the edge of his bed and gazing into his face with wide open\neyes, she would listen to him by the hour, as he told her of his life in\nthat far away monastery home; of poor, simple brother John's wonderful\nvisions, of the good Abbot's books with their beautiful pictures, and of\nall the monkish tales and stories of knights and dragons and heroes and\nemperors of ancient Rome, which brother Emmanuel had taught him to read\nin the crabbed monkish Latin in which they were written.\n\nOne day the little maid sat for a long while silent after he had ended\nspeaking. At last she drew a deep breath. \"And are all these things that\nthou tellest me about the priests in their castle really true?\" said\nshe.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Otto, \"all are true.\"\n\n\"And do they never go out to fight other priests?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Otto, \"they know nothing of fighting.\"\n\n\"So!\" said she. And then fell silent in the thought of the wonder of\nit all, and that there should be men in the world that knew nothing of\nviolence and bloodshed; for in all the eight years of her life she had\nscarcely been outside of the walls of Castle Trutz-Drachen.\n\nAt another time it was of Otto's mother that they were speaking.\n\n\"And didst thou never see her, Otto?\" said the little girl.\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto, \"I see her sometimes in my dreams, and her face always\nshines so bright that I know she is an angel; for brother John has often\nseen the dear angels, and he tells me that their faces always shine in\nthat way. I saw her the night thy father hurt me so, for I could not\nsleep and my head felt as though it would break asunder. Then she\ncame and leaned over me and kissed my forehead, and after that I fell\nasleep.\"\n\n\"But where did she come from, Otto?\" said the little girl.\n\n\"From paradise, I think,\" said Otto, with that patient seriousness that\nhe had caught from the monks, and that sat so quaintly upon him.\n\n\"So!\" said little Pauline; and then, after a pause, \"That is why thy\nmother kissed thee when thy head ached--because she is an angel. When\nI was sick my mother bade Gretchen carry me to a far part of the house,\nbecause I cried and so troubled her. Did thy mother ever strike thee,\nOtto?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto.\n\n\"Mine hath often struck me,\" said Pauline.\n\nOne day little Pauline came bustling into Otto's cell, her head full of\nthe news which she carried. \"My father says that thy father is out\nin the woods somewhere yonder, back of the castle, for Fritz, the\nswineherd, told my father that last night he had seen a fire in the\nwoods, and that he had crept up to it without anyone knowing. There he\nhad seen the Baron Conrad and six of his men, and that they were eating\none of the swine that they had killed and roasted. Maybe,\" said she,\nseating herself upon the edge of Otto's couch; \"maybe my father will\nkill thy father, and they will bring him here and let him lie upon a\nblack bed with bright candles burning around him, as they did my uncle\nFrederick when he was killed.\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" said Otto, and then lay for a while with his hands\nclasped. \"Dost thou love me, Pauline?\" said he, after a while.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pauline, \"for thou art a good child, though my father says\nthat thy wits are cracked.\"\n\n\"Mayhap they are,\" said Otto, simply, \"for I have often been told so\nbefore. But thou wouldst not see me die, Pauline; wouldst thou?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Pauline, \"I would not see thee die, for then thou couldst\ntell me no more stories; for they told me that uncle Frederick could not\nspeak because he was dead.\"\n\n\"Then listen, Pauline,\" said Otto; \"if I go not away from here I shall\nsurely die. Every day I grow more sick and the leech cannot cure me.\"\nHere he broke down and, turning his face upon the couch, began crying,\nwhile little Pauline sat looking seriously at him.\n\n\"Why dost thou cry, Otto?\" said she, after a while.\n\n\"Because,\" said he, \"I am so sick, and I want my father to come and take\nme away from here.\"\n\n\"But why dost thou want to go away?\" said Pauline. \"If thy father takes\nthee away, thou canst not tell me any more stories.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can,\" said Otto, \"for when I grow to be a man I will come\nagain and marry thee, and when thou art my wife I can tell thee all the\nstories that I know. Dear Pauline, canst thou not tell my father where I\nam, that he may come here and take me away before I die?\"\n\n\"Mayhap I could do so,\" said Pauline, after a little while, \"for\nsometimes I go with Casper Max to see his mother, who nursed me when I\nwas a baby. She is the wife of Fritz, the swineherd, and she will make\nhim tell thy father; for she will do whatever I ask of her, and Fritz\nwill do whatever she bids him do.\"\n\n\"And for my sake, wilt thou tell him, Pauline?\" said Otto.\n\n\"But see, Otto,\" said the little girl, \"if I tell him, wilt thou promise\nto come indeed and marry me when thou art grown a man?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Otto, very seriously, \"I will promise.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell thy father where thou art,\" said she.\n\n\"But thou wilt do it without the Baron Henry knowing, wilt thou not,\nPauline?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, \"for if my father and my mother knew that I did such\na thing, they would strike me, mayhap send me to my bed alone in the\ndark.\"\n\n\n\n\nIX. How One-eyed Hans came to Trutz-Drachen.\n\nFritz, the swineherd, sat eating his late supper of porridge out of a\ngreat, coarse, wooden bowl; wife Katherine sat at the other end of the\ntable, and the half-naked little children played upon the earthen floor.\nA shaggy dog lay curled up in front of the fire, and a grunting pig\nscratched against a leg of the rude table close beside where the woman\nsat.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Katherine, speaking of the matter of which they had\nalready been talking. \"It is all very true that the Drachenhausens are a\nbad lot, and I for one am of no mind to say no to that; all the same it\nis a sad thing that a simple-witted little child like the young Baron\nshould be so treated as the boy has been; and now that our Lord Baron\nhas served him so that he, at least, will never be able to do us 'harm,\nI for one say that he should not be left there to die alone in that\nblack cell.\"\n\nFritz, the swineherd, gave a grunt at this without raising his eyes from\nthe bowl.\n\n\"Yes, good,\" said Katherine, \"I know what thou meanest, Fritz, and that\nit is none of my business to be thrusting my finger into the Baron's\ndish. But to hear the way that dear little child spoke when she was here\nthis morn--it would have moved a heart of stone to hear her tell of all\nhis pretty talk. Thou wilt try to let the red-beard know that that poor\nboy, his son, is sick to death in the black cell; wilt thou not, Fritz?\"\n\nThe swineherd dropped his wooden spoon into the bowl with a clatter.\n\"Potstausand!\" he cried; \"art thou gone out of thy head to let thy wits\nrun upon such things as this of which thou talkest to me? If it should\ncome to our Lord Baron's ears he would cut the tongue from out thy head\nand my head from off my shoulders for it. Dost thou think I am going to\nmeddle in such a matter as this? Listen! these proud Baron folk, with\ntheir masterful ways, drive our sort hither and thither; they beat us,\nthey drive us, they kill us as they choose. Our lives are not as much\nto them as one of my black swine. Why should I trouble my head if they\nchoose to lop and trim one another? The fewer there are of them the\nbetter for us, say I. We poor folk have a hard enough life of it without\nthrusting our heads into the noose to help them out of their troubles.\nWhat thinkest thou would happen to us if Baron Henry should hear of our\nbetraying his affairs to the Red-beard?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Katherine, \"thou hast naught to do in the matter but to tell\nthe Red-beard in what part of the castle the little Baron lies.\"\n\n\"And what good would that do?\" said Fritz, the swineherd.\n\n\"I know not,\" said Katherine, \"but I have promised the little one that\nthou wouldst find the Baron Conrad and tell him that much.\"\n\n\"Thou hast promised a mare's egg,\" said her husband, angrily. \"How shall\nI find the Baron Conrad to bear a message to him, when our Baron has\nbeen looking for him in vain for two days past?\"\n\n\"Thou has found him once and thou mayst find him again,\" said Katherine,\n\"for it is not likely that he will keep far away from here whilst his\nboy is in such sore need of help.\"\n\n\"I will have nothing to do with it!\" said Fritz, and he got up from the\nwooden block whereon he was sitting and stumped out of the house. But,\nthen, Katherine had heard him talk in that way before, and knew, in\nspite of his saying \"no,\" that, sooner or later, he would do as she\nwished.\n\nTwo days later a very stout little one-eyed man, clad in a leathern\njerkin and wearing a round leathern cap upon his head, came toiling up\nthe path to the postern door of Trutz-Drachen, his back bowed under the\nburthen of a great peddler's pack. It was our old friend the one-eyed\nHans, though even his brother would hardly have known him in his present\nguise, for, besides having turned peddler, he had grown of a sudden\nsurprisingly fat.\n\nRap-tap-tap! He knocked at the door with a knotted end of the crooked\nthorned staff upon which he leaned. He waited for a while and then\nknocked again--rap-tap-tap!\n\nPresently, with a click, a little square wicket that pierced the door\nwas opened, and a woman's face peered out through the iron bars.\n\nThe one-eyed Hans whipped off his leathern cap.\n\n\"Good day, pretty one,\" said he, \"and hast thou any need of glass beads,\nribbons, combs, or trinkets? Here I am come all the way from Gruenstadt,\nwith a pack full of such gay things as thou never laid eyes on before.\nHere be rings and bracelets and necklaces that might be of pure silver\nand set with diamonds and rubies, for anything that thy dear one could\ntell if he saw thee decked in them. And all are so cheap that thou hast\nonly to say, 'I want them,' and they are thine.\"\n\nThe frightened face at the window looked from right to left and from\nleft to right. \"Hush,\" said the girl, and laid her finger upon her lips.\n\"There! thou hadst best get away from here, poor soul, as fast as thy\nlegs can carry thee, for if the Lord Baron should find thee here talking\nsecretly at the postern door, he would loose the wolf-hounds upon thee.\"\n\n\"Prut,\" said one-eyed Hans, with a grin, \"the Baron is too big a fly to\nsee such a little gnat as I; but wolf-hounds or no wolf-hounds, I\ncan never go hence without showing thee the pretty things that I have\nbrought from the town, even though my stay be at the danger of my own\nhide.\"\n\nHe flung the pack from off his shoulders as he spoke and fell to\nunstrapping it, while the round face of the lass (her eyes big with\ncuriosity) peered down at him through the grated iron bars.\n\nHans held up a necklace of blue and white beads that glistened like\njewels in the sun, and from them hung a gorgeous filigree cross. \"Didst\nthou ever see a sweeter thing than this?\" said he; \"and look, here is a\ncomb that even the silversmith would swear was pure silver all the way\nthrough.\" Then, in a soft, wheedling voice, \"Canst thou not let me in,\nmy little bird? Sure there are other lasses besides thyself who would\nlike to trade with a poor peddler who has travelled all the way from\nGruenstadt just to please the pretty ones of Trutz-Drachen.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the lass, in a frightened voice, \"I cannot let thee in; I\nknow not what the Baron would do to me, even now, if he knew that I was\nhere talking to a stranger at the postern;\" and she made as if she would\nclap to the little window in his face; but the one-eyed Hans thrust his\nstaff betwixt the bars and so kept the shutter open.\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said he, eagerly, \"do not go away from me too soon. Look,\ndear one; seest thou this necklace?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said she, looking hungrily at it.\n\n\"Then listen; if thou wilt but let me into the castle, so that I may\nstrike a trade, I will give it to thee for thine own without thy paying\na barley corn for it.\"\n\nThe girl looked and hesitated, and then looked again; the temptation was\ntoo great. There was a noise of softly drawn bolts and bars, the door\nwas hesitatingly opened a little way, and, in a twinkling, the one-eyed\nHans had slipped inside the castle, pack and all.\n\n\"The necklace,\" said the girl, in a frightened whisper.\n\nHans thrust it into her hand. \"It's thine,\" said he, \"and now wilt thou\nnot help me to a trade?\"\n\n\"I will tell my sister that thou art here,\" said she, and away she ran\nfrom the little stone hallway, carefully bolting and locking the further\ndoor behind her.\n\nThe door that the girl had locked was the only one that connected the\npostern hail with the castle.\n\nThe one-eyed Hans stood looking after her. \"Thou fool!\" he muttered to\nhimself, \"to lock the door behind thee. What shall I do next, I should\nlike to know? Here am I just as badly off as I was when I stood outside\nthe walls. Thou hussy! If thou hadst but let me into the castle for only\ntwo little minutes, I would have found somewhere to have hidden myself\nwhile thy back was turned. But what shall I do now?\" He rested his pack\nupon the floor and stood looking about him.\n\nBuilt in the stone wall opposite to him, was a high, narrow fireplace\nwithout carving of any sort. As Hans' one eye wandered around the bare\nstone space, his glance fell at last upon it, and there it rested. For\na while he stood looking intently at it, presently he began rubbing his\nhand over his bristling chin in a thoughtful, meditative manner. Finally\nhe drew a deep breath, and giving himself a shake as though to arouse\nhimself from his thoughts, and after listening a moment or two to\nmake sure that no one was nigh, he walked softly to the fireplace, and\nstooping, peered up the chimney. Above him yawned a black cavernous\ndepth, inky with the soot of years. Hans straightened himself, and\ntilting his leathern cap to one side, began scratching his bullet-head;\nat last he drew a long breath. \"Yes, good,\" he muttered to himself; \"he\nwho jumps into the river must e'en swim the best he can. It is a vile,\ndirty place to thrust one's self; but I am in for it now, and must make\nthe best of a lame horse.\"\n\nHe settled the cap more firmly upon his head, spat upon his hands, and\nonce more stooping in the fireplace, gave a leap, and up the chimney he\nwent with a rattle of loose mortar and a black trickle of soot.\n\nBy and by footsteps sounded outside the door. There was a pause; a\nhurried whispering of women's voices; the twitter of a nervous laugh,\nand then the door was pushed softly opens and the girl to whom the\none-eyed Hans had given the necklace of blue and white beads with the\nfiligree cross hanging from it, peeped uncertainly into the room. Behind\nher broad, heavy face were three others, equally homely and stolid; for\na while all four stood there, looking blankly into the room and around\nit. Nothing was there but the peddler's knapsack lying in the middle of\nthe floor-the man was gone. The light of expectancy slowly faded Out of\nthe girl's face, and in its place succeeded first bewilderment and then\ndull alarm. \"But, dear heaven,\" she said, \"where then has the peddler\nman gone?\"\n\nA moment or two of silence followed her speech. \"Perhaps,\" said one of\nthe others, in a voice hushed with awe, \"perhaps it was the evil one\nhimself to whom thou didst open the door.\"\n\nAgain there was a hushed and breathless pause; it was the lass who had\nlet Hans in at the postern, who next spoke.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, in a voice trembling with fright at what she had done,\n\"yes, it must have been the evil one, for now I remember he had but one\neye.\" The four girls crossed themselves, and their eyes grew big and\nround with the fright.\n\nSuddenly a shower of mortar came rattling down the chimney. \"Ach!\" cried\nthe four, as with one voice. Bang! the door was clapped to and away they\nscurried like a flock of frightened rabbits.\n\nWhen Jacob, the watchman, came that way an hour later, upon his evening\nround of the castle, he found a peddler's knapsack lying in the middle\nof the floor. He turned it over with his pike-staff and saw that it was\nfull of beads and trinkets and ribbons.\n\n\"How came this here?\" said he. And then, without waiting for the answer\nwhich he did not expect, he flung it over his shoulder and marched away\nwith it.\n\n\n\n\nX. How Hans Brought Terror to the Kitchen.\n\nHans found himself in a pretty pickle in the chimney, for the soot got\ninto his one eye and set it to watering, and into his nose and set him\nto sneezing, and into his mouth and his ears and his hair. But still\nhe struggled on, up and up; \"for every chimney has a top,\" said Hans\nto himself \"and I am sure to climb out somewhere or other.\" Suddenly he\ncame to a place where another chimney joined the one he was climbing,\nand here he stopped to consider the matter at his leisure. \"See now,\" he\nmuttered, \"if I still go upward I may come out at the top of some tall\nchimney-stack with no way of getting down outside. Now, below here\nthere must be a fire-place somewhere, for a chimney does not start from\nnothing at all; yes, good! we will go down a while and see what we make\nof that.\"\n\nIt was a crooked, zigzag road that he had to travel, and rough and hard\ninto the bargain. His one eye tingled and smarted, and his knees and\nelbows were rubbed to the quick; nevertheless One-eyed Hans had been in\nworse trouble than this in his life.\n\nDown he went and down he went, further than he had climbed upward\nbefore. \"Sure, I must be near some place or other,\" he thought.\n\nAs though in instant answer to his thoughts, he heard the sudden sound\nof a voice so close beneath him that he stopped short in his downward\nclimbing and stood as still as a mouse, with his heart in his mouth.\nA few inches more and he would have been discovered;--what would have\nhappened then would have been no hard matter to foretell.\n\nHans braced his back against one side of the chimney, his feet against\nthe other and then, leaning forward, looked down between his knees. The\ngray light of the coming evening glimmered in a wide stone fireplace\njust below him. Within the fireplace two people were moving about upon\nthe broad hearth, a great, fat woman and a shock-headed boy. The woman\nheld a spit with two newly trussed fowls upon it, so that One-eyed Hans\nknew that she must be the cook.\n\n\"Thou ugly toad,\" said the woman to the boy, \"did I not bid thee make a\nfire an hour ago? and now, here there is not so much as a spark to roast\nthe fowls withall, and they to be basted for the lord Baron's supper.\nWhere hast thou been for all this time?\"\n\n\"No matter,\" said the boy, sullenly, as he laid the fagots ready for the\nlighting; \"no matter, I was not running after Long Jacob, the bowman, to\ntry to catch him for a sweetheart, as thou hast been doing.\"\n\nThe reply was instant and ready. The cook raised her hand; \"smack!\" she\nstruck and a roar from the scullion followed.\n\n\"Yes, good,\" thought Hans, as he looked down upon them; \"I am glad that\nthe boy's ear was not on my head.\"\n\n\"Now give me no more of thy talk,\" said the woman, \"but do the work\nthat thou hast been bidden.\" Then--\"How came all this black soot here, I\nshould like to know?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" snuffled the scullion, \"mayhap thou wouldst blame\nthat on me also?\"\n\n\"That is my doing,\" whispered Hans to himself; \"but if they light the\nfire, what then becomes of me?\"\n\n\"See now,\" said the cook; \"I go to make the cakes ready; if I come back\nand find that thou hast not built the fire, I will warm thy other ear\nfor thee.\"\n\n\"So,\" thought Hans; \"then will be my time to come down the chimney, for\nthere will be but one of them.\"\n\nThe next moment he heard the door close and knew that the cook had gone\nto make the cakes ready as she said. And as he looked down he saw that\nthe boy was bending over the bundle of fagots, blowing the spark that\nhe had brought in upon the punk into a flame. The dry fagots began to\ncrackle and blaze. \"Now is my time,\" said Hans to himself. Bracing his\nelbows against each side of the chimney, he straightened his legs so\nthat he might fall clear His motions loosened little shower of soot that\nfell rattling upon the fagots that were now beginning to blaze brightly,\nwhereupon the boy raised his face and looked up. Hans loosened his hold\nupon the chimney; crash! he fell, lighting upon his feet in the midst\nof the burning fagots. The scullion boy tumbled backward upon the floor,\nwhere he lay upon the broad of his back with a face as white as\ndough and eyes and mouth agape, staring speechlessly at the frightful\ninky-black figure standing in the midst of the flames and smoke. Then\nhis scattered wits came back to him. \"It is the evil one,\" he roared.\nAnd thereupon, turning upon his side, he half rolled, half scrambled to\nthe door. Then out he leaped and, banging it to behind him, flew down\nthe passageway, yelling with fright and never daring once to look behind\nhim.\n\nAll the time One-eyed Hans was brushing away the sparks that clung to\nhis clothes. He was as black as ink from head to foot with the soot from\nthe chimney.\n\n\"So far all is good,\" he muttered to himself, \"but if I go wandering\nabout in my sooty shoes I will leave black tracks to follow me, so there\nis nothing to do but e'en to go barefoot.\"\n\nHe stooped and drawing the pointed soft leather shoes from his feet, he\nthrew them upon the now blazing fagots, where they writhed and twisted\nand wrinkled, and at last burst into a flame. Meanwhile Hans lost no\ntime; he must find a hiding-place, and quickly, if he would yet hope\nto escape. A great bread trough stood in the corner of the kitchen--a\nhopper-shaped chest with a flat lid. It was the best hiding place that\nthe room afforded. Without further thought Hans ran to it, snatching up\nfrom the table as he passed a loaf of black bread and a bottle half full\nof stale wine, for he had had nothing to eat since that morning. Into\nthe great bread trough he climbed, and drawing the lid down upon him,\ncurled himself up as snugly as a mouse in its nest.\n\nFor a while the kitchen lay in silence, but at last the sound of voices\nwas heard at the door, whispering together in low tones. Suddenly the\ndoor was flung open and a tall, lean, lantern-jawed fellow, clad in\nrough frieze, strode into the room and stood there glaring with half\nfrightened boldness around about him; three or four women and the\ntrembling scullion crowded together in a frightened group behind him.\n\nThe man was Long Jacob, the bowman; but, after all, his boldness was\nall wasted, for not a thread or a hair was to be seen, but only the\ncrackling fire throwing its cheerful ruddy glow upon the wall of the\nroom, now rapidly darkening in the falling gray of the twilight without.\n\nThe fat cook's fright began rapidly to turn into anger.\n\n\"Thou imp,\" she cried, \"it is one of thy tricks,\" and she made a dive\nfor the scullion, who ducked around the skirts of one of the other women\nand so escaped for the time; but Long Jacob wrinkled up his nose and\nsniffed. \"Nay,\" said he, \"me thinks that there lieth some truth in the\ntale that the boy hath told, for here is a vile smell of burned horn\nthat the black one bath left behind him.\"\n\nIt was the smell from the soft leather shoes that Hans had burned.\n\nThe silence of night had fallen over the Castle of Trutz-Drachen; not\na sound was heard but the squeaking of mice scurring behind the\nwainscoting, the dull dripping of moisture from the eaves, or the\nsighing of the night wind around the gables and through the naked\nwindows of the castle.\n\nThe lid of the great dough trough was softly raised, and a face, black\nwith soot, peeped cautiously out from under it. Then little by little\narose a figure as black as the face; and One-eyed Hans stepped out upon\nthe floor, stretching and rubbing himself.\n\n\"Methinks I must have slept,\" he muttered. \"Hui, I am as stiff as a new\nleather doublet, and now, what next is to become of me? I hope my luck\nmay yet stick to me, in spite of this foul black soot!\"\n\nAlong the middle of the front of the great hall of the castle, ran a\nlong stone gallery, opening at one end upon the court-yard by a high\nflight of stone steps. A man-at-arms in breast-plate and steel cap, and\nbearing a long pike, paced up and down the length of this gallery, now\nand then stopping, leaning over the edge, and gazing up into the starry\nsky above; then, with a long drawn yawn, lazily turning back to the\nmonotonous watch again.\n\nA dark figure crept out from an arched doorway at the lower part of the\nlong straight building, and some little distance below the end gallery,\nbut the sentry saw nothing of it, for his back was turned. As silently\nand as stealthily as a cat the figure crawled along by the dark shadowy\nwall, now and then stopping, and then again creeping slowly forward\ntoward the gallery where the man-at-arms moved monotonously up and down.\nIt was One-eyed Hans in his bare feet.\n\nInch by inch, foot by foot--the black figure crawled along in the angle\nof the wall; inch by inch and foot by foot, but ever nearer and nearer\nto the long straight row of stone steps that led to the covered gallery.\nAt last it crouched at the lowest step of the flight. Just then the\nsentinel upon watch came to the very end of the gallery and stood there\nleaning upon his spear. Had he looked down below he could not have\nfailed to have seen One-eyed Hans lying there motionlessly; but he was\ngazing far away over the steep black roofs beyond, and never saw the\nunsuspected presence. Minute after minute passed, and the one stood\nthere looking out into the night and the other lay crouching by the\nwall; then with a weary sigh the sentry turned and began slowly pacing\nback again toward the farther end of the gallery.\n\nInstantly the motionless figure below arose and glided noiselessly and\nswiftly up the flight of steps.\n\nTwo rude stone pillars flanked either side of the end of the gallery.\nLike a shadow the black figure slipped behind one of these, flattening\nitself up against the wall, where it stood straight and motionless as\nthe shadows around it.\n\nDown the long gallery came the watchman, his sword clinking loudly in\nthe silence as he walked, tramp, tramp, tramp! clink, clank, jingle.\n\nWithin three feet of the motionless figure behind the pillar he turned,\nand began retracing his monotonous steps. Instantly the other left the\nshadow of the post and crept rapidly and stealthily after him. One step,\ntwo steps the sentinel took; for a moment the black figure behind him\nseemed to crouch and draw together, then like a flash it leaped forward\nupon its victim.\n\nA shadowy cloth fell upon the man's face, and in an instant he was flung\nback and down with a muffled crash upon the stones. Then followed a\nfierce and silent struggle in the darkness, but strong and sturdy as the\nman was, he was no match for the almost superhuman strength of One-eyed\nHans. The cloth which he had flung over his head was tied tightly and\nsecurely. Then the man was forced upon his face and, in spite of his\nfierce struggles, his arms were bound around and around with strong fine\ncord; next his feet were bound in the same way, and the task was done.\nThen Hans stood upon his feet, and wiped the sweat from his swarthy\nforehead. \"Listen, brother,\" he whispered, and as he spoke he stooped\nand pressed something cold and hard against the neck of the other.\n\"Dost thou know the feel of this? It is a broad dagger, and if thou\ndost contrive to loose that gag from thy mouth and makest any outcry, it\nshall be sheathed in thy weasand.\"\n\nSo saying, he thrust the knife back again into its sheath, then stooping\nand picking up the other, he flung him across his shoulder like a sack,\nand running down the steps as lightly as though his load was nothing at\nall, he carried his burden to the arched doorway whence he had come a\nlittle while before. There, having first stripped his prisoner of\nall his weapons, Hans sat the man up in the angle of the wall. \"So,\nbrother;\" said he, \"now we can talk with more ease than we could up\nyonder. I will tell thee frankly why I am here; it is to find where the\nyoung Baron Otto of Drachenhausen is kept. If thou canst tell me,\nwell and good; if not, I must e'en cut thy weasand and find me one who\nknoweth more. Now, canst thou tell me what I would learn, brother?\"\n\nThe other nodded dimly in the darkness.\n\n\"That is good,\" said Hans, \"then I will loose thy gag until thou hast\ntold me; only bear in mind what I said concerning my dagger.\"\n\nThereupon, he unbound his prisoner, and the fellow slowly rose to his\nfeet. He shook himself and looked all about him in a heavy, bewildered\nfashion, as though he had just awakened from a dream.\n\nHis right hand slid furtively down to his side, but the dagger-sheath\nwas empty.\n\n\"Come, brother!\" said Hans, impatiently, \"time is passing, and once lost\ncan never be found again. Show me the way to the young Baron Otto or--.\"\nAnd he whetted the shining blade of his dagger on his horny palm.\n\nThe fellow needed no further bidding; turning, he led the way, and\ntogether they were swallowed up in the yawning shadows, and again the\nhush of night-time lay upon the Castle of Trutz-Drachen.\n\n\n\n\nXI. How Otto was Saved.\n\nLittle Otto was lying upon the hard couch in his cell, tossing in\nrestless and feverish sleep; suddenly a heavy hand was laid upon him and\na voice whispered in his ear, \"Baron, Baron Otto, waken, rouse yourself;\nI am come to help you. I am One-eyed Hans.\"\n\nOtto was awake in an instant and raised himself upon his elbow in the\ndarkness. \"One-eyed Hans,\" he breathed, \"One-eyed Hans; who is One-eyed\nHans?\"\n\n\"True,\" said the other, \"thou dost not know me. I am thy father's\ntrusted servant, and am the only one excepting his own blood and kin\nwho has clung to him in this hour of trouble. Yes, all are gone but me\nalone, and so I have come to help thee away from this vile place.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, good Hans! if only thou canst!\" cried Otto; \"if only thou\ncanst take me away from this wicked place. Alas, dear Hans! I am weary\nand sick to death.\" And poor little Otto began to weep silently in the\ndarkness.\n\n\"Aye, aye,\" said Hans, gruffly, \"it is no place for a little child\nto be. Canst thou climb, my little master? canst thou climb a knotted\nrope?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto, \"I can never climb again! See, Hans;\" and he flung\nback the covers from off him.\n\n\"I cannot see,\" said Hans, \"it is too dark.\"\n\n\"Then feel, dear Hans,\" said Otto.\n\nHans bent over the poor little white figure glimmering palely in the\ndarkness. Suddenly he drew back with a snarl like an angry wolf. \"Oh!\nthe black, bloody wretches!\" he cried, hoarsely; \"and have they done\nthat to thee, a little child?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Otto, \"the Baron Henry did it.\" And then again he began to\ncry.\n\n\"There, there,\" said Hans, roughly, \"weep no more. Thou shalt get away\nfrom here even if thou canst not climb; I myself will help thee. Thy\nfather is already waiting below the window here, and thou shalt soon be\nwith him. There, there, cry no more.\"\n\nWhile he was speaking Hans had stripped off his peddler's leathern\njacket, and there, around his body, was wrapped coil after coil of stout\nhempen rope tied in knots at short distances. He began unwinding the\nrope, and when he had done he was as thin as ever he had been before.\nNext he drew from the pouch that hung at his side a ball of fine cord\nand a leaden weight pierced by a hole, both of which he had brought with\nhim for the use to which he now put them. He tied the lead to the end of\nthe cord, then whirling the weight above his head, he flung it up toward\nthe window high above. Twice the piece of lead fell back again into the\nroom; the third time it flew out between the iron bars carrying the cord\nwith it. Hans held the ball in his hand and paid out the string as the\nweight carried it downward toward the ground beneath. Suddenly the cord\nstopped running. Hans jerked it and shook it, but it moved no farther.\n\"Pray heaven, little child,\" said he, \"that it hath reached the ground,\nfor if it hath not we are certainly lost.\"\n\n\"I do pray,\" said Otto, and he bowed his head.\n\nThen, as though in answer to his prayer, there came a twitch upon the\ncord.\n\n\"See,\" said Hans, \"they have heard thee up above in heaven; it was thy\nfather who did that.\" Quickly and deftly he tied the cord to the end of\nthe knotted rope; then he gave an answering jerk upon the string. The\nnext moment the rope was drawn up to the window and down the outside by\nthose below. Otto lay watching the rope as it crawled up to the window\nand out into the night like a great snake, while One-eyed Hans held the\nother end lest it should be drawn too far. At last it stopped. \"Good,\"\nmuttered Hans, as though to himself. \"The rope is long enough.\"\n\nHe waited for a few minutes and then, drawing upon the rope and finding\nthat it was held from below, he spat upon his hands and began slowly\nclimbing up to the window above. Winding his arm around the iron bars of\nthe grating that guarded it, he thrust his hand into the pouch that hung\nby his side, and drawing forth a file, fell to work cutting through all\nthat now lay between Otto and liberty.\n\nIt was slow, slow work, and it seemed to Otto as though Hans would never\nfinish his task, as lying upon his hard couch he watched that figure,\nblack against the sky, bending over its work. Now and then the file\nscreeched against the hard iron, and then Hans would cease for a moment,\nbut only to begin again as industriously as ever. Three or four times he\ntried the effects of his work, but still the iron held. At last he\nset his shoulder against it, and as Otto looked he saw the iron bend.\nSuddenly there was a sharp crack, and a piece of the grating went flying\nout into the night.\n\nHans tied the rope securely about the stump of the stout iron bar that\nyet remained, and then slid down again into the room below.\n\n\"My little lord,\" said he, \"dost thou think that if I carry thee, thou\nwilt be able and strong enough to cling to my neck?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto, \"methinks I will be able to do that.\"\n\n\"Then come,\" said Hans.\n\nHe stooped as he spoke, and gently lifting Otto from his rude and rugged\nbed he drew his broad leathern belt around them both, buckling it firmly\nand securely. \"It does not hurt thee?\" said he.\n\n\"Not much,\" whispered Otto faintly.\n\nThen Hans spat upon his hands, and began slowly climbing the rope.\n\nThey reached the edge of the window and there they rested for a moment,\nand Otto renewed his hold around the neck of the faithful Hans.\n\n\"And now art thou ready?\" said Hans\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto.\n\n\"Then courage,\" said Hans, and he turned and swung his leg over the\nabyss below.\n\nThe next moment they were hanging in mid-air.\n\nOtto looked down and gave a gasp. \"The mother of heaven bless us,\" he\nwhispered, and then closed his eyes, faint and dizzy at the sight of\nthat sheer depth beneath. Hans said nothing, but shutting his teeth\nand wrapping his legs around the rope, he began slowly descending, hand\nunder hand. Down, down, down he went, until to Otto, with his eyes shut\nand his head leaning upon Hans' shoulder, it seemed as though it could\nnever end. Down, down, down. Suddenly he felt Hans draw a deep breath;\nthere was a slight jar, and Otto opened his eyes; Hans was standing upon\nthe ground.\n\nA figure wrapped in a dark cloak arose from the shadow of the wall, and\ntook Otto in its arms. It was Baron Conrad.\n\n\"My son--my little child!\" he cried, in a choked, trembling voice, and\nthat was all. And Otto pressed his cheek against his father's and began\ncrying.\n\nSuddenly the Baron gave a sharp, fierce cry. \"Dear Heaven!\" he cried;\n\"what have they done to thee?\" But poor little Otto could not answer.\n\n\"Oh!\" gasped the Baron, in a strangled voice, \"my little child! my\nlittle child!\" And therewith he broke down, and his whole body shook\nwith fierce, dry sobs; for men in those days did not seek to hide their\ngrief as they do now, but were fierce and strong in the expression of\nthat as of all else.\n\n\"Never mind, dear father,\" whispered Otto; \"it did not hurt me so very\nmuch,\" and he pressed his lips against his father's cheek.\n\nLittle Otto had but one hand.\n\n\n\n\nXII. A Ride For Life.\n\nBut not yet was Otto safe, and all danger past and gone by. Suddenly, as\nthey stood there, the harsh clangor of a bell broke the silence of\nthe starry night above their heads, and as they raised their faces and\nlooked up, they saw lights flashing from window to window. Presently\ncame the sound of a hoarse voice shouting something that, from the\ndistance, they could not understand.\n\nOne-eyed Hans smote his hand upon his thigh. Look said he, \"here is\nwhat comes of having a soft heart in one's bosom. I overcame and bound a\nwatchman up yonder, and forced him to tell me where our young Baron lay.\nIt was on my mind to run my knife into him after he had told me every\nthing, but then, bethinking how the young Baron hated the thought of\nbloodshed, I said to myself, 'No, Hans, I will spare the villain's\nlife.' See now what comes of being merciful; here, by hook or by crook,\nthe fellow has loosed himself from his bonds, and brings the whole\ncastle about our ears like a nest of wasps.\"\n\n\"We must fly,\" said the Baron; \"for nothing else in the world is\nleft me, now that all have deserted me in this black time of trouble,\nexcepting these six faithful ones.\"\n\nHis voice was bitter, bitter, as he spoke; then stooping, he raised Otto\nin his arms, and bearing him gently, began rapidly descending the rocky\nslope to the level road that ran along the edge of the hill beneath.\nClose behind him followed the rest; Hans still grimed with soot and in\nhis bare feet. A little distance from the road and under the shade of\nthe forest trees, seven horses stood waiting. The Baron mounted upon\nhis great black charger, seating little Otto upon the saddle in front of\nhim. \"Forward!\" he cried, and away they clattered and out upon the road.\nThen--\"To St. Michaelsburg,\" said Baron Conrad, in his deep voice, and\nthe horses' heads were turned to the westward, and away they galloped\nthrough the black shadows of the forest, leaving Trutz-Drachen behind\nthem.\n\nBut still the sound of the alarm bell rang through the beating of the\nhorses' hoofs, and as Hans looked over his shoulder, he saw the light\nof torches flashing hither and thither along the outer walls in front of\nthe great barbican.\n\nIn Castle Trutz-Drachen all was confusion and uproar: flashing torches\nlit up the dull gray walls; horses neighed and stamped, and men shouted\nand called to one another in the bustle of making ready. Presently Baron\nHenry came striding along the corridor clad in light armor, which he had\nhastily donned when roused from his sleep by the news that his prisoner\nhad escaped. Below in the courtyard his horse was standing, and without\nwaiting for assistance, he swung himself into the saddle. Then away they\nall rode and down the steep path, armor ringing, swords clanking, and\niron-shod hoofs striking sparks of fire from the hard stones. At their\nhead rode Baron Henry; his triangular shield hung over his shoulder, and\nin his hand he bore a long, heavy, steel-pointed lance with a pennant\nflickering darkly from the end.\n\nAt the high-road at the base of the slope they paused, for they were at\na loss to know which direction the fugitives had taken; a half a score\nof the retainers leaped from their horses, and began hurrying about\nhither and thither, and up and down, like hounds searching for the lost\nscent, and all the time Baron Henry sat still as a rock in the midst of\nthe confusion.\n\nSuddenly a shout was raised from the forest just beyond the road; they\nhad come upon the place where the horses had been tied. It was an easy\nmatter to trace the way that Baron Conrad and his followers had taken\nthence back to the high-road, but there again they were at a loss. The\nroad ran straight as an arrow eastward and westward--had the fugitives\ntaken their way to the east or to the west?\n\nBaron Henry called his head-man, Nicholas Stein, to him, and the\ntwo spoke together for a while in an undertone. At last the Baron's\nlieutenant reined his horse back, and choosing first one and then\nanother, divided the company into two parties. The baron placed himself\nat the head of one band and Nicholas Stein at the head of the other.\n\"Forward!\" he cried, and away clattered the two companies of horsemen in\nopposite directions.\n\nIt was toward the westward that Baron Henry of Trutz-Drachen rode at the\nhead of his men.\n\nThe early springtide sun shot its rays of misty, yellow light across the\nrolling tops of the forest trees where the little birds were singing in\nthe glory of the May morning. But Baron Henry and his followers thought\nnothing of the beauty of the peaceful day, and heard nothing of the\nmultitudinous sound of the singing birds as, with a confused sound of\ngalloping hoofs, they swept along the highway, leaving behind them a\nslow-curling, low-trailing cloud of dust.\n\nAs the sun rose more full and warm, the misty wreaths began to dissolve,\nuntil at last they parted and rolled asunder like a white curtain and\nthere, before the pursuing horsemen, lay the crest of the mountain\ntoward which they were riding, and up which the road wound steeply.\n\n\"Yonder they are,\" cried a sudden voice behind Baron Henry of\nTrutz-Drachen, and at the cry all looked upward.\n\nFar away upon the mountain-side curled a cloud of dust, from the midst\nof which came the star-like flash of burnished armor gleaming in the\nsun.\n\nBaron Henry said never a word, but his lips curled in a grim smile.\n\nAnd as the mist wreaths parted One-eyed Hans looked behind and down\ninto the leafy valley beneath. \"Yonder they come,\" said he. \"They have\nfollowed sharply to gain so much upon us, even though our horses are\nwearied with all the travelling we have done hither and yon these five\ndays past. How far is it, Lord Baron, from here to Michaelsburg?\"\n\n\"About ten leagues,\" said the Baron, in a gloomy voice.\n\nHans puckered his mouth as though to whistle, but the Baron saw nothing\nof it, for he was gazing straight before him with a set and stony face.\nThose who followed him looked at one another, and the same thought was\nin the mind of each--how long would it be before those who pursued would\nclose the distance between them?\n\nWhen that happened it meant death to one and all.\n\nThey reached the crest of the hill, and down they dashed upon the other\nside; for there the road was smooth and level as it sloped away into the\nvalley, but it was in dead silence that they rode. Now and then those\nwho followed the Baron looked back over their shoulders. They had gained\na mile upon their pursuers when the helmeted heads rose above the crest\nof the mountain, but what was the gain of a mile with a smooth road\nbetween them, and fresh horses to weary ones?\n\nOn they rode and on they rode. The sun rose higher and higher, and\nhotter and hotter. There was no time to rest and water their panting\nhorses. Only once, when they crossed a shallow stretch of water, the\npoor animals bent their heads and caught a few gulps from the cool\nstream, and the One-eyed Hans washed a part of the soot from his hands\nand face. On and on they rode; never once did the Baron Conrad move his\nhead or alter that steadfast look as, gazing straight before him, he\nrode steadily forward along the endless stretch of road, with poor\nlittle Otto's yellow head and white face resting against his steel-clad\nshoulder--and St. Michaelsburg still eight leagues away.\n\nA little rise of ground lay before them, and as they climbed it, all,\nexcepting the baron, turned their heads as with one accord and looked\nbehind them. Then more than one heart failed, for through the leaves\nof the trees below, they caught the glint of armor of those who\nfollowed--not more than a mile away. The next moment they swept over the\ncrest, and there, below them, lay the broad shining river, and nearer a\ntributary stream spanned by a rude, narrow, three-arched, stone bridge\nwhere the road crossed the deep, slow-moving water.\n\nDown the slope plodded the weary horses, and so to the bridge-head.\n\n\"Halt,\" cried the baron suddenly, and drew rein.\n\nThe others stood bewildered. What did he mean to do? He turned to Hans\nand his blue eyes shone like steel.\n\n\"Hans,\" said he, in his deep voice, \"thou hast served me long and truly;\nwilt thou for this one last time do my bidding?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Hans, briefly.\n\n\"Swear it,\" said the Baron.\n\n\"I swear it,\" said Hans, and he drew the sign of the cross upon his\nheart.\n\n\"That is good,\" said the Baron, grimly. \"Then take thou this child,\nand with the others ride with all the speed that thou canst to St.\nMichaelsburg. Give the child into the charge of the Abbot Otto. Tell\nhim how that I have sworn fealty to the Emperor, and what I have gained\nthereby--my castle burnt, my people slain, and this poor, simple child,\nmy only son, mutilated by my enemy.\n\n\"And thou, my Lord Baron?\" said Hans.\n\n\"I will stay here,\" said the Baron, quietly, \"and keep back those who\nfollow as long as God will give me grace so to do.\"\n\nA murmur of remonstrance rose among the faithful few who were with\nhim, two of whom were near of kin. But Conrad of Drachenhausen turned\nfiercely upon them.\n\n\"How now,\" said he, \"have I fallen so low in my troubles that even ye\ndare to raise your voices against me? By the good Heaven, I will begin\nmy work here by slaying the first man who dares to raise word against\nmy bidding.\" Then he turned from them. \"Here, Hans,\" said he, \"take the\nboy; and remember, knave, what thou hast sworn.\"\n\nHe pressed Otto close to his breast in one last embrace. \"My little\nchild,\" he murmured, \"try not to hate thy father when thou thinkest of\nhim hereafter, even though he be hard and bloody as thou knowest.\"\n\nBut with his suffering and weakness, little Otto knew nothing of what\nwas passing; it was only as in a faint flickering dream that he lived in\nwhat was done around him.\n\n\"Farewell, Otto,\" said the Baron, but Otto's lips only moved faintly in\nanswer. His father kissed him upon either cheek. \"Come, Hans,\" said\nhe, hastily, \"take him hence;\" and he loosed Otto's arms from about his\nneck.\n\nHans took Otto upon the saddle in front of him.\n\n\"Oh! my dear Lord Baron,\" said he, and then stopped with a gulp, and\nturned his grotesquely twitching face aside.\n\n\"Go,\" said the Baron, harshly, \"there is no time to lose in woman's\ntears.\"\n\n\"Farewell, Conrad! farewell, Conrad!\" said his two kinsmen, and coming\nforward they kissed him upon the cheek then they turned and rode away\nafter Hans, and Baron Conrad was left alone to face his mortal foe.\n\n\n\n\nXIII. How Baron Conrad Held the Bridge.\n\nAs the last of his followers swept around the curving road and was lost\nto sight, Baron Conrad gave himself a shake, as though to drive away the\nthoughts that lay upon him. Then he rode slowly forward to the middle of\nthe bridge, where he wheeled his horse so as to face his coming enemies.\nHe lowered the vizor of his helmet and bolted it to its place, and then\nsaw that sword and dagger were loose in the scabbard and easy to draw\nwhen the need for drawing should arise.\n\n\nDown the steep path from the hill above swept the pursuing horsemen.\nDown the steep path to the bridge-head and there drew rein; for in the\nmiddle of the narrow way sat the motionless, steel-clad figure upon the\ngreat war-horse, with wide, red, panting nostrils, and body streaked\nwith sweat and flecked with patches of foam.\n\nOne side of the roadway of the bridge was guarded by a low stone wall;\nthe other side was naked and open and bare to the deep, slow-moving\nwater beneath. It was a dangerous place to attack a desperate man clad\nin armor of proof.\n\n\"Forward!\" cried Baron Henry, but not a soul stirred in answer, and\nstill the iron-clad figure sat motionless and erect upon the panting\nhorse.\n\n\"How,\" cried the Baron Henry, \"are ye afraid of one man? Then follow\nme!\" and he spurred forward to the bridge-head. But still no one moved\nin answer, and the Lord of Trutz-Drachen reined back his horse again.\nHe wheeled his horse and glared round upon the stolid faces of his\nfollowers, until his eyes seemed fairly to blaze with passion beneath\nthe bars of his vizor.\n\nBaron Conrad gave a roar of laughter. \"How now,\" he cried; \"are ye all\nafraid of one man? Is there none among ye that dares come forward and\nmeet me? I know thee, Baron Henry thou art not afraid to cut off the\nhand of a little child. Hast thou not now the courage to face the\nfather?\"\n\nBaron Henry gnashed his teeth with rage as he glared around upon the\nfaces of his men-at-arms. Suddenly his eye lit upon one of them. \"Ha!\nCarl Spigler,\" he cried, \"thou hast thy cross-bow with thee;--shoot me\ndown yonder dog! Nay,\" he said, \"thou canst do him no harm under his\narmor; shoot the horse upon which he sits.\"\n\nBaron Conrad heard the speech. \"Oh! thou coward villain!\" he cried,\n\"stay; do not shoot the good horse. I will dismount and fight ye upon\nfoot.\" Thereupon, armed as he was, he leaped clashing from his horse and\nturning the animal's head, gave it a slap upon the flank. The good horse\nfirst trotted and then walked to the further end of the bridge, where it\nstopped and began cropping at the grass that grew beside the road.\n\n\"Now then!\" cried Baron Henry, fiercely, \"now then, ye cannot fear him,\nvillains! Down with him! forward!\"\n\nSlowly the troopers spurred their horses forward upon the bridge and\ntoward that one figure that, grasping tightly the great two-handed\nsword, stood there alone guarding the passage.\n\nThen Baron Conrad whirled the great blade above his head, until it\ncaught the sunlight and flashed again. He did not wait for the attack,\nbut when the first of the advancing horsemen had come within a few feet\nof him, he leaped with a shout upon them. The fellow thrust at him with\nhis lance, and the Baron went staggering a few feet back, but instantly\nhe recovered himself and again leaped forward. The great sword flashed\nin the air, whistling; it fell, and the nearest man dropped his lance,\nclattering, and with a loud, inarticulate cry, grasped the mane of his\nhorse with both hands. Again the blade whistled in the air, and this\ntime it was stained with red. Again it fell, and with another shrill cry\nthe man toppled headlong beneath the horse's feet. The next instant they\nwere upon him, each striving to strike at the one figure, to ride him\ndown, or to thrust him down with their lances. There was no room now to\nswing the long blade, but holding the hilt in both hands, Baron Conrad\nthrust with it as though it were a lance, stabbing at horse or man, it\nmattered not. Crowded upon the narrow roadway of the bridge, those who\nattacked had not only to guard themselves against the dreadful strokes\nof that terrible sword, but to keep their wounded horses (rearing and\nmad with fright) from toppling bodily over with them into the water\nbeneath.\n\nPresently the cry was raised, \"Back! back!\" And those nearest the Baron\nbegan reining in their horses. \"Forward!\" roared Baron Henry, from the\nmidst of the crowd; but in spite of his command, and even the blows that\nhe gave, those behind were borne back by those in front, struggling and\nshouting, and the bridge was cleared again excepting for three figures\nthat lay motionless upon the roadway, and that one who, with the\nbrightness of his armor dimmed and stained, leaned panting against the\nwall of the bridge.\n\nThe Baron Henry raged like a madman. Gnashing his teeth together, he\nrode back a little way; then turning and couching his lance, he suddenly\nclapped spurs to his horse, and the next instant came thundering down\nupon his solitary enemy.\n\nBaron Conrad whirled his sword in the air, as he saw the other coming\nlike a thunderbolt upon him; he leaped aside, and the lance passed close\nto him. As it passed he struck, and the iron point flew from the shaft\nof the spear at the blow, and fell clattering upon the stone roadway of\nthe bridge.\n\nBaron Henry drew in his horse until it rested upon its haunches, then\nslowly reined it backward down the bridge, still facing his foe,\nand still holding the wooden stump of the lance in his hand. At the\nbridge-head he flung it from him.\n\n\"Another lance!\" he cried, hoarsely. One was silently reached to him\nand he took it, his hand trembling with rage. Again he rode to a little\ndistance and wheeled his horse; then, driving his steel spurs into its\nquivering side, he came again thundering down upon the other. Once more\nthe terrible sword whirled in the air and fell, but this time the lance\nwas snatched to one side and the blow fell harmlessly. The next instant,\nand with a twitch of the bridle-rein, the horse struck full and fair\nagainst the man.\n\nConrad of Drachenhausen was whirled backward and downward, and the cruel\niron hoofs crashed over his prostrate body, as horse and man passed with\na rush beyond him and to the bridge-head beyond. A shout went up from\nthose who stood watching. The next moment the prostrate figure rose and\nstaggered blindly to the side of the bridge, and stood leaning against\nthe stone wall.\n\nAt the further end of the bridge Baron Henry had wheeled his horse. Once\nagain he couched lance, and again he drove down upon his bruised and\nwounded enemy. This time the lance struck full and fair, and those who\nwatched saw the steel point pierce the iron breast-plate and then snap\nshort, leaving the barbed point within the wound.\n\nBaron Conrad sunk to his knees and the Roderburg, looming upon his horse\nabove him, unsheathed his sword to finish the work he had begun.\n\nThen those who stood looking on saw a wondrous thing happen: the wounded\nman rose suddenly to his feet, and before his enemy could strike he\nleaped, with a great and bitter cry of agony and despair, upon him as he\nsat in the saddle above.\n\nHenry of Trutz-Drachen grasped at his horse's mane, but the attack\nwas so fierce, so sudden, and so unexpected that before he could save\nhimself he was dragged to one side and fell crashing in his armor upon\nthe stone roadway of the bridge.\n\n\"The dragon! the dragon!\" roared Baron Conrad, in a voice of thunder,\nand with the energy of despair he dragged his prostrate foe toward the\nopen side of the bridge.\n\n\"Forward!\" cried the chief of the Trutz-Drachen men, and down they rode\nupon the struggling knights to the rescue of their master in this new\ndanger. But they were too late.\n\nThere was a pause at the edge of the bridge, for Baron Henry had gained\nhis feet and, stunned and bewildered as he was by the suddenness of his\nfall, he was now struggling fiercely, desperately. For a moment they\nstood swaying backward and forward, clasped in one another's arms, the\nblood from the wounded man's breast staining the armor of both. The\nmoment passed and then, with a shower of stones and mortar from beneath\ntheir iron-shod heels, they toppled and fell; there was a thunderous\nsplash in the water below, and as the men-at-arms came hurrying up and\npeered with awe-struck faces over the parapet of the bridge, they saw\nthe whirling eddies sweep down with the current of the stream, a few\nbubbles rise to the surface of the water, and then--nothing; for the\nsmooth river flowed onward as silently as ever.\n\nPresently a loud voice burst through the awed hush that followed. It\ncame from William of Roderburg, Baron Henry's kinsman.\n\n\"Forward!\" he cried. A murmur of voices from the others was all the\nanswer that he received. \"Forward!\" cried the young man again, \"the boy\nand those with him are not so far away but that we might yet catch up\nwith them.\"\n\nThen one of the men spoke up in answer--a man with a seamed,\nweather-beaten face and crisp grizzled hair. \"Nay,\" said he, \"our Lord\nBaron is gone, and this is no quarrel of ours; here be four of us that\nare wounded and three I misdoubt that are dead; why should we follow\nfurther only to suffer more blows for no gain?\" A growl of assent rose\nfrom those that stood around, and William of Roderburg saw that nothing\nmore was to be done by the Trutz-Dragons that day.\n\n\n\n\nXIV. How Otto Saw the Great Emperor.\n\nThrough weakness and sickness and faintness, Otto had lain in a half\nswoon through all that long journey under the hot May sun. It was as in\na dreadful nightmare that he had heard on and on and on that monotonous\nthrobbing of galloping hoofs upon the ground; had felt that last kiss\nthat his father had given him upon his cheek. Then the onward ride\nagain, until all faded away into a dull mist and he knew no more. When\nnext he woke it was with the pungent smell of burned vinegar in his\nnostrils and with the feeling of a cool napkin bathing his brow. He\nopened his eyes and then closed them again, thinking he must have been\nin a dream, for he lay in his old room at the peaceful monastery of the\nWhite Cross on the hill; the good Father Abbot sat near by, gazing upon\nhis face with the old absent student look, Brother John sat in the deep\nwindow seat also gazing at him, and Brother Theodore, the leech of the\nmonastery, sat beside him bathing his head. Beside these old familiar\nfaces were the faces of those who had been with him in that long flight;\nthe One-eyed Hans, old Master Nicholas his kinsman, and the others.\nSo he closed his eyes, thinking that maybe it was all a dream. But the\nsharp throbbing of the poor stump at his wrist soon taught him that he\nwas still awake.\n\n\"Am I then really home in St. Michaelsburg again?\" he murmured, without\nunclosing his eyes.\n\nBrother Theodore began snuffling through his nose; there was a pause.\n\"Yes,\" said the old Abbot at last, and his gentle voice trembled as\nhe spoke; \"yes, my dear little child, thou art back again in thine own\nhome; thou hast not been long out in the great world, but truly thou\nhast had a sharp and bitter trial of it.\"\n\n\"But they will not take me away again, will they?\" said Otto quickly,\nunclosing his blue eyes.\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Abbot, gently; \"not until thou art healed in body and\nart ready and willing to go.\"\n\nThree months and more had passed, and Otto was well again; and now,\nescorted by One-eyed Hans and those faithful few who had clung to the\nBaron Conrad through his last few bitter days, he was riding into the\nquaint old town of Nurnburg; for the Emperor Rudolph was there at that\ntime, waiting for King Ottocar of Bohemia to come thither and answer\nthe imperial summons before the Council, and Otto was travelling to the\ncourt.\n\nAs they rode in through the gates of the town, Otto looked up at the\nhigh-peaked houses with their overhanging gables, the like of which he\nhad never seen before, and he stared with his round blue eyes at seeing\nthem so crowded together along the length of the street. But most of\nall he wondered at the number of people that passed hither and thither,\njostling each other in their hurry, and at the tradesmen's booths\nopening upon the street with the wonderful wares hanging within; armor\nat the smiths, glittering ornaments at the goldsmiths, and rich fabrics\nof silks and satins at the mercers. He had never seen anything so rich\nand grand in all of his life, for little Otto had never been in a town\nbefore.\n\n\"Oh! look,\" he cried, \"at that wonderful lady; see, holy father! sure\nthe Emperor's wife can be no finer than that lady.\"\n\nThe Abbot smiled. \"Nay, Otto,\" said he, \"that is but a burgher's wife or\ndaughter; the ladies at the Emperor's court are far grander than such as\nshe.\"\n\n\"So!\" said Otto, and then fell silent with wonder.\n\nAnd now, at last the great moment had come when little Otto with his own\neyes was to behold the mighty Emperor who ruled over all the powerful\nkingdoms of Germany and Austria, and Italy and Bohemia, and other\nkingdoms and principalities and states. His heart beat so that he could\nhardly speak as, for a moment, the good Abbot who held him by the hand\nstopped outside of the arrased doorway to whisper some last instructions\ninto his ear. Then they entered the apartment.\n\nIt was a long, stone-paved room. The floor was covered with rich rugs\nand the walls were hung with woven tapestry wherein were depicted\nknights and ladies in leafy gardens and kings and warriors at battle.\nA long row of high glazed windows extended along the length of the\napartment, flooding it with the mellow light of the autumn day. At\nthe further end of the room, far away, and standing by a great carved\nchimney place wherein smouldered the remains of a fire, stood a group of\nnobles in gorgeous dress of velvet and silks, and with glittering golden\nchains hung about their necks.\n\nOne figure stood alone in front of the great yawning fireplace. His\nhands were clasped behind him, and his look bent thoughtfully upon the\nfloor. He was dressed only in a simple gray robe without ornament or\nadornment, a plain leathern belt girded his waist, and from it hung a\nsword with a bone hilt encased in a brown leathern scabbard. A noble\nstag-hound lay close behind him, curled up upon the floor, basking in\nthe grateful warmth of the fire.\n\nAs the Father Abbot and Otto drew near he raised his head and looked\nat them. It was a plain, homely face that Otto saw, with a wrinkled\nforehead and a long mouth drawn down at the corners. It was the face of\na good, honest burgher burdened with the cares of a prosperous trade.\n\"Who can he be,\" thought Otto, \"and why does the poor man stand there\namong all the great nobles?\"\n\nBut the Abbot walked straight up to him and kneeled upon the floor,\nand little Otto, full of wonder, did the same. It was the great Emperor\nRudolph.\n\n\"Who have we here,\" said the Emperor, and he bent his brow upon the\nAbbot and the boy.\n\n\"Sire,\" said Abbot Otto, \"we have humbly besought you by petition, in\nthe name of your late vassal, Baron Conrad of Vuelph of Drachenhausen,\nfor justice to this his son, the Baron Otto, whom, sire, as you may see,\nhath been cruelly mutilated at the hands of Baron Henry of Roderburg of\nTrutz-Drachen. He hath moreover been despoiled of his lands, his castle\nburnt, and his household made prisoner.\"\n\nThe Emperor frowned until the shaggy eyebrows nearly hid the keen gray\ntwinkle of the eyes beneath. \"Yes,\" said he, \"I do remember me of\nthat petition, and have given it consideration both in private and in\ncouncil.\" He turned to the group of listening nobles. \"Look,\" said he,\n\"at this little child marred by the inhumanity and the cruelty of those\nrobber villains. By heavens! I will put down their lawless rapine, if I\nhave to give every castle from the north to the south to the flames and\nto the sword.\" Then turning to Otto again, \"Poor little child,\" said he,\n\"thy wrongs shall be righted, and so far as they are able, those cruel\nRoderburgs shall pay thee penny for penny, and grain for grain, for what\nthou hast lost; and until such indemnity hath been paid the family of\nthe man who wrought this deed shall be held as surety.\"\n\nLittle Otto looked up in the kind, rugged face above him. \"Nay, Lord\nEmperor,\" said he, in his quaint, quiet way, \"there are but two in the\nfamily--the mother and the daughter--and I have promised to marry the\nlittle girl when she and I are old enough; so, if you please, I would\nnot have harm happen to her.\"\n\nThe Emperor continued to look down at the kneeling boy, and at last he\ngave a short, dry laugh. \"So be it,\" said he, \"thy plan is not without\nits wisdom. Mayhap it is all for the best that the affair should be\nended thus peacefully. The estates of the Roderburgs shall be held in\ntrust for thee until thou art come of age; otherwise it shall be as thou\nhast proposed, the little maiden shall be taken into ward under our own\ncare. And as to thee--art thou willing that I should take thee under my\nown charge in the room of thy father, who is dead?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto, simply, \"I am willing, for it seems to me that thou\nart a good man.\"\n\nThe nobles who stood near smiled at the boy's speech. As for the\nEmperor, he laughed outright. \"I give thee thanks, my Lord Baron,\" said\nhe; \"there is no one in all my court who has paid me greater courtesy\nthan that.\"\n\nSo comes the end of our tale.\n\nBut perhaps you may like to know what happened afterward, for no one\ncares to leave the thread of a story without tying a knot in it.\n\nEight years had passed, and Otto grew up to manhood in the Emperor's\ncourt, and was with him through war and peace.\n\nBut he himself never drew sword or struck a blow, for the right hand\nthat hung at his side was of pure silver, and the hard, cold fingers\nnever closed. Folks called him \"Otto of the Silver Hand,\" but perhaps\nthere was another reason than that for the name that had been given him,\nfor the pure, simple wisdom that the old monks of the White Cross on\nthe hill had taught him, clung to him through all the honors that the\nEmperor bestowed upon his favorite, and as he grew older his words were\nlistened to and weighed by those who were high in Council, and even by\nthe Emperor himself.\n\nAnd now for the end of all.\n\nOne day Otto stood uncertainly at the doorway of a room in the imperial\ncastle, hesitating before he entered; and yet there was nothing so very\ndreadful within, only one poor girl whose heart fluttered more than his.\nPoor little Pauline, whom he had not seen since that last day in the\nblack cell at Trutz-Drachen.\n\nAt last he pushed aside the hangings and entered the room.\n\nShe was sitting upon a rude bench beside the window, looking at him out\nof her great, dark eyes.\n\nHe stopped short and stood for a moment confused and silent; for he had\nno thought in his mind but of the little girl whom he had last seen, and\nfor a moment he stood confused before the fair maiden with her great,\nbeautiful dark eyes.\n\nShe on her part beheld a tall, slender youth with curling, golden hair,\none hand white and delicate, the other of pure and shining silver.\n\nHe came to her and took her hand and set it to his lips, and all that\nshe could do was to gaze with her great, dark eyes upon the hero of whom\nshe had heard so many talk; the favorite of the Emperor; the wise young\nOtto of the Silver Hand.\n\n\n\n\nAfterword\n\nThe ruins of Drachenhausen were rebuilt, for the walls were as sound as\never, though empty and gaping to the sky; but it was no longer the den\nof a robber baron for beneath the scutcheon over the great gate was\ncarved a new motto of the Vuelphs; a motto which the Emperor Rudolph\nhimself had given:\n\n\"Manus argentea quam manus ferrea melior est.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Otto of the Silver Hand, by Howard Pyle",

To his sombre\nand cynical spirit all popular applause was always abhorrent, and\nnothing amused him more at the end of a successful case than to hand\nover the actual exposure to some orthodox official, and to listen with\na mocking smile to the general chorus of misplaced congratulation.  It\nwas indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend and certainly not\nany lack of interesting material which has caused me of late years to\nlay very few of my records before the public.  My participation in some\nof his adventures was always a privilege which entailed discretion and\nreticence upon me.\n\nIt was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram\nfrom Holmes last Tuesday--he has never been known to write where a\ntelegram would serve--in the following terms:\n\nWhy not tell them of the Cornish horror--strangest case I have handled.\n\nI have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter\nfresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should\nrecount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may\narrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the\ncase and to lay the narrative before my readers.\n\nIt was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that Holmes's iron\nconstitution showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of constant\nhard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by occasional\nindiscretions of his own.  In March of that year Dr. Moore Agar, of\nHarley Street, whose dramatic introduction to Holmes I may some day\nrecount, gave positive injunctions that the famous private agent lay\naside all his cases and surrender himself to complete rest if he wished\nto avert an absolute breakdown.  The state of his health was not a\nmatter in which he himself took the faintest interest, for his mental\ndetachment was absolute, but he was induced at last, on the threat of\nbeing permanently disqualified from work, to give himself a complete\nchange of scene and air.  Thus it was that in the early spring of that\nyear we found ourselves together in a small cottage near Poldhu Bay, at\nthe further extremity of the Cornish peninsula.\n\nIt was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well suited to the grim\nhumour of my patient.  From the windows of our little whitewashed\nhouse, which stood high upon a grassy headland, we looked down upon the\nwhole sinister semicircle of Mounts Bay, that old death trap of sailing\nvessels, with its fringe of black cliffs and surge-swept reefs on which\ninnumerable seamen have met their end.  With a northerly breeze it lies\nplacid and sheltered, inviting the storm-tossed craft to tack into it\nfor rest and protection.\n\nThen come the sudden swirl round of the wind, the blistering gale from\nthe south-west, the dragging anchor, the lee shore, and the last battle\nin the creaming breakers.  The wise mariner stands far out from that\nevil place.\n\nOn the land side our surroundings were as sombre as on the sea. It was\na country of rolling moors, lonely and dun-colored, with an occasional\nchurch tower to mark the site of some old-world village.  In every\ndirection upon these moors there were traces of some vanished race\nwhich had passed utterly away, and left as its sole record strange\nmonuments of stone, irregular mounds which contained the burned ashes\nof the dead, and curious earthworks which hinted at prehistoric strife.\nThe glamour and mystery of the place, with its sinister atmosphere of\nforgotten nations, appealed to the imagination of my friend, and he\nspent much of his time in long walks and solitary meditations upon the\nmoor. The ancient Cornish language had also arrested his attention, and\nhe had, I remember, conceived the idea that it was akin to the\nChaldean, and had been largely derived from the Phoenician traders in\ntin.  He had received a consignment of books upon philology and was\nsettling down to develop this thesis when suddenly, to my sorrow and to\nhis unfeigned delight, we found ourselves, even in that land of dreams,\nplunged into a problem at our very doors which was more intense, more\nengrossing, and infinitely more mysterious than any of those which had\ndriven us from London.  Our simple life and peaceful, healthy routine\nwere violently interrupted, and we were precipitated into the midst of\na series of events which caused the utmost excitement not only in\nCornwall but throughout the whole west of England. Many of my readers\nmay retain some recollection of what was called at the time \"The\nCornish Horror,\" though a most imperfect account of the matter reached\nthe London press. Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true\ndetails of this inconceivable affair to the public.\n\nI have said that scattered towers marked the villages which dotted this\npart of Cornwall.  The nearest of these was the hamlet of Tredannick\nWollas, where the cottages of a couple of hundred inhabitants clustered\nround an ancient, moss-grown church.  The vicar of the parish, Mr.\nRoundhay, was something of an archaeologist, and as such Holmes had\nmade his acquaintance. He was a middle-aged man, portly and affable,\nwith a considerable fund of local lore.  At his invitation we had taken\ntea at the vicarage and had come to know, also, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis,\nan independent gentleman, who increased the clergyman's scanty\nresources by taking rooms in his large, straggling house.  The vicar,\nbeing a bachelor, was glad to come to such an arrangement, though he\nhad little in common with his lodger, who was a thin, dark, spectacled\nman, with a stoop which gave the impression of actual, physical\ndeformity.  I remember that during our short visit we found the vicar\ngarrulous, but his lodger strangely reticent, a sad-faced,\nintrospective man, sitting with averted eyes, brooding apparently upon\nhis own affairs.\n\nThese were the two men who entered abruptly into our little\nsitting-room on Tuesday, March the 16th, shortly after our breakfast\nhour, as we were smoking together, preparatory to our daily excursion\nupon the moors.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes,\" said the vicar in an agitated voice, \"the most\nextraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night. It is\nthe most unheard-of business.  We can only regard it as a special\nProvidence that you should chance to be here at the time, for in all\nEngland you are the one man we need.\"\n\nI glared at the intrusive vicar with no very friendly eyes; but Holmes\ntook his pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like an old hound\nwho hears the view-halloa.  He waved his hand to the sofa, and our\npalpitating visitor with his agitated companion sat side by side upon\nit.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis was more self-contained than the clergyman,\nbut the twitching of his thin hands and the brightness of his dark eyes\nshowed that they shared a common emotion.\n\n\"Shall I speak or you?\" he asked of the vicar.\n\n\"Well, as you seem to have made the discovery, whatever it may be, and\nthe vicar to have had it second-hand, perhaps you had better do the\nspeaking,\" said Holmes.\n\nI glanced at the hastily clad clergyman, with the formally dressed\nlodger seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise which Holmes's\nsimple deduction had brought to their faces.\n\n\"Perhaps I had best say a few words first,\" said the vicar, \"and then\nyou can judge if you will listen to the details from Mr. Tregennis, or\nwhether we should not hasten at once to the scene of this mysterious\naffair.  I may explain, then, that our friend here spent last evening\nin the company of his two brothers, Owen and George, and of his sister\nBrenda, at their house of Tredannick Wartha, which is near the old\nstone cross upon the moor.  He left them shortly after ten o'clock,\nplaying cards round the dining-room table, in excellent health and\nspirits. This morning, being an early riser, he walked in that\ndirection before breakfast and was overtaken by the carriage of Dr.\nRichards, who explained that he had just been sent for on a most urgent\ncall to Tredannick Wartha.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis naturally went with\nhim.  When he arrived at Tredannick Wartha he found an extraordinary\nstate of things.  His two brothers and his sister were seated round the\ntable exactly as he had left them, the cards still spread in front of\nthem and the candles burned down to their sockets.  The sister lay back\nstone-dead in her chair, while the two brothers sat on each side of her\nlaughing, shouting, and singing, the senses stricken clean out of them.\nAll three of them, the dead woman and the two demented men, retained\nupon their faces an expression of the utmost horror--a convulsion of\nterror which was dreadful to look upon.  There was no sign of the\npresence of anyone in the house, except Mrs. Porter, the old cook and\nhousekeeper, who declared that she had slept deeply and heard no sound\nduring the night.  Nothing had been stolen or disarranged, and there is\nabsolutely no explanation of what the horror can be which has\nfrightened a woman to death and two strong men out of their senses.\nThere is the situation, Mr. Holmes, in a nutshell, and if you can help\nus to clear it up you will have done a great work.\"\n\nI had hoped that in some way I could coax my companion back into the\nquiet which had been the object of our journey; but one glance at his\nintense face and contracted eyebrows told me how vain was now the\nexpectation.  He sat for some little time in silence, absorbed in the\nstrange drama which had broken in upon our peace.\n\n\"I will look into this matter,\" he said at last.  \"On the face of it,\nit would appear to be a case of a very exceptional nature. Have you\nbeen there yourself, Mr. Roundhay?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Holmes.  Mr. Tregennis brought back the account to the\nvicarage, and I at once hurried over with him to consult you.\"\n\n\"How far is it to the house where this singular tragedy occurred?\"\n\n\"About a mile inland.\"\n\n\"Then we shall walk over together.  But before we start I must ask you\na few questions, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis.\"\n\nThe other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that his\nmore controlled excitement was even greater than the obtrusive emotion\nof the clergyman.  He sat with a pale, drawn face, his anxious gaze\nfixed upon Holmes, and his thin hands clasped convulsively together.\nHis pale lips quivered as he listened to the dreadful experience which\nhad befallen his family, and his dark eyes seemed to reflect something\nof the horror of the scene.\n\n\"Ask what you like, Mr. Holmes,\" said he eagerly.  \"It is a bad thing\nto speak of, but I will answer you the truth.\"\n\n\"Tell me about last night.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar has said, and my elder\nbrother George proposed a game of whist afterwards.  We sat down about\nnine o'clock.  It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to go.  I left\nthem all round the table, as merry as could be.\"\n\n\"Who let you out?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out.  I shut the hall\ndoor behind me.  The window of the room in which they sat was closed,\nbut the blind was not drawn down.  There was no change in door or\nwindow this morning, or any reason to think that any stranger had been\nto the house.  Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and\nBrenda lying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm of the\nchair.  I'll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as\nI live.\"\n\n\"The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable,\" said\nHolmes.  \"I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any\nway account for them?\"\n\n\"It's devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis. \"It is\nnot of this world.  Something has come into that room which has dashed\nthe light of reason from their minds.  What human contrivance could do\nthat?\"\n\n\"I fear,\" said Holmes, \"that if the matter is beyond humanity it is\ncertainly beyond me.  Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations\nbefore we fall back upon such a theory as this.  As to yourself, Mr.\nTregennis, I take it you were divided in some way from your family,\nsince they lived together and you had rooms apart?\"\n\n\"That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. We\nwere a family of tin-miners at Redruth, but we sold our venture to a\ncompany, and so retired with enough to keep us.  I won't deny that\nthere was some feeling about the division of the money and it stood\nbetween us for a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and we\nwere the best of friends together.\"\n\n\"Looking back at the evening which you spent together, does anything\nstand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the\ntragedy?  Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which can help\nme.\"\n\n\"There is nothing at all, sir.\"\n\n\"Your people were in their usual spirits?\"\n\n\"Never better.\"\n\n\"Were they nervous people?  Did they ever show any apprehension of\ncoming danger?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?\"\n\nMortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a moment.\n\n\"There is one thing occurs to me,\" said he at last.  \"As we sat at the\ntable my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being my\npartner at cards, was facing it.  I saw him once look hard over my\nshoulder, so I turned round and looked also.  The blind was up and the\nwindow shut, but I could just make out the bushes on the lawn, and it\nseemed to me for a moment that I saw something moving among them.  I\ncouldn't even say if it was man or animal, but I just thought there was\nsomething there.  When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me\nthat he had the same feeling.  That is all that I can say.\"\n\n\"Did you not investigate?\"\n\n\"No; the matter passed as unimportant.\"\n\n\"You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?\"\n\n\"None at all.\"\n\n\"I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning.\"\n\n\"I am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast. This\nmorning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook\nme.  He told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a boy down with an urgent\nmessage.  I sprang in beside him and we drove on. When we got there we\nlooked into that dreadful room.  The candles and the fire must have\nburned out hours before, and they had been sitting there in the dark\nuntil dawn had broken.  The doctor said Brenda must have been dead at\nleast six hours.  There were no signs of violence.  She just lay across\nthe arm of the chair with that look on her face.  George and Owen were\nsinging snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes.  Oh, it\nwas awful to see!  I couldn't stand it, and the doctor was as white as\na sheet.  Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we\nnearly had him on our hands as well.\"\n\n\"Remarkable--most remarkable!\" said Holmes, rising and taking his hat.\n\"I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha without\nfurther delay.  I confess that I have seldom known a case which at\nfirst sight presented a more singular problem.\"\n\n\nOur proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the\ninvestigation.  It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident\nwhich left the most sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to\nthe spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding,\ncountry lane.  While we made our way along it we heard the rattle of a\ncarriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass.  As it drove\nby us I caught a glimpse through the closed window of a horribly\ncontorted, grinning face glaring out at us.  Those staring eyes and\ngnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.\n\n\"My brothers!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis, white to his lips. \"They are\ntaking them to Helston.\"\n\nWe looked with horror after the black carriage, lumbering upon its way.\nThen we turned our steps towards this ill-omened house in which they\nhad met their strange fate.\n\nIt was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage, with\na considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air, well\nfilled with spring flowers.  Towards this garden the window of the\nsitting-room fronted, and from it, according to Mortimer Tregennis,\nmust have come that thing of evil which had by sheer horror in a single\ninstant blasted their minds.  Holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully\namong the flower-plots and along the path before we entered the porch.\nSo absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled over\nthe watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our feet and the\ngarden path.  Inside the house we were met by the elderly Cornish\nhousekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the aid of a young girl, looked\nafter the wants of the family.  She readily answered all Holmes's\nquestions.  She had heard nothing in the night.  Her employers had all\nbeen in excellent spirits lately, and she had never known them more\ncheerful and prosperous.  She had fainted with horror upon entering the\nroom in the morning and seeing that dreadful company round the table.\nShe had, when she recovered, thrown open the window to let the morning\nair in, and had run down to the lane, whence she sent a farm-lad for\nthe doctor.  The lady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see her.\nIt took four strong men to get the brothers into the asylum carriage.\nShe would not herself stay in the house another day and was starting\nthat very afternoon to rejoin her family at St. Ives.\n\nWe ascended the stairs and viewed the body.  Miss Brenda Tregennis had\nbeen a very beautiful girl, though now verging upon middle age.  Her\ndark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death, but there still\nlingered upon it something of that convulsion of horror which had been\nher last human emotion.  From her bedroom we descended to the\nsitting-room, where this strange tragedy had actually occurred.  The\ncharred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate.  On the table\nwere the four guttered and burned-out candles, with the cards scattered\nover its surface.  The chairs had been moved back against the walls,\nbut all else was as it had been the night before.  Holmes paced with\nlight, swift steps about the room; he sat in the various chairs,\ndrawing them up and reconstructing their positions.  He tested how much\nof the garden was visible; he examined the floor, the ceiling, and the\nfireplace; but never once did I see that sudden brightening of his eyes\nand tightening of his lips which would have told me that he saw some\ngleam of light in this utter darkness.\n\n\"Why a fire?\" he asked once.  \"Had they always a fire in this small\nroom on a spring evening?\"\n\nMortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For that\nreason, after his arrival, the fire was lit.  \"What are you going to do\nnow, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked.\n\nMy friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm.  \"I think, Watson, that\nI shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning which you have so often\nand so justly condemned,\" said he.  \"With your permission, gentlemen,\nwe will now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that any new\nfactor is likely to come to our notice here.  I will turn the facts\nover in my mind, Mr. Tregennis, and should anything occur to me I will\ncertainly communicate with you and the vicar.  In the meantime I wish\nyou both good-morning.\"\n\nIt was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that Holmes\nbroke his complete and absorbed silence.  He sat coiled in his\narmchair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid the blue\nswirl of his tobacco smoke, his black brows drawn down, his forehead\ncontracted, his eyes vacant and far away.  Finally he laid down his\npipe and sprang to his feet.\n\n\"It won't do, Watson!\" said he with a laugh.  \"Let us walk along the\ncliffs together and search for flint arrows.  We are more likely to\nfind them than clues to this problem.  To let the brain work without\nsufficient material is like racing an engine.  It racks itself to\npieces.  The sea air, sunshine, and patience, Watson--all else will\ncome.\n\n\"Now, let us calmly define our position, Watson,\" he continued as we\nskirted the cliffs together.  \"Let us get a firm grip of the very\nlittle which we DO know, so that when fresh facts arise we may be ready\nto fit them into their places.  I take it, in the first place, that\nneither of us is prepared to admit diabolical intrusions into the\naffairs of men.  Let us begin by ruling that entirely out of our minds.\nVery good.  There remain three persons who have been grievously\nstricken by some conscious or unconscious human agency.  That is firm\nground.  Now, when did this occur?  Evidently, assuming his narrative\nto be true, it was immediately after Mr. Mortimer Tregennis had left\nthe room.  That is a very important point.  The presumption is that it\nwas within a few minutes afterwards.  The cards still lay upon the\ntable. It was already past their usual hour for bed.  Yet they had not\nchanged their position or pushed back their chairs.  I repeat, then,\nthat the occurrence was immediately after his departure, and not later\nthan eleven o'clock last night.\n\n\"Our next obvious step is to check, so far as we can, the movements of\nMortimer Tregennis after he left the room.  In this there is no\ndifficulty, and they seem to be above suspicion. Knowing my methods as\nyou do, you were, of course, conscious of the somewhat clumsy water-pot\nexpedient by which I obtained a clearer impress of his foot than might\notherwise have been possible.  The wet, sandy path took it admirably.\nLast night was also wet, you will remember, and it was not\ndifficult--having obtained a sample print--to pick out his track among\nothers and to follow his movements.  He appears to have walked away\nswiftly in the direction of the vicarage.\n\n\"If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet some\noutside person affected the card-players, how can we reconstruct that\nperson, and how was such an impression of horror conveyed?  Mrs. Porter\nmay be eliminated.  She is evidently harmless.  Is there any evidence\nthat someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner produced\nso terrific an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their\nsenses?  The only suggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer\nTregennis himself, who says that his brother spoke about some movement\nin the garden.  That is certainly remarkable, as the night was rainy,\ncloudy, and dark.  Anyone who had the design to alarm these people\nwould be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he\ncould be seen.  There is a three-foot flower-border outside this\nwindow, but no indication of a footmark.  It is difficult to imagine,\nthen, how an outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon\nthe company, nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and\nelaborate an attempt.  You perceive our difficulties, Watson?\"\n\n\"They are only too clear,\" I answered with conviction.\n\n\"And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not\ninsurmountable,\" said Holmes.  \"I fancy that among your extensive\narchives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as obscure.\nMeanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are\navailable, and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of\nneolithic man.\"\n\nI may have commented upon my friend's power of mental detachment, but\nnever have I wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in\nCornwall when for two hours he discoursed upon celts, arrowheads, and\nshards, as lightly as if no sinister mystery were waiting for his\nsolution.  It was not until we had returned in the afternoon to our\ncottage that we found a visitor awaiting us, who soon brought our minds\nback to the matter in hand.  Neither of us needed to be told who that\nvisitor was.  The huge body, the craggy and deeply seamed face with the\nfierce eyes and hawk-like nose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed\nour cottage ceiling, the beard--golden at the fringes and white near\nthe lips, save for the nicotine stain from his perpetual cigar--all\nthese were as well known in London as in Africa, and could only be\nassociated with the tremendous personality of Dr. Leon Sterndale, the\ngreat lion-hunter and explorer.\n\nWe had heard of his presence in the district and had once or twice\ncaught sight of his tall figure upon the moorland paths. He made no\nadvances to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him,\nas it was well known that it was his love of seclusion which caused him\nto spend the greater part of the intervals between his journeys in a\nsmall bungalow buried in the lonely wood of Beauchamp Arriance.  Here,\namid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely lonely life,\nattending to his own simple wants and paying little apparent heed to\nthe affairs of his neighbours.  It was a surprise to me, therefore, to\nhear him asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any\nadvance in his reconstruction of this mysterious episode.  \"The county\npolice are utterly at fault,\" said he, \"but perhaps your wider\nexperience has suggested some conceivable explanation.  My only claim\nto being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences\nhere I have come to know this family of Tregennis very well--indeed,\nupon my Cornish mother's side I could call them cousins--and their\nstrange fate has naturally been a great shock to me.  I may tell you\nthat I had got as far as Plymouth upon my way to Africa, but the news\nreached me this morning, and I came straight back again to help in the\ninquiry.\"\n\nHolmes raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"Did you lose your boat through it?\"\n\n\"I will take the next.\"\n\n\"Dear me! that is friendship indeed.\"\n\n\"I tell you they were relatives.\"\n\n\"Quite so--cousins of your mother.  Was your baggage aboard the ship?\"\n\n\"Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.\"\n\n\"I see.  But surely this event could not have found its way into the\nPlymouth morning papers.\"\n\n\"No, sir; I had a telegram.\"\n\n\"Might I ask from whom?\"\n\nA shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer.\n\n\"You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\n\"It is my business.\"\n\nWith an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.\n\n\"I have no objection to telling you,\" he said.  \"It was Mr. Roundhay,\nthe vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Holmes.  \"I may say in answer to your original\nquestion that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of\nthis case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion.  It\nwould be premature to say more.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any\nparticular direction?\"\n\n\"No, I can hardly answer that.\"\n\n\"Then I have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit.\"  The famous\ndoctor strode out of our cottage in considerable ill-humour, and within\nfive minutes Holmes had followed him.  I saw him no more until the\nevening, when he returned with a slow step and haggard face which\nassured me that he had made no great progress with his investigation.\nHe glanced at a telegram which awaited him and threw it into the grate.\n\n\"From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,\" he said.  \"I learned the name of it\nfrom the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale's\naccount was true.  It appears that he did indeed spend last night\nthere, and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on to\nAfrica, while he returned to be present at this investigation.  What do\nyou make of that, Watson?\"\n\n\"He is deeply interested.\"\n\n\"Deeply interested--yes.  There is a thread here which we had not yet\ngrasped and which might lead us through the tangle.  Cheer up, Watson,\nfor I am very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand.\nWhen it does we may soon leave our difficulties behind us.\"\n\nLittle did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be realized, or\nhow strange and sinister would be that new development which opened up\nan entirely fresh line of investigation.  I was shaving at my window in\nthe morning when I heard the rattle of hoofs and, looking up, saw a\ndog-cart coming at a gallop down the road.  It pulled up at our door,\nand our friend, the vicar, sprang from it and rushed up our garden\npath. Holmes was already dressed, and we hastened down to meet him.\n\nOur visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but at last\nin gasps and bursts his tragic story came out of him.\n\n\"We are devil-ridden, Mr. Holmes!  My poor parish is devil-ridden!\" he\ncried.  \"Satan himself is loose in it!  We are given over into his\nhands!\"  He danced about in his agitation, a ludicrous object if it\nwere not for his ashy face and startled eyes.  Finally he shot out his\nterrible news.\n\n\"Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly the\nsame symptoms as the rest of his family.\"\n\nHolmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant.\n\n\"Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?\"\n\n\"Yes, I can.\"\n\n\"Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast.  Mr. Roundhay, we are\nentirely at your disposal.  Hurry--hurry, before things get\ndisarranged.\"\n\nThe lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an angle\nby themselves, the one above the other.  Below was a large\nsitting-room; above, his bedroom.  They looked out upon a croquet lawn\nwhich came up to the windows.  We had arrived before the doctor or the\npolice, so that everything was absolutely undisturbed.  Let me describe\nexactly the scene as we saw it upon that misty March morning.  It has\nleft an impression which can never be effaced from my mind.\n\nThe atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing stuffiness.\nThe servant who had first entered had thrown up the window, or it would\nhave been even more intolerable.  This might partly be due to the fact\nthat a lamp stood flaring and smoking on the centre table.  Beside it\nsat the dead man, leaning back in his chair, his thin beard projecting,\nhis spectacles pushed up on to his forehead, and his lean dark face\nturned towards the window and twisted into the same distortion of\nterror which had marked the features of his dead sister.  His limbs\nwere convulsed and his fingers contorted as though he had died in a\nvery paroxysm of fear.  He was fully clothed, though there were signs\nthat his dressing had been done in a hurry.  We had already learned\nthat his bed had been slept in, and that the tragic end had come to him\nin the early morning.\n\nOne realized the red-hot energy which underlay Holmes's phlegmatic\nexterior when one saw the sudden change which came over him from the\nmoment that he entered the fatal apartment.  In an instant he was tense\nand alert, his eyes shining, his face set, his limbs quivering with\neager activity.  He was out on the lawn, in through the window, round\nthe room, and up into the bedroom, for all the world like a dashing\nfoxhound drawing a cover.  In the bedroom he made a rapid cast around\nand ended by throwing open the window, which appeared to give him some\nfresh cause for excitement, for he leaned out of it with loud\nejaculations of interest and delight.  Then he rushed down the stair,\nout through the open window, threw himself upon his face on the lawn,\nsprang up and into the room once more, all with the energy of the\nhunter who is at the very heels of his quarry.  The lamp, which was an\nordinary standard, he examined with minute care, making certain\nmeasurements upon its bowl.  He carefully scrutinized with his lens the\ntalc shield which covered the top of the chimney and scraped off some\nashes which adhered to its upper surface, putting some of them into an\nenvelope, which he placed in his pocketbook.  Finally, just as the\ndoctor and the official police put in an appearance, he beckoned to the\nvicar and we all three went out upon the lawn.\n\n\"I am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely barren,\"\nhe remarked.  \"I cannot remain to discuss the matter with the police,\nbut I should be exceedingly obliged, Mr. Roundhay, if you would give\nthe inspector my compliments and direct his attention to the bedroom\nwindow and to the sitting-room lamp.  Each is suggestive, and together\nthey are almost conclusive.  If the police would desire further\ninformation I shall be happy to see any of them at the cottage.  And\nnow, Watson, I think that, perhaps, we shall be better employed\nelsewhere.\"\n\nIt may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur, or that\nthey imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of investigation;\nbut it is certain that we heard nothing from them for the next two\ndays.  During this time Holmes spent some of his time smoking and\ndreaming in the cottage; but a greater portion in country walks which\nhe undertook alone, returning after many hours without remark as to\nwhere he had been.  One experiment served to show me the line of his\ninvestigation.  He had bought a lamp which was the duplicate of the one\nwhich had burned in the room of Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of\nthe tragedy.  This he filled with the same oil as that used at the\nvicarage, and he carefully timed the period which it would take to be\nexhausted. Another experiment which he made was of a more unpleasant\nnature, and one which I am not likely ever to forget.\n\n\"You will remember, Watson,\" he remarked one afternoon, \"that there is\na single common point of resemblance in the varying reports which have\nreached us.  This concerns the effect of the atmosphere of the room in\neach case upon those who had first entered it.  You will recollect that\nMortimer Tregennis, in describing the episode of his last visit to his\nbrother's house, remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell\ninto a chair? You had forgotten?  Well I can answer for it that it was\nso. Now, you will remember also that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told\nus that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards\nopened the window.  In the second case--that of Mortimer Tregennis\nhimself--you cannot have forgotten the horrible stuffiness of the room\nwhen we arrived, though the servant had thrown open the window.  That\nservant, I found upon inquiry, was so ill that she had gone to her bed.\nYou will admit, Watson, that these facts are very suggestive.  In each\ncase there is evidence of a poisonous atmosphere.  In each case, also,\nthere is combustion going on in the room--in the one case a fire, in\nthe other a lamp.  The fire was needed, but the lamp was lit--as a\ncomparison of the oil consumed will show--long after it was broad\ndaylight.  Why?  Surely because there is some connection between three\nthings--the burning, the stuffy atmosphere, and, finally, the madness\nor death of those unfortunate people.  That is clear, is it not?\"\n\n\"It would appear so.\"\n\n\"At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis.  We will suppose,\nthen, that something was burned in each case which produced an\natmosphere causing strange toxic effects.  Very good. In the first\ninstance--that of the Tregennis family--this substance was placed in\nthe fire.  Now the window was shut, but the fire would naturally carry\nfumes to some extent up the chimney.  Hence one would expect the\neffects of the poison to be less than in the second case, where there\nwas less escape for the vapour.  The result seems to indicate that it\nwas so, since in the first case only the woman, who had presumably the\nmore sensitive organism, was killed, the others exhibiting that\ntemporary or permanent lunacy which is evidently the first effect of\nthe drug.  In the second case the result was complete.  The facts,\ntherefore, seem to bear out the theory of a poison which worked by\ncombustion.\n\n\"With this train of reasoning in my head I naturally looked about in\nMortimer Tregennis's room to find some remains of this substance.  The\nobvious place to look was the talc shelf or smoke-guard of the lamp.\nThere, sure enough, I perceived a number of flaky ashes, and round the\nedges a fringe of brownish powder, which had not yet been consumed.\nHalf of this I took, as you saw, and I placed it in an envelope.\"\n\n\"Why half, Holmes?\"\n\n\"It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the official\npolice force.  I leave them all the evidence which I found.  The poison\nstill remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it.  Now, Watson,\nwe will light our lamp; we will, however, take the precaution to open\nour window to avoid the premature decease of two deserving members of\nsociety, and you will seat yourself near that open window in an\narmchair unless, like a sensible man, you determine to have nothing to\ndo with the affair.  Oh, you will see it out, will you?  I thought I\nknew my Watson.  This chair I will place opposite yours, so that we may\nbe the same distance from the poison and face to face.  The door we\nwill leave ajar.  Each is now in a position to watch the other and to\nbring the experiment to an end should the symptoms seem alarming.  Is\nthat all clear?  Well, then, I take our powder--or what remains of\nit--from the envelope, and I lay it above the burning lamp.  So!  Now,\nWatson, let us sit down and await developments.\"\n\nThey were not long in coming.  I had hardly settled in my chair before\nI was conscious of a thick, musky odour, subtle and nauseous.  At the\nvery first whiff of it my brain and my imagination were beyond all\ncontrol.  A thick, black cloud swirled before my eyes, and my mind told\nme that in this cloud, unseen as yet, but about to spring out upon my\nappalled senses, lurked all that was vaguely horrible, all that was\nmonstrous and inconceivably wicked in the universe.  Vague shapes\nswirled and swam amid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace and a warning\nof something coming, the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the\nthreshold, whose very shadow would blast my soul.  A freezing horror\ntook possession of me.  I felt that my hair was rising, that my eyes\nwere protruding, that my mouth was opened, and my tongue like leather.\nThe turmoil within my brain was such that something must surely snap.\nI tried to scream and was vaguely aware of some hoarse croak which was\nmy own voice, but distant and detached from myself.  At the same moment,\nin some effort of escape, I broke through that cloud of despair and had\na glimpse of Holmes's face, white, rigid, and drawn with horror--the\nvery look which I had seen upon the features of the dead.  It was that\nvision which gave me an instant of sanity and of strength.  I dashed\nfrom my chair, threw my arms round Holmes, and together we lurched\nthrough the door, and an instant afterwards had thrown ourselves down\nupon the grass plot and were lying side by side, conscious only of the\nglorious sunshine which was bursting its way through the hellish cloud\nof terror which had girt us in. Slowly it rose from our souls like the\nmists from a landscape until peace and reason had returned, and we were\nsitting upon the grass, wiping our clammy foreheads, and looking with\napprehension at each other to mark the last traces of that terrific\nexperience which we had undergone.\n\n\"Upon my word, Watson!\" said Holmes at last with an unsteady voice, \"I\nowe you both my thanks and an apology.  It was an unjustifiable\nexperiment even for one's self, and doubly so for a friend.  I am\nreally very sorry.\"\n\n\"You know,\" I answered with some emotion, for I have never seen so much\nof Holmes's heart before, \"that it is my greatest joy and privilege to\nhelp you.\"\n\nHe relapsed at once into the half-humorous, half-cynical vein which was\nhis habitual attitude to those about him.  \"It would be superfluous to\ndrive us mad, my dear Watson,\" said he.  \"A candid observer would\ncertainly declare that we were so already before we embarked upon so\nwild an experiment.  I confess that I never imagined that the effect\ncould be so sudden and so severe.\"  He dashed into the cottage, and,\nreappearing with the burning lamp held at full arm's length, he threw\nit among a bank of brambles. \"We must give the room a little time to\nclear.  I take it, Watson, that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt\nas to how these tragedies were produced?\"\n\n\"None whatever.\"\n\n\"But the cause remains as obscure as before.  Come into the arbour here\nand let us discuss it together.  That villainous stuff seems still to\nlinger round my throat.  I think we must admit that all the evidence\npoints to this man, Mortimer Tregennis, having been the criminal in the\nfirst tragedy, though he was the victim in the second one.  We must\nremember, in the first place, that there is some story of a family\nquarrel, followed by a reconciliation.  How bitter that quarrel may\nhave been, or how hollow the reconciliation we cannot tell.   When I\nthink of Mortimer Tregennis, with the foxy face and the small shrewd,\nbeady eyes behind the spectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge\nto be of a particularly forgiving disposition. Well, in the next place,\nyou will remember that this idea of someone moving in the garden, which\ntook our attention for a moment from the real cause of the tragedy,\nemanated from him.  He had a motive in misleading us.  Finally, if he\ndid not throw the substance into the fire at the moment of leaving the\nroom, who did do so?  The affair happened immediately after his\ndeparture. Had anyone else come in, the family would certainly have\nrisen from the table.  Besides, in peaceful Cornwall, visitors did not\narrive after ten o'clock at night.  We may take it, then, that all the\nevidence points to Mortimer Tregennis as the culprit.\"\n\n\"Then his own death was suicide!\"\n\n\"Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible supposition.\nThe man who had the guilt upon his soul of having brought such a fate\nupon his own family might well be driven by remorse to inflict it upon\nhimself.  There are, however, some cogent reasons against it.\nFortunately, there is one man in England who knows all about it, and I\nhave made arrangements by which we shall hear the facts this afternoon\nfrom his own lips. Ah! he is a little before his time.  Perhaps you\nwould kindly step this way, Dr. Leon Sterndale. We have been conducing\na chemical experiment indoors which has left our little room hardly fit\nfor the reception of so distinguished a visitor.\"\n\nI had heard the click of the garden gate, and now the majestic figure\nof the great African explorer appeared upon the path.  He turned in\nsome surprise towards the rustic arbour in which we sat.\n\n\"You sent for me, Mr. Holmes.  I had your note about an hour ago, and I\nhave come, though I really do not know why I should obey your summons.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate,\" said Holmes.\n\"Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence.\nYou will excuse this informal reception in the open air, but my friend\nWatson and I have nearly furnished an additional chapter to what the\npapers call the Cornish Horror, and we prefer a clear atmosphere for\nthe present.  Perhaps, since the matters which we have to discuss will\naffect you personally in a very intimate fashion, it is as well that we\nshould talk where there can be no eavesdropping.\"\n\nThe explorer took his cigar from his lips and gazed sternly at my\ncompanion.\n\n\"I am at a loss to know, sir,\" he said, \"what you can have to speak\nabout which affects me personally in a very intimate fashion.\"\n\n\"The killing of Mortimer Tregennis,\" said Holmes.\n\nFor a moment I wished that I were armed.  Sterndale's fierce face\nturned to a dusky red, his eyes glared, and the knotted, passionate\nveins started out in his forehead, while he sprang forward with\nclenched hands towards my companion.  Then he stopped, and with a\nviolent effort he resumed a cold, rigid calmness, which was, perhaps,\nmore suggestive of danger than his hot-headed outburst.\n\n\"I have lived so long among savages and beyond the law,\" said he, \"that\nI have got into the way of being a law to myself.  You would do well,\nMr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to do you an injury.\"\n\n\"Nor have I any desire to do you an injury, Dr. Sterndale. Surely the\nclearest proof of it is that, knowing what I know, I have sent for you\nand not for the police.\"\n\nSterndale sat down with a gasp, overawed for, perhaps, the first time\nin his adventurous life.  There was a calm assurance of power in\nHolmes's manner which could not be withstood.  Our visitor stammered\nfor a moment, his great hands opening and shutting in his agitation.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked at last.  \"If this is bluff upon your\npart, Mr. Holmes, you have chosen a bad man for your experiment. Let us\nhave no more beating about the bush.  What DO you mean?\"\n\n\"I will tell you,\" said Holmes, \"and the reason why I tell you is that\nI hope frankness may beget frankness.  What my next step may be will\ndepend entirely upon the nature of your own defence.\"\n\n\"My defence?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"My defence against what?\"\n\n\"Against the charge of killing Mortimer Tregennis.\"\n\nSterndale mopped his forehead with his handkerchief.  \"Upon my word,\nyou are getting on,\" said he.  \"Do all your successes depend upon this\nprodigious power of bluff?\"\n\n\"The bluff,\" said Holmes sternly, \"is upon your side, Dr. Leon\nSterndale, and not upon mine.  As a proof I will tell you some of the\nfacts upon which my conclusions are based.  Of your return from\nPlymouth, allowing much of your property to go on to Africa, I will say\nnothing save that it first informed me that you were one of the factors\nwhich had to be taken into account in reconstructing this drama--\"\n\n\"I came back--\"\n\n\"I have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and\ninadequate.  We will pass that.  You came down here to ask me whom I\nsuspected.  I refused to answer you. You then went to the vicarage,\nwaited outside it for some time, and finally returned to your cottage.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"I followed you.\"\n\n\"I saw no one.\"\n\n\"That is what you may expect to see when I follow you.  You spent a\nrestless night at your cottage, and you formed certain plans, which in\nthe early morning you proceeded to put into execution. Leaving your\ndoor just as day was breaking, you filled your pocket with some reddish\ngravel that was lying heaped beside your gate.\"\n\nSterndale gave a violent start and looked at Holmes in amazement.\n\n\"You then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from the\nvicarage.  You were wearing, I may remark, the same pair of ribbed\ntennis shoes which are at the present moment upon your feet.  At the\nvicarage you passed through the orchard and the side hedge, coming out\nunder the window of the lodger Tregennis. It was now daylight, but the\nhousehold was not yet stirring.  You drew some of the gravel from your\npocket, and you threw it up at the window above you.\"\n\nSterndale sprang to his feet.\n\n\"I believe that you are the devil himself!\" he cried.\n\nHolmes smiled at the compliment.  \"It took two, or possibly three,\nhandfuls before the lodger came to the window.  You beckoned him to\ncome down.  He dressed hurriedly and descended to his sitting-room.\nYou entered by the window.  There was an interview--a short one--during\nwhich you walked up and down the room.  Then you passed out and closed\nthe window, standing on the lawn outside smoking a cigar and watching\nwhat occurred. Finally, after the death of Tregennis, you withdrew as\nyou had come.  Now, Dr. Sterndale, how do you justify such conduct, and\nwhat were the motives for your actions?  If you prevaricate or trifle\nwith me, I give you my assurance that the matter will pass out of my\nhands forever.\"\n\nOur visitor's face had turned ashen gray as he listened to the words of\nhis accuser.  Now he sat for some time in thought with his face sunk in\nhis hands.  Then with a sudden impulsive gesture he plucked a\nphotograph from his breast-pocket and threw it on the rustic table\nbefore us.\n\n\"That is why I have done it,\" said he.\n\nIt showed the bust and face of a very beautiful woman.  Holmes stooped\nover it.\n\n\"Brenda Tregennis,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, Brenda Tregennis,\" repeated our visitor.  \"For years I have loved\nher.  For years she has loved me.  There is the secret of that Cornish\nseclusion which people have marvelled at.  It has brought me close to\nthe one thing on earth that was dear to me. I could not marry her, for\nI have a wife who has left me for years and yet whom, by the deplorable\nlaws of England, I could not divorce.  For years Brenda waited.  For\nyears I waited.  And this is what we have waited for.\"  A terrible sob\nshook his great frame, and he clutched his throat under his brindled\nbeard.  Then with an effort he mastered himself and spoke on:\n\n\"The vicar knew.  He was in our confidence.  He would tell you that she\nwas an angel upon earth.  That was why he telegraphed to me and I\nreturned.  What was my baggage or Africa to me when I learned that such\na fate had come upon my darling?  There you have the missing clue to my\naction, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\n\"Proceed,\" said my friend.\n\nDr. Sterndale drew from his pocket a paper packet and laid it upon the\ntable.  On the outside was written \"Radix pedis diaboli\" with a red\npoison label beneath it.  He pushed it towards me.  \"I understand that\nyou are a doctor, sir.  Have you ever heard of this preparation?\"\n\n\"Devil's-foot root!  No, I have never heard of it.\"\n\n\"It is no reflection upon your professional knowledge,\" said he, \"for I\nbelieve that, save for one sample in a laboratory at Buda, there is no\nother specimen in Europe.  It has not yet found its way either into the\npharmacopoeia or into the literature of toxicology.  The root is shaped\nlike a foot, half human, half goatlike; hence the fanciful name given\nby a botanical missionary.  It is used as an ordeal poison by the\nmedicine-men in certain districts of West Africa and is kept as a\nsecret among them.  This particular specimen I obtained under very\nextraordinary circumstances in the Ubangi country.\"  He opened the\npaper as he spoke and disclosed a heap of reddish-brown, snuff-like\npowder.\n\n\"Well, sir?\" asked Holmes sternly.\n\n\"I am about to tell you, Mr. Holmes, all that actually occurred, for\nyou already know so much that it is clearly to my interest that you\nshould know all.  I have already explained the relationship in which I\nstood to the Tregennis family. For the sake of the sister I was\nfriendly with the brothers.  There was a family quarrel about money\nwhich estranged this man Mortimer, but it was supposed to be made up,\nand I afterwards met him as I did the others.  He was a sly, subtle,\nscheming man, and several things arose which gave me a suspicion of\nhim, but I had no cause for any positive quarrel.\n\n\"One day, only a couple of weeks ago, he came down to my cottage and I\nshowed him some of my African curiosities.  Among other things I\nexhibited this powder, and I told him of its strange properties, how it\nstimulates those brain centres which control the emotion of fear, and\nhow either madness or death is the fate of the unhappy native who is\nsubjected to the ordeal by the priest of his tribe.  I told him also\nhow powerless European science would be to detect it.  How he took it I\ncannot say, for I never left the room, but there is no doubt that it\nwas then, while I was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes, that he\nmanaged to abstract some of the devil's-foot root.  I well remember how\nhe plied me with questions as to the amount and the time that was\nneeded for its effect, but I little dreamed that he could have a\npersonal reason for asking.\n\n\"I thought no more of the matter until the vicar's telegram reached me\nat Plymouth.  This villain had thought that I would be at sea before\nthe news could reach me, and that I should be lost for years in Africa.\nBut I returned at once.  Of course, I could not listen to the details\nwithout feeling assured that my poison had been used.  I came round to\nsee you on the chance that some other explanation had suggested itself\nto you.  But there could be none.  I was convinced that Mortimer\nTregennis was the murderer; that for the sake of money, and with the\nidea, perhaps, that if the other members of his family were all insane\nhe would be the sole guardian of their joint property, he had used the\ndevil's-foot powder upon them, driven two of them out of their senses,\nand killed his sister Brenda, the one human being whom I have ever\nloved or who has ever loved me.  There was his crime; what was to be\nhis punishment?\n\n\"Should I appeal to the law?  Where were my proofs?  I knew that the\nfacts were true, but could I help to make a jury of countrymen believe\nso fantastic a story?  I might or I might not. But I could not afford\nto fail.  My soul cried out for revenge. I have said to you once\nbefore, Mr. Holmes, that I have spent much of my life outside the law,\nand that I have come at last to be a law to myself.  So it was even\nnow.  I determined that the fate which he had given to others should be\nshared by himself. Either that or I would do justice upon him with my\nown hand.  In all England there can be no man who sets less value upon\nhis own life than I do at the present moment.\n\n\"Now I have told you all.  You have yourself supplied the rest. I did,\nas you say, after a restless night, set off early from my cottage.  I\nforesaw the difficulty of arousing him, so I gathered some gravel from\nthe pile which you have mentioned, and I used it to throw up to his\nwindow.  He came down and admitted me through the window of the\nsitting-room.  I laid his offence before him. I told him that I had\ncome both as judge and executioner.  The wretch sank into a chair,\nparalyzed at the sight of my revolver. I lit the lamp, put the powder\nabove it, and stood outside the window, ready to carry out my threat to\nshoot him should he try to leave the room.  In five minutes he died.\nMy God! how he died!  But my heart was flint, for he endured nothing\nwhich my innocent darling had not felt before him.  There is my story,\nMr. Holmes.  Perhaps, if you loved a woman, you would have done as much\nyourself.  At any rate, I am in your hands.  You can take what steps\nyou like.  As I have already said, there is no man living who can fear\ndeath less than I do.\"\n\nHolmes sat for some little time in silence.\n\n\"What were your plans?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"I had intended to bury myself in central Africa.  My work there is but\nhalf finished.\"\n\n\"Go and do the other half,\" said Holmes.  \"I, at least, am not prepared\nto prevent you.\"\n\nDr. Sterndale raised his giant figure, bowed gravely, and walked from\nthe arbour.  Holmes lit his pipe and handed me his pouch.\n\n\"Some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change,\" said\nhe.  \"I think you must agree, Watson, that it is not a case in which we\nare called upon to interfere.  Our investigation has been independent,\nand our action shall be so also.  You would not denounce the man?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" I answered.\n\n\"I have never loved, Watson, but if I did and if the woman I loved had\nmet such an end, I might act even as our lawless lion-hunter has done.\nWho knows?  Well, Watson, I will not offend your intelligence by\nexplaining what is obvious.  The gravel upon the window-sill was, of\ncourse, the starting-point of my research.  It was unlike anything in\nthe vicarage garden.  Only when my attention had been drawn to Dr.\nSterndale and his cottage did I find its counterpart.  The lamp shining\nin broad daylight and the remains of powder upon the shield were\nsuccessive links in a fairly obvious chain.  And now, my dear Watson, I\nthink we may dismiss the matter from our mind and go back with a clear\nconscience to the study of those Chaldean roots which are surely to be\ntraced in the Cornish branch of the great Celtic speech.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventure of the Devil's Foot, by \nArthur Conan Doyle",
    "The Seventh Seal\n<b> \n</b>The night had brought little relief from the heat, and at dawn a hot gust of\nwind blows across the colorless sea. The KNIGHT, Antonius Block, lies\nprostrate on some spruce branches spread over the fine sand. His eyes are \nwide-open and bloodshot from lack of sleep. \n\nNearby his squire JONS is snoring loudly. He has fallen asleep where he \ncollapsed, at the edge of the forest among the wind-gnarled fir trees. His \nopen mouth gapes towards the dawn, and unearthly sounds come from his throat.\nAt the sudden gust of wind, the horses stir, stretching their parched muzzles \ntowards the sea. They are as thin and worn as their masters.\n\nThe KNIGHT has risen and waded into the shallow water, where he rinses his \nsunburned face and blistered lips. JONS rolls over to face the forest and the \ndarkness. He moans in his sleep and vigorously scratches the stubbled hair on \nhis head. A scar stretches diagonally across his scalp, as white as lightning \nagainst the grime. \n\nThe KNIGHT returns to the beach and falls on his knees. With his eyes closed \nand brow furrowed, he says his morning prayers. His hands are clenched \ntogether and his lips form the words silently. His face is sad and bitter. He \nopens his eyes and stares directly into the morning sun which wallows up from \nthe misty sea like some bloated, dying fish. The sky is gray and immobile, a \ndome of lead. A cloud hangs mute and dark over the western horizon. High up, \nbarely visible, a seagull floats on motionless wings. Its cry is weird and \nrestless. The KNIGHT'S large gray horse lifts its head and whinnies. Antonius \nBlock turns around.\n\nBehind him stands a man in black. His face is very pale and he keeps his \nhands hidden in the wide folds of his cloak. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWho are you? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI am Death.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHave you come for me?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI have been walking by your side for a long \n\t\ttime. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThat I know. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tAre you prepared?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT\n</b>\t\tMy body is frightened, but I am not. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWell, there is no shame in that.\n\nThe KNIGHT has risen to his feet. He shivers. DEATH opens his cloak to place \nit around the KNIGHT'S shoulders. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWait a moment.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tThat's what they all say. I grant no reprieves. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou play chess, don't you?\n\nA gleam of interest kindles in DEATH'S eyes. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tHow did you know that?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI have seen it in paintings and heard it sung \n\t\tin ballads.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYes, in fact I'm quite a good chess player. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tBut you can't be better than I am.\n\nThe KNIGHT rummages in the big black bag which he keeps beside him and takes \nout a small chessboard. He places it carefully on the ground and begins \nsetting up the pieces.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhy do you want to play chess with me? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI have my reasons. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tThat is your privilege.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThe condition is that I may live as long as I \n\t\thold out against you. If I win, you will \n\t\trelease me. Is it agreed? \n\nThe KNIGHT holds out his two fists to DEATH, who smiles at him suddenly. \nDEATH points to one of the KNIGHT'S hands; it contains a black pawn. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou drew black!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tVery appropriate. Don't you think so?\n\nThe KNIGHT and DEATH bend over the chessboard. After a moment of hesitation, \nAntonius Block opens with his king's pawn. DEATH moves, also using his king's \npawn.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe morning breeze has died down. The restless movement of the sea has \nceased, the water is silent. The sun rises from the haze and its glow \nwhitens. The sea gull floats under the dark cloud, frozen in space. The day \nis already scorchingly hot.\n\nThe squire JONS is awakened by a kick in the rear. Opening his eyes, he \ngrunts like a pig and yawns broadly. He scrambles to his feet, saddles his \nhorse and picks up the heavy pack.\n\nThe KNIGHT slowly rides away from the sea, into the forest near the beach and \nup towards the road. He pretends not to hear the morning prayers of his \nsquire. JONS soon overtakes him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(sings)\n\t \tBetween a strumpet's legs to lie \n\t\tIs the life for which I sigh.\n\nHe stops and looks at his master, but the KNIGHT hasn't heard JON'S song, or \nhe pretends that he hasn't. To give further vent to his irritation, JONS \nsings even louder. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(sings)\n\t\tUp above is God Almighty \n\t\tSo very far away, \n\t\tBut your brother the Devil \n\t\tYou will meet on every level.\n\nJONS finally gets the KNIGHT'S attention. He stops singing. The KNIGHT, his \nhorse, JONS'S own horse and JONS himself know all the songs by heart. The \nlong, dusty journey from the Holy Land hasn't made them any cleaner. They \nride across a mossy heath which stretches towards the horizon. Beyond it, the \nsea lies shimmering in the white glitter of the sun.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tIn Frjestad everyone was talking about evil \n\t\tomens and other horrible things. Two horses had \n\t\teaten each other in the night, and, in the \n\t\tchurchyard, graves had been opened and the \n\t\tremains of corpses scattered all over the \n\t\tplace. Yesterday afternoon there were as many \n\t\tas four suns in the heavens.\n<b> \n</b>The KNIGHT doesn't answer. Close by, a scrawny dog is whining, crawling \ntowards its master, who is sleeping in a sitting position in the blazing hot \nsun. A black cloud of flies clusters around his head and shoulders. The \nmiserable-looking dog whines incessantly as it lies flat on its stomach, \nwagging its tail.\n\nJONS dismounts and approaches the sleeping man. JONS addresses him politely. \nWhen he doesn't receive an answer, he walks up to the man in order to shake \nhim awake. He bends over the sleeping man's shoulder, but quickly pulls back \nhis hand. The man falls backward on the heath, his face turned towards JONS. \nIt is a corpse, staring at JONS with empty eye sockets and white teeth. \n\nJONS remounts and overtakes his master. He takes a drink from his waterskin \nand hands the bag to the knight. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWell, did he show you the way? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNot exactly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhat did he say? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNothing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWas he a mute?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNo, sir, I wouldn't say that. As a matter of \n\t\tfact, he was quite eloquent. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tOh?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tHe was eloquent, all right. The trouble is that \n\t\twhat he had to say was most depressing.\n\t\t\t(sings)\n\t\tOne moment you're bright and lively, \n\t\tThe next you're crawling with worms. \n\t\tFate is a terrible villain \n\t\tAnd you, my friend, its poor victim. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tMust you sing? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNo.\n\nThe KNIGHT hands his squire a piece of bread, which keeps him quiet for a \nwhile. The sun burns down on them cruelly, and beads of perspiration trickle \ndown their faces. There is a cloud of dust around the horses' hooves. They \nride past an inlet and along verdant groves. In the shade of some large trees \nstands a bulging wagon covered with a mottled canvas. A horse whinnies nearby \nand is answered by the KNIGHT'S horse. The two travelers do not stop to rest \nunder the shade of the trees but continue riding until they disappear at the \nbend of the road.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nIn his sleep, JOF the juggler hears the neighing of his horse and the answer \nfrom a distance. He tries to go on sleeping, but it is stifling inside the \nwagon. The rays of the sun filtering through the canvas cast streaks of light \nacross the face of JOF'S wife, MIA, and their one-year-old son, MIKAEL, who \nare sleeping deeply and peacefully. Near them, JONAS SKAT, an older man, \nsnores loudly. \n\nJOF crawls out of the wagon. There is still a spot of shade under the big \ntrees. He takes a drink of water, gargles, stretches and talks to his scrawny \nold horse. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tGood morning. Have you had breakfast? I can't \n\t\teat grass, worse luck. Can't you teach me how? \n\t\tWe're a little hard up. People aren't very \n\t\tinterested in juggling in this part of the \n\t\tcountry.\n\nHe has picked up the juggling balls and slowly begins to toss them. Then he \nstands on his head and cackles like a hen. Suddenly he stops and sits down \nwith a look of utter astonishment on his face. The wind causes the trees to \nsway slightly. The leaves stir and there is a soft murmur. The flowers and \nthe grass bend gracefully, and somewhere a bird raises its voice in a long \nwarble.\n\nJOF'S face breaks into a smile and his eyes fill with tears. With a dazed \nexpression he sits flat on his behind while the grass rustles softly, and \nbees and butterflies hum around his head. The unseen bird continues to sing.\n\nSuddenly the breeze stops blowing, the bird stops singing, JOF'S smile fades, \nthe flowers and grass wilt in the heat. The old horse is still walking around \ngrazing and swishing its tail to ward off the flies. \n\nJOF comes to life. He rushes into the wagon and shakes MIA awake.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tMia, wake up. Wake up! Mia, I've just seen \n\t\tsomething. I've got to tell you about it!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(sits up, terrified)\n\t\tWhat is it? What's happened? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tListen, I've had a vision. No, it wasn't a \n\t\tvision. It was real, absolutely real.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tOh, so you've had a vision again!\n\nMIA's voice is filled with gentle irony. JOF shakes his head and grabs her by \nthe shoulders. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tBut I did see her! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhom did you see? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThe Virgin Mary.\n\nMIA can't help being impressed by her husband's fervor. She lowers her voice.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDid you really see her?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tShe was so close to me that I could have \n\t\ttouched her. She had a golden crown on her head \n\t\tand wore a blue gown with flowers of gold. She \n\t\twas barefoot and had small brown hands with \n\t\twhich she was holding the Child and teaching \n\t\tHim to walk. And then she saw me watching her \n\t\tand she smiled at me. My eyes filled with tears \n\t\tand when I wiped them away, she had disappeared. \n\t\tAnd everything became so still in the sky and \n\t\ton the earth. Can you understand ... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhat an imagination you have.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tYou don't believe me! But it was real, I tell \n\t\tyou, not the kind of reality you see every day, \n\t\tbut a different kind. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tPerhaps it was the kind of reality you told us \n\t\tabout when you saw the Devil painting our wagon \n\t\twheels red, using his tail as a brush.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(embarrassed)\n\t\tWhy must you keep bringing that up? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tAnd then you discovered that you had red paint \n\t\tunder your nails.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWell, perhaps that time I made it up. \n\t\t\t(eagerly)  \n\t\tI did it just so that you would believe in my \n\t\tother visions. The real ones. The ones that I \n\t\tdidn't make up. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(severely)\n\t\tYou have to keep your visions under control.\n\t\tOtherwise people will think that you're a \n\t\thalf-wit, which you're not. At least not yet -- \n\t\tas far as I know. But, come to think of it, I'm \n\t\tnot so sure about that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(angry)\n\t\tI didn't ask to have visions. I can't help it \n\t\tif voices speak to me, if the Holy Virgin \n\t\tappears before me and angels and devils like my \n\t\tcompany.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\t\t(sits up)\n\t\tHaven't I told you once and for all that I need \n\t\tmy morning's sleep! I have asked you politely, \n\t\tpleaded with you, but nothing works. So now I'm \n\t\ttelling you to shut up!\n\nHis eyes are popping with rage. He turns over and continues snoring where he \nleft off. MIA and JOF decide that it would be wisest to leave the wagon. They \nsit down on a crate. MIA has MIKAEL on her knees. He is naked and squirms \nvigorously. JOF sits close to his wife. Slumped over, he still looks dazed \nand astonished. A dry, hot wind blows from the sea.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tIf we would only get some rain. Everything is \n\t\tburned to cinders. We won't have anything to \n\t\teat this winter. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(yawning)\n\t\tWe'll get by.\n\nHe says this smilingly, with a casual air. He stretches and laughs \ncontentedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI want Mikael to have a better life than ours. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tMikael will grow up to be a great acrobat -- or \n\t\ta juggler who can do the one impossible trick. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhat's that?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tTo make one of the balls stand absolutely still\n\t\tin the air. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tBut that's impossible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tImpossible for us -- but not for him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYou're dreaming again.\n\nShe yawns. The sun, has made her a bit drowsy and she lies down on the grass.\nJOF does likewise and puts one arm around his wife's shoulders.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI've composed a song. I made it up during the \n\t\tnight when I couldn't sleep. Do you want to \n\t\thear it? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tSing it. I'm very curious.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI have to sit up first.\n\nHe sits with his legs crossed, makes a dramatic gesture with his arms and \nsings in a loud voice. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(sings)\n\t\tOn a lily branch a dove is perched \n\t\tAgainst the summer sky, \n\t\tShe sings a wondrous song of Christ \n\t\tAnd there's great joy on high.\n\nHe interrupts his singing in order to be complimented by his wife.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tMia! Are you asleep? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tIt's a lovely song. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI haven't finished yet.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI heard it, but I think I'll sleep a little \n\t\tlonger. You can sing the rest to me afterwards. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAll you do is sleep.\n\nJOF is a bit offended and glances over at his son, MIKAEL, but he is also \nsleeping soundly in the high grass. JONAS SKAT comes out from the wagon. He \nyawns; he is very tired and in a bad humor. In his hands he holds a crudely \nmade death mask.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tIs this supposed to be a mask for an actor? If \n\t\tthe priests didn't pay us so well, I'd say no \n\t\tthank you. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAre you going to play Death?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tJust think, scaring decent folk out of their \n\t\twits with this kind of nonsense.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWhen are we supposed to do this play?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tAt the saints' feast in Elsinore. We're going \n\t\tto perform right on the church steps, believe \n\t\tit or not.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWouldn't it be better to play something bawdy? \n\t\tPeople like it better, and, besides, it's more \n\t\tfun.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tIdiot. There's a rumor going around that \n\t\tthere's a terrible pestilence in the land, and \n\t\tnow the priests are prophesying sudden death \n\t\tand all sorts of spiritual agonies. \n\nMIA is awake now and lies contentedly on her back, sucking on a blade of \ngrass and looking smilingly at her husband.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAnd what part am I to play?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tYou're such a damn fool, so you're going to be \n\t\tthe Soul of Man.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThat's a bad part, of course.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tWho makes the decisions around here? Who is the\n\t\tdirector of this company anyhow?\n\nSKAT, grinning, holds the mask in front of his face and recites dramatically.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tBear this in mind, you fool. Your life hangs by \n\t\ta thread. Your time is short. \n\t\t\t(in his usual voice) \n\t\tAre the women going to like me in this getup? \n\t\tWill I make a hit? No! I feel as if I were dead \n\t\talready.\n\nHe stumbles into the wagon muttering furiously. JOF sits, leaning forward. \nMIA lies beside him on the grass. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tJof!\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWhat is it?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tSit still. Don't move. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWhat do you mean? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDon't say anything. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI'm as silent as a grave. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tShh! I love you.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nWaves of heat envelop the gray stone church in a strange white mist. The \nKNIGHT dismounts and enters. After tying up the horses, JONS slowly follows \nhim in. When he comes onto the church porch he stops in surprise. To the \nright of the entrance there is a large fresco on the wall, not quite \nfinished. Perched on a crude scaffolding is a PAINTER wearing a red cap and \npaint-stained clothes. He has one brush in his mouth, while with another in \nhis hand he outlines a small, terrified human face amidst a sea of other \nfaces.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhat is this supposed to represent? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThe Dance of Death. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAnd that one is Death?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tYes, he dances off with all of them.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhy do you paint such nonsense?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tI thought it would serve to remind people that \n\t\tthey must die.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWell, it's not going to make them feel any \n\t\thappier. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tWhy should one always make people happy? It \n\t\tmight not be a bad idea to scare them a little \n\t\tonce in a while.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThen they'll close their eyes and refuse to \n\t\tlook at your painting.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tOh, they'll look. A skull is almost more \n\t\tinteresting than a naked woman.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tIf you do scare them ... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThey'll think. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAnd if they think ...\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThey'll become still more scared.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAnd then they'll run right into the arms of the \n\t\tpriests. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThat's not my business.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou're only painting your Dance of Death. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tI'm only painting things as they are. Everyone \n\t\telse can do as he likes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tJust think how some people will curse you. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tMaybe. But then I'll paint something amusing \n\t\tfor them to look at. I have to make a living \n\t\t-- at least until the plague takes me.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThe plague. That sounds horrible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tYou should see the boils on a diseased man's \n\t\tthroat. You should see how his body shrivels up \n\t\tso that his legs look like knotted strings -- \n\t\tlike the man I've painted over there.\n\nThe PAINTER points with his brush. JONS sees a small human form writhing in \nthe grass, its eyes turned upwards in a frenzied look of horror and pain. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThat looks terrible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tIt certainly does. He tries to rip out the \n\t\tboil, he bites his hands, tears his veins open \n\t\twith his fingernails and his screams can be \n\t\theard everywhere. Does that scare you?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tScare? Me? You don't know me. What are the \n\t\thorrors you've painted over there?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThe remarkable thing is that the poor creatures\n\t\tthink the pestilence is the Lord's punishment. \n\t\tMobs of people who call themselves Slaves of \n\t\tSin are swarming over the country, flagellating \n\t\tthemselves and others, all for the glory of God.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDo they really whip themselves?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tYes, it's a terrible sight. I crawl into a \n\t\tditch and hide when they pass by.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDo you have any brandy? I've been drinking \n\t\twater all day and it's made me as thirsty as a \n\t\tcamel in the desert. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tI think I frightened you after all.\n\nJONS sits down with the PAINTER, who produces a jug of brandy.\n\n\n\nThe KNIGHT is kneeling before a small altar. It is dark and quiet around him.\nThe air is cool and musty. Pictures of saints look down on him with stony \neyes. Christ's face is turned upwards, His mouth open as if in a cry of \nanguish. On the ceiling beam there is a representation of a hideous devil \nspying on a miserable human being. The KNIGHT hears a sound from the \nconfession booth and approaches it. The face of DEATH appears behind the \ngrille for an instant, but the KNIGHT doesn't see him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI want to talk to you as openly as I can, but \n\t\tmy heart is empty.\n\nDEATH doesn't answer.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThe emptiness is a mirror turned towards my \n\t\town face. I see myself in it, and I am filled \n\t\twith fear and disgust. \n\nDEATH doesn't answer.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThrough my indifference to my fellow men, I \n\t\thave isolated myself from their company. Now I \n\t\tlive in a world of phantoms. I am imprisoned in \n\t\tmy dreams and fantasies. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tAnd yet you don't want to die. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYes, I do.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhat are you waiting for? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI want knowledge. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYou want guarantees?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tCall it whatever you like. Is it so cruelly \n\t\tinconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why \n\t\tshould He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken \n\t\tpromises and unseen miracles? \n\nDEATH doesn't answer.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHow can we have faith in those who believe when \n\t\twe can't have faith in ourselves? What is going \n\t\tto happen to those of us who want to believe \n\t\tbut aren't able to? And what is to become of \n\t\tthose who neither want to nor are capable of \n\t\tbelieving?\n\nThe KNIGHT stops and waits for a reply, but no one speaks or answers him. \nThere is complete silence. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhy can't I kill God within me? Why does He \n\t\tlive on in this painful and humiliating way \n\t\teven though I curse Him and want to tear Him \n\t\tout of my heart? Why, in spite of everything, \n\t\tis He a baffling reality that I can't shake \n\t\toff? Do you hear me? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYes, I hear you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI want knowledge, not faith, not suppositions, \n\t\tbut knowledge. I want God to stretch out His \n\t\thand towards me, reveal Himself and speak to \n\t\tme. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tBut He remains silent.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT\n</b>\t\tI call out to Him in the dark but no one seems \n\t\tto be there.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tPerhaps no one is there.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThen life is an outrageous horror. No one can \n\t\tlive in the face of death, knowing that all is \n\t\tnothingness. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tMost people never reflect about either death or \n\t\tthe futility of life.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tBut one day they will have to stand at that \n\t\tlast moment of life and look towards the \n\t\tdarkness. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhen that day comes ...\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tIn our fear, we make an image, and that image \n\t\twe call God.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYou are worrying ...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tDeath visited me this morning.

But I \n\t\twill use my reprieve for one meaningful deed. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tIs that why you are playing chess with Death? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHe is a clever opponent, but up to now I \n\t\thaven't lost a single man.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tHow will you outwit Death in your game? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI use a combination of the bishop and the \n\t\tknight which he hasn't yet discovered. In the \n\t\tnext move I'll shatter one of his flanks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI'll remember that.\n\nDEATH shows his face at the grill of the confession booth for a moment but \ndisappears instantly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou've tricked and cheated me! But we'll meet \n\t\tagain, and I'll find a way.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\t\t(invisible)\n\t\tWe'll meet at the inn, and there we'll continue \n\t\tplaying.\n\nThe KNIGHT raises his hand and looks at it in the sunlight which comes \nthrough the tiny window. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThis is my hand. I can move it, feel the blood \n\t\tpulsing through it. The sun is still high in \n\t\tthe sky and I, Antonius Block, am playing \n\t\tchess with Death. \n\nHe makes a fist of his hand and lifts it to his temple.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, JONS and the PAINTER have got drunk and are talking animatedly \ntogether.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tMe and my master have been abroad and have just \n\t\tcome home. Do you understand, you little \n\t\tpictor? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThe Crusade.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(drunk)\n\t\tPrecisely. For ten years we sat in the Holy \n\t\tLand and let snakes bite us, flies sting us, \n\t\twild animals eat us, heathens butcher us, the \n\t\twine poison us, the women give us lice, the \n\t\tlice devour us, the fevers rot us, all for the \n\t\tGlory of God. Our crusade was such madness that \n\t\tonly a real idealist could have thought it up. \n\t\tBut what you said about the plague was \n\t\thorrible. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tIt's worse than that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAh, me. No matter which way you turn, you have \n\t\tyour rump behind you. That's the truth.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThe rump behind you, the rump behind you \n\t\tthere's a profound truth.\n\nJONS paints a small figure which is supposed to represent himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThis is squire Jns. He grins at Death, mocks \n\t\tthe Lord, laughs at himself and leers at the \n\t\tgirls. His world is a Jnsworld, believable \n\t\tonly to himself, ridiculous to all including \n\t\thimself, meaningless to Heaven and of no \n\t\tinterest to Hell. \n\nThe KNIGHT walks by, calls to his squire and goes out into the bright \nsunshine. JONS manages to set himself down from the scaffolding.\n\nOutside the church, four soldiers and a monk are in the process of putting a \nwoman in the stocks. Her face is pale and child-like, her head has been \nshaved, and her knuckles are bloody and broken. Her eyes are wide open, yet \nshe doesn't appear to be fully conscious. \n\nJONS and the KNIGHT stop and watch in silence. The soldiers are working \nquickly and skillfully, but they seem frightened and dejected. The monk \nmumbles from a small book. One of the soldiers picks up a wooden bucket and \nwith his hand begins to smear a bloody paste on the wall of the church and \naround the woman. JONS holds his nose.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThat soup of yours has a hell of a stink. What \n\t\tis it good for?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER \n</b>\t\tShe has had carnal intercourse with the Evil \n\t\tOne. \n\nHe whispers this with a horrified face and continues to splash the sticky \nmess on the wall. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAnd now she's in the stocks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER \n</b>\t\tShe will be burned tomorrow morning at the \n\t\tparish boundary. But we have to keep the Devil \n\t\taway from the rest of us.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(holding his nose)\n\t\tAnd you do that with this stinking mess?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER \n</b>\t\tIt's the best remedy: blood mixed with the bile \n\t\tof a big black dog. The Devil can't stand the \n\t\tsmell. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNeither can I.\n<b> \n</b>JONS walks over towards the horses. The KNIGHT stands for a few, moments \nlooking at the young girl. She is almost a child. Slowly she turns her eyes \ntowards him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHave you seen the Devil?\n\nThe MONK stops reading and raises his head. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMONK \n</b>\t\tYou must not talk to her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tCan that be so dangerous?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMONK \n</b>\t\tI don't know, but she is believed to have \n\t\tcaused the pestilence with which we are \n\t\taffected. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI understand.\n\nHe nods resignedly and walks away. The young woman starts to moan as though \nshe were having a horrible nightmare. The sound of her cries follows the two \nriders for a considerable distance down the road.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe sun stands high in the sky, like a red ball of fire. The waterskin is \nempty and JONS looks for a well where he can fill it.\n\nThey approach a group of peasant cottages at the edge of the forest. JONS \nties up the horses, slings the skin over his shoulder and walks along the \npath towards the nearest cottage. As always, his movements are light and \nalmost soundless. The door to the cottage is open. He stops outside, but when \nno one appears he enters. It is very dark inside and his foot touches a soft \nobject. He looks down. Beside the whitewashed fireplace, a woman is lying \nwith her face to the ground.\n\nAt the sound of approaching steps, JONS quickly hides behind the door. A man \ncomes down a ladder from the loft. He is broad and thick-set. His eyes are \nblack and his face is pale and puffy. His clothes are well cut but dirty and \nin rags. He carries a cloth sack. Looking around, he goes into the inner \nroom, bends over the bed, tucks something into the bag, slinks along the \nwalls, looking on the shelves, finds something else which he tucks in his \nbag.\n\nSlowly he re-enters the outer room, bends over the dead woman and carefully \nslips a ring from her finger. At that moment a young woman comes through the \ndoor. She stops and stares at the stranger.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tWhy do you look so surprised? I steal from the \n\t\tdead. These days it's quite a lucrative \n\t\tenterprise. \n\nThe GIRL makes a movement as if to run away. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tYou're thinking of running to the village and \n\t\ttelling. That wouldn't serve any purpose. Each \n\t\tof us has to save his own skin. It's as simple \n\t\tas that. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGIRL \n</b>\t\tDon't touch me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tDon't try to scream. There's no one around to \n\t\thear you, neither God nor man.\n\nSlowly he closes the door behind the GIRL. The stuffy room is now in almost \ntotal darkness. But JONS becomes clearly visible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI recognize you, although it's a long time \n\t\tsince we met. Your name is Raval, from the \n\t\ttheological college at Roskilde. You are Dr. \n\t\tMirabilis, Coelestis et Diabilis. \n\nRAVAL smiles uneasily and looks around. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAm I not right?\n\nThe GIRL stands immobile.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou were the one who, ten years ago, convinced \n\t\tmy master of the necessity to join a better-\n\t\tclass crusade to the Holy Land.\n\nRAVAL looks around.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou look uncomfortable. Do you have a stomach-\n\t\tache? \n\nRAVAL smiles anxiously.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhen I see you, I suddenly understand the \n\t\tmeaning of these ten years, which previously \n\t\tseemed to me such a waste. Our life was too \n\t\tgood and we were too satisfied with ourselves. \n\t\tThe Lord wanted to punish us for our \n\t\tcomplacency. That is why He sent you to spew \n\t\tout your holy venom and poison the knight.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tI acted in good faith.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tBut now you know better, don't you? Because \n\t\tnow you have turned into a thief. A more \n\t\tfitting and rewarding occupation for \n\t\tscoundrels. Isn't that so?\n\nWith a quick movement he knocks the knife out of RAVAL'S hand, gives him a \nkick so that he falls on the floor and is about to finish him off. Suddenly \nthe GIRL screams. JONS stops and makes a gesture of generosity with his hand.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tBy all means. I'm not bloodthirsty. \n\nHe bends over RAVAL. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tDon't beat me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI don't have the heart to touch you, Doctor. \n\t\tBut remember this: the next time we meet, I'll \n\t\tbrand your face the way one does with thieves. \n\t\t\t(he rises)\n\t\tWhat I really came for is to get my waterskin \n\t\tfilled.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGIRL \n</b>\t\tWe have a deep well with cool, fresh water. \n\t\tCome, I'll show you.\n\nThey walk out of the house. RAVAL lies still for a few moments, then he rises \nslowly and looks around. When no one is in sight, he takes his bag and steals \naway. JONS quenches his thirst and fills his bag with water. The GIRL helps \nhim.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tJns is my name. I am a pleasant and talkative \n\t\tyoung man who has never had anything but kind \n\t\tthoughts and has only done beautiful and noble \n\t\tdeeds. I'm kindest of all to young women. With \n\t\tthem, there is no limit to my kindness. \n\nHe embraces her and tries to kiss her, but she holds herself back. Almost \nimmediately he loses interest, hoists the waterbag on his shoulder and pats \nthe GIRL on the cheek.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tGoodbye, my girl. I could very well have raped \n\t\tyou, but between you and me, I'm tired of that \n\t\tkind of love. It runs a little dry in the end.\n\nHe laughs kindly and walks away from her. When he has walked a short distance \nhe turns; the GIRL is still there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNow that I think of it, I will need a \n\t\thousekeeper. Can you prepare good food? \n\t\t\t(the GIRL nods)\n\t\tAs far as I know, I'm still a married man, but\n\t\tI have high hopes that my wife is dead by now.\n\t\tThat's why I need a housekeeper. \n\t\t\t(the GIRL doesn't \n\t\t\tanswer but gets up)\n\t\tThe devil with it! Come along and don't stand \n\t\tthere staring. I've saved your life, so you owe \n\t\tme a great deal.\n\nShe begins walking towards him, her head bent. He doesn't wait for her but \nwalks towards the KNIGHT, who patiently awaits his squire.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe Embarrassment Inn lies in the eastern section of the province. The plague \nhas not yet reached this area on its way along the coast.\n\nThe actors have placed their wagon under a tree in the yard of the inn. \nDressed in colorful costumes, they perform a farce.\n\nThe spectators watch the performance, commenting on it noisily. There are\nmerchants with fat, beer-sweaty faces, apprentices and journeymen, farmhands \nand milkmaids. A whole flock of children perch in the trees around the wagon.\n<b> \n</b>The KNIGHT and his squire have sat down in the shadow of a wall. They drink \nbeer and doze in the midday heat. The GIRL from the deserted village sleeps \nat JONS'S side. SKAT beats the drums, JOF blows the flute, MIA performs a gay \nand lively dance. They perspire under the hot white sun. When they have \nfinished SKAT comes forward and bows.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tNoble ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for \n\t\tyour interest. Please remain standing for a\n\t\tlittle longer, or sit on the ground, because \n\t\twe are now going to perform a tragedia about \n\t\tan unfaithful wife, her jealous husband, and \n\t\tthe handsome lover -- that's me.\n\nMIA and JOF have quickly changed costumes and again step out on the stage. \nThey bow, to the public. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tHere is the husband. Here is the wife. If \n\t\tyou'll shut up over there, you'll see something \n\t\tsplendid. As I said, I play the lover and I \n\t\thaven't entered yet. That's why I'm going to \n\t\thide behind the curtain for the time being. \n\t\t\t(he wipes the sweat \n\t\t\tfrom his forehead)\n\t\tIt's damned hot. I think we'll have a \n\t\tthunderstorm.\n\nHe places his leg in front of JOF as if to trip him, raises MIA's skirt, \nmakes a face as if he could see all the wonders of the world underneath it, \nand disappears behind the gaudily patched curtains.\n\nSKAT is very handsome, now that he can see himself in the reflection of a tin \nwashbowl. His hair is tightly curled, his eyebrows are beautifully bushy, \nglittering earrings vie for equal attention with his teeth, and his cheeks \nare flushed rose red.\n<b> \n</b>He sits out in back on the tailboard of the wagon, dangling his legs and \nwhistling to himself.\n<b> \n</b>In the meantime JOF and MIA play their tragedy; it is not, however, received \nwith great acclaim. SKAT suddenly discovers that someone is watching him as \nhe gazes contentedly into the tin bowl. A woman stands there, stately in both \nheight and volume.\n<b> \n</b>SKAT frowns, toys with his small dagger and occasionally throws a roguish but \nfiery glance at the beautiful visitor. She suddenly discovers that one of her \nshoes doesn't quite fit. She leans down to fix it and in doing so allows her \ngenerous bosom to burst out of its prison -- no more than honor and chastity \nallow, but still enough so that the actor with his experienced eye \nimmediately sees that there are ample rewards to be had here.\n\nNow she comes a little closer, kneels down and opens a bundle containing \nseveral dainty morsels and a skin filled with red wine. JONAS SKAT manages \nnot to fall off the wagon in his excitement. Standing on the steps of the \nwagon, he supports himself against a nearby tree, crosses his legs and bows.\n<b> \n</b>The woman quietly bites into a chicken leg dripping with fat. At this moment \nthe actor is stricken by a radiant glance full of lustful appetites.\n\nWhen he sees this look, SKAT makes an instantaneous decision, jumps down from \nthe wagon and kneels in front of the blushing damsel.\n\nShe becomes weak and faint from his nearness, looks at him with a glassy \nglance and breathes heavily. SKAT doesn't neglect to press kisses on her \nsmall, chubby hands. The sun shines brightly and small birds make noises in \nthe bushes.\n\nNow she is forced to sit back; her legs seem unwilling to support her any \nlonger. Bewildered, she singles out another chicken leg from the large sack \nof food and holds it up in front of SKAT with an appealing and triumphant \nexpression, as if it were her maidenhood being offered as a prize.\n\nSKAT hesitates momentarily, but he is still the strategist. He lets the \nchicken leg fall to the grass, and murmurs in the woman's rosy ear.\n\nHis words seem to please her. She puts her arms around the actor's neck and \npulls him to her with such fierceness that both of them lose their balance \nand tumble down on the soft grass. The small birds take to their wings with \nfrightened shrieks.\n\n\n\nJOF stands in the hot sun with a flickering lantern in his hand. MIA pretends \nto be asleep on a bench which has been pulled forward on the stage. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tNight and moonlight now prevail \n\t\tHere sleeps my wife so frail ... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE FROM THE PUBLIC\n</b>\t\tDoes she snore?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tMay I point out that this is a tragedy, and in \n\t\ttragedies one doesn't snore.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE FROM THE PUBLIC\n</b>\t\tI think she should snore anyhow. \n\nThis opinion causes mirth in the audience. JOF becomes slightly confused and \ngoes out of character, but MIA keeps her head and begins snoring. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tNight and moonlight now prevail.\n\t\tThere snores -- I mean sleeps -- my wife so frail. \n\t\tJealous I am, as never before, \n\t\tI hide myself behind this door. \n\t\tFaithful is she \n\t\tTo her lover -- not me. \n\t\tHe soon comes a-stealing \n\t\tTo awaken her lusty feeling. \n\t\tI shall now kill him dead \n\t\tFor cuckolding me in my bed. \n\t\tThere he comes in the moonlight, \n\t\tHis white legs shining bright. \n\t\tQuiet as a mouse, here I'll lie, \n\t\tTell him not that he's about to die.\n\nJOF hides himself. MIA immediately ends her snoring and sits up, looking to \nthe left. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tLook, there he comes in the night \n\t\tMy lover, my heart's delight.\n\nShe becomes silent and looks wide-eyed in front of her. The mood in the yard \nin front of the inn has, up to now, been rather lighthearted despite the \nheat.\n<b> \n</b>Now a rapid change occurs. People who had been laughing and chattering fall \nsilent. Their faces seem to pale under their sunbrowned skins, the children \nstop their games and stand with gaping mouths and frightened eyes.\n<b> \n</b>JOF steps out in front of the curtain. His painted face bears an expression \nof horror. MIA has risen with MIKAEL in her arms. Some of the women in the \nyard have fallen on their knees, others hide their faces, many begin to \nmutter half-forgotten prayers.\n\nAll have turned their faces towards the white road. Now a shrill song is \nheard. It is frenzied, almost a scream. A crucified Christ sways above the \nhilltop.\n\nThe cross-bearers soon come into sight. They are Dominican monks, their hoods \npulled down over their faces. More and more of them follow, carrying litters \nwith heavy coffins or clutching holy relics, their hands stretched out \nspasmodically. The dust wells up around their black hoods; the censers sway \nand emit a thick, ashen smoke which smells of rancid herbs.\n\nAfter the line of monks comes another procession. It is a column of men, \nboys, old men, women, girls, children. All of them have steel-edged scourges \nin their hands with which they whip themselves and each other, howling \necstatically. They twist in pain; their eyes bulge wildly; their lips are \ngnawed to shreds and dripping with foam. They have been seized by madness. \nThey bite their own hands and arms, whip each other in violent, almost \nrhythmic outbursts. Throughout it all the shrill song howls from their \nbursting throats. Many sway and fall, lift themselves up again, support each\nother and help each other to intensify the scourging.\n\nNow the procession pauses at the crossroads in front of the inn. The monks \nfall on their knees, hiding their faces with clenched hands, arms pressed \ntightly together. Their song never stops. The Christ figure on its timbered \ncross is raised above the heads of the crowd. It is not Christ triumphant, \nbut the suffering Jesus with the sores, the blood, the hammered nails and the \nface in convulsive pain. The Son of God, nailed on the wood of the cross, \nsuffering scorn and shame.\n<b> \n</b>The penitents have now sunk down in the dirt of the road. They collapse where \nthey stood like slaughtered cattle. Their screams rise with the song of the \nmonks, through misty clouds of incense, towards the white fire of the sun.\n<b> \n</b>A large square monk rises from his knees and reveals his face, which is red-\nbrown from the sun. His eyes glitter; his voice is thick with impotent scorn.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMONK\n</b>\t\tGod has sentenced us to punishment. We shall \n\t\tall perish in the black death. You, standing \n\t\tthere like gaping cattle, you who sit there in \n\t\tyour glutted complacency, do you know that this \n\t\tmay be your last hour? Death stands right \n\t\tbehind you. I can see how his crown gleams in \n\t\tthe sun. His scythe flashes as he raises it \n\t\tabove your heads. Which one of you shall he \n\t\tstrike first? You there, who stand staring like \n\t\ta goat, will your mouth be twisted into the \n\t\tlast unfinished gasp before nightfall? And you, \n\t\twoman, who bloom with life and self-\n\t\tsatisfaction, will you pale and become \n\t\textinguished before the morning dawns? You back\n\t\tthere, with your swollen nose and stupid grin, \n\t\tdo you have another year left to dirty the \n\t\tearth with your refuse? Do you know, you \n\t\tinsensible fools, that you shall die today or \n\t\ttomorrow, or the next day, because all of you \n\t\thave been sentenced? Do you hear what I say? Do \n\t\tyou hear the word? You have been sentenced, \n\t\tsentenced! \n\nThe MONK falls silent, looking around with a bitter face and a cold, scornful\nglance. Now, he clenches his hands, straddles the ground and turns his face\nupwards. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMONK\n</b>\t\tLord have mercy on us in our humiliation! Don't \n\t\tturn your face from us in loathing and \n\t\tcontempt, but be merciful to us for the sake of \n\t\tyour son, Jesus Christ. \n\nHe makes the sign of the cross over the crowd and then begins a new song in a\nstrong voice. The monks rise and join in the song. As if driven by some \nsuperhuman force, the penitents begin to whip themselves again, still wailing \nand moaning.\n\nThe procession continues. New members have joined the rear of the column; \nothers who were unable to go on lie weeping in the dust of the road. JONS the \nsquire drinks his beer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThis damned ranting about doom. Is that food \n\t\tfor the minds of modern people? Do they really \n\t\texpect us to take them seriously?\n\nThe KNIGHT grins tiredly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYes, now you grin at me, my lord. But allow me \n\t\tto point out that I've either read, heard or \n\t\texperienced most of the tales which we people \n\t\ttell each other. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(yawns) \n\t\tYes, yes.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tEven the ghost stories about God the Father, \n\t\tthe angels, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost --\n\t\tall these I've accepted without too much \n\t\temotion.\n\nHe leans down over the GIRL as she crouches at his feet and pats her on the \nhead. The KNIGHT drinks his beer silently.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(contentedly)\n\t\tMy little stomach is my world, my head is my \n\t\teternity, and my hands, two wonderful suns. My \n\t\tlegs are time's damned pendulums, and my dirty \n\t\tfeet are two splendid starting points for my \n\t\tphilosophy. Everything is worth precisely as \n\t\tmuch as a belch, the only difference being that \n\t\ta belch is more satisfying.\n\nThe beer mug is empty. Sighing, JONS gets to his feet. The GIRL follows him \nlike a shadow.\n\nIn the yard he meets a large man with a sooty face and a dark expression. He \nstops JONS with a roar. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhat are you screaming about?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI am Plog, the smith, and you are the squire \n\t\tJns. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThat's possible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tHave you seen my wife?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNo, I haven't. But if I had seen her and she \n\t\tlooked like you, I'd quickly forget that I'd \n\t\tseen her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG\n</b>\t\tWell, in that case you haven't seen her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tMaybe she's run off. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tDo you know anything?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI know quite a lot, but not about your wife. Go \n\t\tto the inn. Maybe they can help you.\n\nThe smith sighs sadly and goes inside.\n\nThe inn is very small and full of people eating and drinking to forget their \nnewly aroused fears of eternity. In the open fireplace a roasting pig turns\non an iron spit. The sun shines outside the casement window, its sharp rays\npiercing the darkness of the room, which is thick with fumes and\nperspiration.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMERCHANT\n</b>\t\tYes, it's true! The plague is spreading along \n\t\tthe west coast. People are dying like flies. \n\t\tUsually business would be good at this time of \n\t\tyear, but, damn it, I've still got my whole \n\t\tstock unsold.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN \n</b>\t\tThey speak of the judgment day. And all these \n\t\tomens are terrible. Worms, chopped-off hands \n\t\tand other monstrosities began pouring out of \n\t\tan old woman, and down in the village another \n\t\twoman gave birth to a calf's head. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN \n</b>\t\tThe day of judgment. Imagine.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFARMER\n</b>\t\tIt hasn't rained here for a month. We'll surely \n\t\tlose our crops.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMERCHANT\n</b>\t\tAnd people are acting crazy, I'd say. They flee \n\t\tthe country and carry the plague with them \n\t\twherever they go. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN \n</b>\t\tThe day of judgment. Just think, just think! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFARMER \n</b>\t\tIf it's as they say, I suppose a person should \n\t\tlook after his house and try to enjoy life as \n\t\tlong as he can. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN \n</b>\t\tBut there have been other things too, such \n\t\tthings that can't even be spoken of. \n\t\t\t(whispers)\n\t\tThings that mustn't be named -- but the priests \n\t\tsay that the woman carries it between her legs \n\t\tand that's why she must cleanse herself. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN \n</b>\t\tJudgment day. And the Riders of the Apocalypse \n\t\tstand at the bend in the village road. I \n\t\timagine they'll come on judgment night, at \n\t\tsundown.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN \n</b>\t\tThere are many who have purged themselves with\n\t \tfire and died from it, but the priests say that \n\t\tit's better to die pure than to live for hell.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMERCHANT \n</b>\t\tThis is the end, yes, it is. No one says it out\n\t\tloud, but all of us know that it's the end. And \n\t\tpeople are going mad from fear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFARMER\n</b>\t\tSo you're afraid too. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMERCHANT\n</b>\t\tOf course I'm afraid.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN \n</b>\t\tThe judgment day becomes night, and the angels \n\t\tdescend and the graves open. It will be \n\t\tterrible to see. \n\nThey whisper in low tones and sit close to each other.\n\n\n\nPLOG, the smith, shoves his way into a place next to JOF, who is still \ndressed in his costume. Opposite him sits RAVAL, leaning slightly forward, \nhis face perspiring heavily. RAVAL rolls an armlet out on the table. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tDo you want this armlet? You can have it \n\t\tcheap. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI can't afford it. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tIt's real silver.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tIt's nice. But it's surely too expensive for \n\t\tme. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tExcuse me, but has anyone here seen my wife? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tHas she disappeared? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tThey say she's run away. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tHas she deserted you? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tWith an actor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAn actor! If she's got such bad taste, then I \n\t\tthink you should let her go.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYou're right. My first thought, of course, was \n\t\tto kill her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tOh. But to murder her, that's a terrible thing \n\t\tto do. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI'm also going to kill the actor. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThe actor?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tOf course, the one she eloped with. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWhat has he done to deserve that? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tAre you stupid?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThe actor! Now I understand. There are too many \n\t\tof them, so even if he hasn't done anything in \n\t\tparticular you ought to kill him merely because \n\t\the's an actor. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYou see, my wife has always been interested in \n\t\tthe tricks of the theatre.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAnd that turned out to be her misfortune. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tHer misfortune, but not mine, because a person \n\t\twho's born unfortunate can hardly suffer from \n\t\tany further misfortune. Isn't that true?\n\nNow RAVAL enters the discussion. He is slightly drunk and his voice is shrill \nand evil.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tListen, you! You sit there and lie to the \n\t\tsmith. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI! A liar!\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tYou're an actor too and it's probably your \n\t\tpartner who's run off with Plog's old lady. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tAre you an actor too?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAn actor! Me! I wouldn't quite call myself that! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tWe ought to kill you; it's only logical. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tYou're really funny.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tHow strange -- you've turned pale. Have you \n\t\tanything on your conscience?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tYou're funny. Don't you think he's funny? \n\t\t\t(to Plog)\n\t\tOh, you don't.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tMaybe we should mark you up a little with a \n\t\tknife, like they do petty scoundrels of your \n\t\tkind.\n\nPLOG bangs his hands down on the table so that the dishes jump. He gets up.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(shouting)\n\t\tWhat have you done with my wife? \n\nThe room becomes silent. JOF looks around, but there is no exit, no way to \nescape. He puts his hands on the table. Suddenly a knife flashes through the \nair and sinks into the table top between his fingers.\n\nJOF snatches away his hands and raises his head. He looks half surprised, as \nif the truth had just become apparent to him.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tDo you want to hurt me? Why? Have I provoked \n\t\tsomeone, or got in the way? I'll leave right \n\t\tnow and never come back.\n\nJOF looks from one face to another, but no one seems ready to help him or \ncome to his defense.\n<b> \n</b><b> \t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tGet up so everyone can hear you. Talk louder. \n\nTrembling, JOF rises. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but not a \nword comes out.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tStand on your head so that we can see how good \n\t\tan actor you are.\n\nJOF gets up on the table and stands on his head. A hand pushes him forward so\nthat he collapses on the floor. PLOG rises, pulls him to his feet with one \nhand. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(shouts) \n\t\tWhat have you done with my wife? \n\nPLOG beats him so furiously that JOF flies across the table. RAVAL leans over\nhim.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tDon't lie there moaning. Get up and dance. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI don't want to. I can't.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tShow us how you imitate a bear. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI can't play a bear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tLet's see if you can't after all.\n\nRAVAL prods JOF lightly with the knife point. JOF gets up with cold sweat on \nhis cheeks and forehead, frightened half to death. He begins to jump and hop \non top of the tables, swinging his arms and legs and making grotesque faces.\nSome laugh, but most of the people sit silently. JOF gasps as if his lungs \nwere about to burst. He sinks to his knees, and someone pours beer over him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tUp again! Be a good bear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI haven't done any harm. I haven't got the \n\t\tstrength to play a bear any more.\n\nAt that moment the door opens and JONS enters. JOF sees his chance and steals\nout. RAVAL intends to follow him, but suddenly stops. JONS and RAVAL look at \neach other. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDo you remember what I was going to do to you \n\t\tif we met again?\n\nRAVAL steps back without speaking. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI'm a man who keeps his word.\n\nJONS raises his knife and cuts RAVAL from forehead to cheek. RAVAL staggers \ntowards the wall.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe hot day has become night. Singing and howling can be heard from the inn. \nIn a hollow near the forest, the light still lingers. Hidden in the grass and\nthe shrubbery, nightingales sing and their voices echo through the stillness.\n<b> \n</b>The players' wagon stands in a small ravine, and not far away the horse \ngrazes on the dry grass. MIA has sat down in front of the wagon with her son \nin her arms. They play together and laugh happily.\n\nNow, a soft gleam of light strokes the hilltops, a last reflection from the \nred clouds over the sea.\n\nNot far from the wagon, the KNIGHT sits crouched over his chess game. He \nlifts his head.\n\nThe evening light moves across the heavy wagon wheels, across the woman and \nthe child. The KNIGHT gets up.\n\nMIA sees him and smiles. She holds up her struggling son, as if to amuse the \n<b>KNIGHT. \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhat's his name? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tMikael.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHow old is he? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tOh, he'll soon be two. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHe's big for his age.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you think so? Yes, I guess he's rather big. \n\nShe puts the child down on the ground and half rises to shake out her red \nskirt. When she sits down again, the KNIGHT steps closer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou played some kind of show this afternoon. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDid you think it was bad?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou are more beautiful now without your face \n\t\tpainted, and this gown is more becoming.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYou see, Jonas Skat has run off and left us, \n\t\tso we're in real trouble now.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tIs that your husband?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tJonas! The other man is my husband. His name is \n\t\tJof.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tOh, that one.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tAnd now there's only him and me. We'll have to \n\t\tstart doing tricks again and that's more \n\t\ttrouble than it's worth. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tDo you do tricks also?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWe certainly do. And Jof is a very skillful \n\t\tjuggler.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tIs Mikael going to be an acrobat? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tJof wants him to be. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tBut you don't.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI don't know.\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tPerhaps he'll become a knight. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tLet me assure you, that's no pleasure either. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNo, you don't look so happy. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNo.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tAre you tired? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYes. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhy?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI have dull company. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you mean your squire? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNo, not him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWho do you mean, then? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tMyself. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI understand. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tDo you, really?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYes, I understand rather well. I have often \n\t\twondered why people torture themselves as often \n\t\tas they can. Isn't that so?\n\nShe nods energetically and the KNIGHT smiles seriously. Now the shrieks and \nthe noise from the inn become louder. Black figures flicker across the grass \nmound. Someone collapses, gets up and runs. It is JOF. MIA stretches out her \narms and receives him. He holds his hands in front of his face, moaning like \na child, and his body sways. He kneels. MIA holds him close to her and \nsprinkles him with small, anxious questions: What have you done? How are you?\nWhat is it? Does it hurt? What can I do? Have they been cruel to you? She \nruns for a rag, which she dips in water, and carefully bathes her husband's\ndirty, bloody face.\n<b> \n</b>Eventually a rather sorrowful visage emerges. Blood runs from a bruise on his \nforehead and his nose, and a tooth has been loosened, but otherwise JOF seems \nunhurt. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tOuch, it hurts.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tWhy did you have to go there? And of course you \n\t\tdrank.\n\nMIA's anxiety has been replaced by a mild anger. She pats him a little harder \nthan necessary. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tOuch! I didn't drink anything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tThen I suppose you were boasting about the \n\t\tangels and devils you consort with. People \n\t\tdon't like someone who has too many ideas and \n\t\tfantasies.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI swear to you that I didn't say a word about \n\t\tangels. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tYou were, of course, busy singing and dancing. \n\t\tYou can never stop being an actor. People also \n\t\tbecome angry at that, and you know it.\n\nJOF doesn't answer but searches for the armlet. He holds it up in front of \nMIA with an injured expression. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tLook what I bought for you. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYou couldn't afford it. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(angry)\n\t\tBut I got it anyhow.\n\nThe armlet glitters faintly in the twilight. MIA now pulls it across her \nwrist. They look at it in silence, and their faces soften. They look at each \nother, touch each other's hands. JOF puts his head against MIA'S shoulder and \nsighs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tOh, how they beat me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhy didn't you beat them back?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI only become frightened and angry. I never get \n\t\ta chance to hit back. I can get angry, you know \n\t\tthat. I roared like a lion.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tWere they frightened? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tNo, they just laughed.\n\nTheir son MIKAEL crawls over to them. JOF lies down on the ground and pulls \nhis son on top of him. MIA gets down on her hands and knees and playfully \nsniffs at MIKAEL.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you notice how good he smells?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAnd he is so compact to hold. You're a sturdy \n\t\tone. A real acrobat's body.\n\nHe lifts MIKAEL up and holds him by the legs. MIA looks up suddenly, \nremembering the knight's presence. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYes, this is my husband, Jof. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tGood evening. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tGood evening.\n<b> \n</b>JOF becomes a little embarrassed and rises. All three of them look at one \nanother silently.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI have just told your wife that you have a \n\t\tsplendid son. He'll bring great joy to you. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tYes, he's fine.\n<b>     \n</b>They become silent again.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tHave we nothing to offer the knight, Mia? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThank you, I don't want anything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(housewifely)\n\t\tI picked a basket of wild strawberries this \n\t\tafternoon. And we have a drop of milk fresh \n\t\tfrom a cow ... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t... that we were allowed to milk. So, if you \n\t\twould like to partake of this humble fare, it \n\t\twould be a great honor. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tPlease be seated and I'll bring the food. \n\nThey sit down. MIA disappears with MIKAEL. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhere are you going next? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tUp to the saints' feast at Elsinore. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI wouldn't advise you to go there. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWhy not, if I may ask?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThe plague has spread in that direction, \n\t\tfollowing the coast line south. It's said that \n\t\tpeople are dying by the tens of thousands.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tReally! Well, sometimes life is a little hard. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tMay I suggest ... \n\t\t\t(JOF looks at him, surprised)\n \t\t... that you follow me through the forest \n\t\ttonight and stay at my home if you like. Or go \n\t\talong the east coast. You'll probably be safer \n\t\tthere.\n\nMIA has returned with a bowl of wild strawberries and the milk, places it \nbetween them and gives each of them a spoon.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI wish you good appetite. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI humbly thank you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tThese are wild strawberries from the forest. I \n\t\thave never seen such large ones. They grow up \n\t\tthere on the hillside. Notice how they smell!\n\nShe points with a spoon and smiles. The KNIGHT nods, as if he were pondering \nsome profound thought. JOF eats heartily.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tYour suggestion is good, but I must think it \n\t\tover. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tIt might be wise to have company going through \n\t\tthe forest. It's said to be full of trolls and \n\t\tghosts and bandits. That's what I've heard.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(staunchly)\n\t\tYes, I'd say that it's not a bad idea, but I \n\t\thave to think about it. Now that Skat has left, \n\t\tI am responsible for the troupe. After all, I \n\t\thave become director of the whole company.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(mimics) \n\t\tAfter all, I have become director of the whole \n\t\tcompany.\n\nJONS comes walking slowly down the hill, closely followed by the GIRL. MIA \npoints with her spoon. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you want some strawberries?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThis man saved my life. Sit down, my friend, \n\t\tand let us be together.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(stretches herself) \n\t\tOh, how nice this is. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tFor a short while.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNearly always. One day is like another. There \n\t\tis nothing strange about that. The summer, of \n\t\tcourse, is better than the winter, because in \n\t\tsummer you don't have to be cold. But spring is \n\t\tbest of all.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI have written a poem about the spring. Perhaps \n\t\tyou'd like to hear it. I'll run and get my lyre. \n\nHe sprints towards the wagon.\n<b> \n</b><b> \t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNot now, Jof. Our guests may not be amused by \n\t\tyour songs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(politely) \n\t\tBy all means. I write little songs myself. For \n\t\texample, I know a very funny song about a \n\t\twanton fish which I doubt that you've heard yet. \n\nThe KNIGHT looks at him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou'll not get to hear it either. There are \n\t\tpersons here who don't appreciate my art and I \n\t\tdon't want to upset anyone. I'm a sensitive \n\t\tsoul.\n\nJOF has come out with his lyre, sits on a small, gaudy box and plucks at the \ninstrument, humming quietly, searching for his melody. JONS yawns and lies \ndown. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tPeople are troubled by so much.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tIt's always better when one is two. Have you no \n\t\tone of your own?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYes, I think I had someone. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tAnd what is she doing now? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI don't know.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYou look so solemn. Was she your beloved? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWe were newly married and we played together. \n\t\tWe laughed a great deal. I wrote songs to her \n\t\teyes, to her nose, to her beautiful little \n\t\tears. We went hunting together and at night we \n\t\tdanced. The house was full of life ... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you want some more strawberries?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(shakes his head)\n\t\tFaith is a torment, did you know that? It is \n\t\tlike loving someone who is out there in the \n\t\tdarkness but never appears, no matter how \n\t\tloudly you call. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI don't understand what you mean.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tEverything I've said seems meaningless and \n\t\tunreal while I sit here with you and your \n\t\thusband. How unimportant it all becomes \n\t\tsuddenly.\n\nHe takes the bowl of milk in his hand and drinks deeply from it several \ntimes. Then he carefully puts it down and looks up, smiling.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNow you don't look so solemn.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI shall remember this moment. The silence, the \n\t\ttwilight, the bowls of strawberries and milk,\n\t\tyour faces in the evening light. Mikael \n\t\tsleeping, Jof with his lyre. I'll try to \n\t\tremember what we have talked about. I'll carry \n\t\tthis memory between my hands as carefully as \n\t\tif it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh \n\t\tmilk. \n\nHe turns his face away and looks out towards the sea and the colorless gray \nsky. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tAnd it will be an adequate sign -- it will be \n\t\tenough for me.\n\nHe rises, nods to the others and walks down towards the forest. JOF continues \nto play on his lyre. MIA stretches out on the grass.\n\nThe KNIGHT picks up his chess game and carries it towards the beach. It is \nquiet and deserted; the sea is still. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI have been waiting for you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tPardon me. I was detained for a few moments. \n\t\tBecause I revealed my tactics to you, I'm in \n\t\tretreat. It's your move.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhy do you look so satisfied? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThat's my secret.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tOf course. Now I take your knight. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou did the right thing. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tHave you tricked me?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tOf course.

Check! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhat are you laughing at?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tDon't worry about my laughter; save your king \n\t\tinstead.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYou're rather arrogant. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tOur game amuses me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tIt's your move.

It takes time.\n\nDEATH is about to answer him but stops and leans over the board. The KNIGHT \nsmiles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tAre you going to escort the juggler and his \n\t\twife through the forest? Those whose names are \n\t\tJof and Mia and who have a small son? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhy do you ask? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tOh, no reason at all.\n<b> \n</b>The KNIGHT suddenly stops smiling. DEATH looks at him scornfully.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nImmediately after sundown, the little company gathers in the yard of the inn.\nThere is the KNIGHT, JONS and the GIRL, JOF and MIA in their wagon. Their \nson, MIKAEL, is already asleep. JONAS SKAT is still missing. \n\nJONS goes into the inn to get provisions for the night journey and to have a \nlast mug of beer. The inn is now empty and quiet except for a few farmhands \nand maidens who are eating their evening meal in a corner. At one of the \nsmall windows sits a lonely, hunched-over fellow, with a jug of brandy in his \nhands. His expression is very sad. Once in a while he is shaken by a gigantic \nsob. It is PLOG, the smith, who sits there and whimpers. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tGod in heaven, isn't this Plog, the smith? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tGood evening.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAre you sitting here sniveling in loneliness? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYes, yes, look at the smith. He moans like a \n\t\trabbit. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tIf I were in your boots, I'd be happy to get \n\t\trid of a wife in such an easy way.\n\nJONS pats the smith on the back, quenches his thirst with beer, and sits down \nby his side. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tAre you married?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI! A hundred times and more. I can't keep count \n\t\tof all my wives any longer. But it's often that \n\t\tway when you're a traveling man.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI can assure you that one wife is worse than a \n\t\thundred, or else I've had worse luck than any \n\t\tpoor wretch in this miserable world, which \n\t\tisn't impossible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYes, it's hell with women and hell without \n\t\tthem. So, however you look at it, it's still \n\t\tbest to kill them off while it's most amusing.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tWomen's nagging, the shrieking of children and \n\t\twet diapers, sharp nails and sharp words, blows \n\t\tand pokes, and the devil's aunt for a \n\t\tmother-in-law. And then, when one wants to \n\t\tsleep after a long day, there's a new song -- \n\t\ttears, whining and moans loud enough to wake \n\t\tthe dead. \n\nJONS nods delightedly. He has drunk deeply and talks with an old woman's \nvoice. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhy don't you kiss me good night?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(in the same way)\n\t\tWhy don't you sing a song for me? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhy don't you love me the way you did when we \n\t\tfirst met?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tWhy don't you look at my new slip? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou only turn your back and snore. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tOh hell!\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tOh hell. And now she's gone. Rejoice!\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(furious) \n\t\tI'll snip their noses with pliers, I'll bash in \n\t\ttheir chests with a small hammer, I'll tap \n\t\ttheir heads ever so lightly with a sledge.\n\nPLOG begins to cry loudly and his whole body sways in an enormous attack of \nsorrow. JONS looks at him with interest.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS\n</b>\t\tLook how he howls again. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tMaybe I love her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tSo, maybe you love her! Then, you poor \n\t\tmisguided ham shank, I'll tell you that love is \n\t\tanother word for lust, plus lust, plus lust \n\t\tand a damn lot of cheating, falseness, lies and \n\t\tall kinds of other fooling around. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG\n</b>\t\tYes, but it hurts anyway.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tOf course. Love is the blackest of all plagues, \n\t\tand if one could die of it, there would be \n\t\tsome pleasure in love. But you almost always \n\t\tget over it. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG\n</b>\t\tNo, no, not me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYes, you too. There are only a couple of poor \n\t\twretches who die of love once in a while. Love \n\t\tis as contagious as a cold in the nose. It eats \n\t\taway at your strength, your independence, your \n\t\tmorale, if you have any. If everything is \n\t\timperfect in this imperfect world, love is most \n\t\tperfect in its perfect imperfection.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYou're happy, you with your oily words, and, \n\t\tbesides, you believe your own drivel.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tBelieve! Who said that I believed it? But I \n\t\tlove to give good advice. If you ask me for \n\t\tadvice you'll get two pieces for the price of \n\t\tone, because after all I really am an educated \n\t\tman.\n\nJONS gets up from the table and strokes his face with his hands. PLOG becomes \nvery unhappy and grabs his belt. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tListen, Jns. May I go with you through the \n\t\tforest? I'm so lonely and don't want to go home \n\t\tbecause everyone will laugh at me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tOnly if you don't whimper all the time, because \n\t\tin that case we'll all have to avoid you.\n\nPLOG gets up and embraces JONS. Slightly drunk, the two new friends walk \ntowards the door.\n<b> \n</b>When they come out in the yard, JOF immediately catches sight of them, \nbecomes angry and yells a warning to JONS.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tJns! Watch out. That one wants to fight all \n\t\tthe time. He's not quite sane.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYes, but now he's just sniveling.\n\nPLOG steps up to JOF, who blanches with fear. PLOG offers his hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI'm really sorry if I hurt you. But I have \n\t\tsuch a hell of a temper, you know. Shake hands.\n\nJOF gingerly proffers a frightened hand and gets it thoroughly shaken and \nsqueezed. While JOF tries to straighten out his fingers, PLOG is seized by \ngreat good will and opens his arms.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tCome in my arms, little brother.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThank you, thank you, perhaps later. But now \n\t\twe're really in a hurry.\n\nJOF climbs up on the wagon seat quickly and clucks at the horse.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe small company is on its way towards the forest and the night.\n\nIt is dark in the forest.\n<b> \n</b>First comes the KNIGHT on his large horse. Then JOF and MIA follow, sitting \nclose to each other in the juggler's wagon. MIA holds her son in her arms. \nJONS follows them with his heavily laden horse. He has the smith in tow. The \nGIRL sits on top of the load on the horse's back, hunched over as if asleep.\n\nThe footsteps, the horses' heavy tramp on the soft path, the human breathing \n-- yet it is quiet.\n<b> \n</b>Then the moon sails out of the clouds. The forest suddenly becomes alive with \nthe night's unreality. The dazzling light pours through the thick foliage of \nthe beech trees, a moving, quivering world of light and shadow.\n\nThe wanderers stop. Their eyes are dark with anxiety and foreboding. Their \nfaces are pale and unreal in the floating light. It is very quiet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG\n</b>\t\tNow the moon has come out of the clouds. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThat's good. Now we can see the road better. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI don't like the moon tonight. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThe trees stand so still.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThat's because there's no wind. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI guess he means that they stand very still. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tIt's completely quiet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tIf one could hear a fox at least. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tOr an owl.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tOr a human voice besides one's own.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\t\tThey say it's dangerous to remain standing in \n\t\tmoonlight.\n\nSuddenly, out of the silence and the dim light falling across the forest \nroad, a ghostlike cart emerges. It is the WITCH being taken to the place \nwhere she will be burned. Next to her eight soldiers shuffle along tiredly, \ncarrying their lances on their backs. The girl sits in the cart, bound with \niron chains around her throat and arms. She stares fixedly into the \nmoonlight.\n<b> \n</b>A black figure sits next to her, a monk with his hood pulled down over his \nhead. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhere are you going? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER\n</b>\t\tTo the place of execution.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYes, now I can see. It's the girl who has done \n\t\tit with the Black One. The witch?\n\nThe SOLDIER nods sourly. Hesitantly, the travelers follow. The KNIGHT guides \nhis horse over to the side of the cart. The WITCH seems to be half-conscious, \nbut her eyes are wide open.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI see that they have hurt your hands.\n\nThe WITCH'S pale, childish face turns towards the KNIGHT and she shakes her \nhead. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI have a potion that will stop your pain.\n\nShe shakes her head again.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhy do you burn her at this time of night? \n\t\tPeople have so few diversions these days.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER \n</b>\t\tSaints preserve us, be quiet! It's said that \n\t\tshe brings the Devil with her wherever she \n\t\tgoes. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou are eight brave men, then.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER \n</b>\t\tWell, we've been paid. And this is a volunteer \n\t\tjob. \n\nThe SOLDIER speaks in whispers while glancing anxiously at the WITCH.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(to the WITCH)\n\t\tWhat's your name? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN\n</b>\t\tMy name is Tyan, my lord. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHow old are you? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN\n</b>\t\tFourteen, my lord.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tAnd is it true that you have been in league \n\t\twith the Devil?\n\nTYAN nods quietly and looks away. Now they arrive at the parish border. At \nthe foot of the nearby hills lies a crossroads. The pyre has already been \nstacked in the center of the forest clearing. The travelers remain there, \nhesitant and curious.\n<b> \n</b>The soldiers have tied up the cart horse and bring out two long wooden beams.\nThey nail rungs across the beams so that it looks like a ladder. TYAN will be \nbound to this like an eelskin stretched out to dry.\n\nThe sound of the hammering echoes through the forest. The KNIGHT has \ndismounted and walks closer to the cart. Again he tries to catch TYAN'S eyes, \ntouches her very lightly as if to waken her. Slowly she turns her face \ntowards him.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThey say that you have been in league with the \n\t\tDevil.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN\n</b>\t\tWhy do you ask?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNot out of curiosity, but for very personal \n\t\treasons. I too want to meet him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tWhy?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI want to ask him about God. He, if anyone, \n\t\tmust know.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tYou can see him anytime. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHow?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tYou must do as I tell you.\n\nThe KNIGHT grips the wooden rail of the cart so tightly that his knuckles \nwhiten. TYAN leans forward and joins her gaze with his. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tLook into my eyes.\n\nThe KNIGHT meets her gaze. They stare at each other for a long time.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tWhat do you see? Do you see him?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI see fear in your eyes, an empty, numb fear. \n\t\tBut nothing else.\n\nHe falls silent. The soldiers work at the stakes; their hammering echoes in \nthe forest. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tNo one, nothing, no one? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(shakes his head)\n\t\tNo.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN\n</b>\t\tCan't you see him behind your back? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(looks around) \n\t\tNo, there is no one there. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tBut he is with me everywhere. I only have to \n\t\tstretch out my hand and I can feel his hand. He \n\t\tis with me now too. The fire won't hurt me. He \n\t\twill protect me from everything evil.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHas he told you this? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tI know it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHas he said it?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tI know it, I know it. You must see him \n\t\tsomewhere, you must. The priests had no \n\t\tdifficulty seeing him, nor did the soldiers. \n\t\tThey are so afraid of him that they don't even \n\t\tdare touch me.\n\nThe sounds of the hammers stops. The soldiers stand like black shadows rooted \nin the moss. They fumble with the chains and pull at the neck iron. TYAN \nmoans weakly, as if she were far away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhy have you crushed her hands? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER\n</b>\t\t\t(surly) \n\t\tWe didn't do it. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWho did? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER\n</b>\t\tAsk the monk.\n\nThe soldiers pull the iron and the chains. TYAN'S shaven head sways, gleaming \nin the moonlight. Her blackened mouth opens as if to scream, but no sound \nemerges. They take her down from the cart and lead her towards the ladder and \nthe stake. The KNIGHT turns to the MONK, who remains seated in the cart. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhat have you done with the child? \n\nDEATH turns around and looks at him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tDon't you ever stop asking questions? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNo, I'll never stop.\n\nThe soldiers chain TYAN to the rungs of the ladder. She submits resignedly, \nmoans weakly like an animal and tries to ease her body into position.\n<b> \n</b>When they have fastened her, they walk over to light the pyre. The KNIGHT \nsteps up and leans over her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tFor a moment I thought of killing the soldiers, \n\t\tbut it would do no good. She's nearly dead \n\t\talready. \n\nOne of the soldiers approaches. Thick smoke wells down from the pyre and \nsweeps over the quiet shadows near the crossroads and the hill.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER\n</b>\t\tI've told you to be careful. Don't go too close \n\t\tto her.\n\nThe KNIGHT doesn't heed this warning. He cups his hand, fills it with water \nfrom the skin and gives it to TYAN. Then he gives her a potion.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tTake this and it will stop the pain.\n\nSmoke billows down over them and they begin to cough. The soldiers step \nforward and raise the ladder against a nearby fir tree. TYAN hangs there \nmotionlessly, her eyes wide open.\n\nThe KNIGHT straightens up and stands immobile. JONS is behind him, his voice \nnearly choked with rage. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhat does she see? Can you tell me? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(shakes his head) \n\t\tShe feels no more pain. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou don't answer my question. Who watches over \n\t\tthat child? Is it the angels, or God, or the \n\t\tDevil, or only the emptiness? Emptiness, my \n\t\tlord!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThis cannot be.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tLook at her eyes, my lord. Her poor brain has \n\t\tjust made a discovery. Emptiness under the \n\t\tmoon. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNo.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWe stand powerless, our arms hanging at our \n\t\tsides, because we see what she sees, and our \n\t\tterror and hers are the same. \n\t\t\t(an outburst) \n\t\tThat poor little child. I can't stand it, I \n\t\tcan't stand it ...\n\nHis voice sticks in his throat and he suddenly walks away. The KNIGHT mounts\nhis horse. The travelers depart from the crossroads. TYAN finally closes her \neyes.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe forest is now very dark. The road winds between the trees. The wagon \nsqueaks and rattles over stones and roots. A bird suddenly shrieks.\n<b> \n</b>JOF lifts his head and wakes up. He has been asleep with his arms around \nMIA's shoulders. The KNIGHT is sharply silhouetted against the tree trunks.\n\nHis silence makes him seem almost unreal. JONS and PLOG are slightly drunk \nand support each other. Suddenly PLOG has to sit down. He puts his hands over \nhis face and howls piteously. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tOh, now it came over me again! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDon't scream. What came over you?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tMy wife, damn it. She is so beautiful. She is \n\t\tso beautiful that she can't be described \n\t\twithout the accompaniment of a lyre.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNow it starts again.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tHer smile is like brandy. Her eyes like \n\t\tblackberries ...\n\nPLOG searches for beautiful words. He gestures gropingly with his large \nhands.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(sighs) \n\t\tGet up, you tear-drenched pig. We'll lose the \n\t\tothers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYes, of course, of course. Her nose is like a \n\t\tlittle pink potato; her behind is like a juicy \n\t\tpear -- yes, the whole woman is like a \n\t\tstrawberry patch. I can see her in front of me, \n\t\twith arms like wonderful cucumbers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tSaints almighty, stop! You're a very bad poet, \n\t\tdespite the fact that you're drunk. And your \n\t\tvegetable garden bores me.\n\nThey walk across an open meadow. Here it is a little brighter and the moon \nshimmers behind a thin sky. Suddenly PLOG points a large finger towards the \nedge of the forest. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tLook there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDo you see something? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tThere, over there! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI don't see anything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tHang on to something, my friends. The hour is \n\t\tnear! Who is that at the edge of the forest if \n\t\tnot my own dearly beloved, with actor attached?\n\nThe two lovers discover PLOG and it's too late. They cannot retreat. SKAT \nimmediately takes to his heels. PLOG chases him, swinging his sledge and \nbellowing like a wild boar.\n\nFor a few confusing moments the two rivals stumble among the stones and \nbushes in the gray gloom of the forest. The duel begins to look senseless, \nbecause both of them are equally frightened.\n\nThe travelers silently observe this confused performance. LISA screams once \nin a while, more out of duty than out of impulse.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\t\t(panting) \n\t\tYou miserable stubbleheaded bastard of seven \n\t\tscurvy bitches, if I were in your lousy rags I \n\t\twould be stricken with such eternal shame about \n\t\tmy breath, my voice, my arms and legs -- in \n\t\tshort, about my whole body -- that I would \n\t\timmediately rid nature of my own embarrassing \n\t\tself. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(angry) \n\t\tWatch out, you perfumed slob, that I don't fart \n\t\ton you and immediately blow you down to the \n\t\tactor's own red-hot hell, where you can sit and \n\t\trecite monologues to each other until the dust \n\t\tcomes out of the Devil's ears. \n\nThen LISA throws herself around her husband's neck. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tForgive me, dear little husband, I'll never do \n\t\tit again.

Kill him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(embarrassed) \n\t\tHe has to fight me, otherwise I can't kill him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tYour life's thread now hangs by a very ragged \n\t\tshred. Idiot, your day is short.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYou'll have to irritate me a little more to get \n\t\tme as angry as before.\n\nSKAT looks at the travelers with a pained expression and then lifts his eyes \ntowards the night sky. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tI forgive all of you. Pray for me sometimes. \n\nSKAT sinks the dagger into his breast and slowly falls to the ground. The \ntravelers stand confused. PLOG rushes forward and begins to pull at SKAT'S hands. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tOh dear, dear, I didn't mean it that way! Look, \n\t\tthere's no life left in him. I was beginning to \n\t\tlike him, and in my opinion Lisa was much too \n\t\tspiteful. \n\nJOF leans over his colleague.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tHe's dead, totally, enormously dead. In fact, \n\t\tI've never seen such a dead actor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tCome on, let's go. This is nothing to mourn \n\t\tover. He has only himself to blame.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tAnd I have to be married to her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWe must go on.\n\nSKAT lies in the grass and keeps the dagger pressed tightly to his breast. \nThe travelers depart and soon they have disappeared into the dark forest on \nthe other side of the meadow. When SKAT is sure that no one can see him, he \nsits up and lifts the dagger from his breast. It is a stage dagger with a \nblade that pushes into the handle. SKAT laughs to himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tNow that was a good scene. I'm really a good \n\t\tactor. After all, why shouldn't I be a little \n\t\tpleased with myself? But where shall I go? I'll \n\t\twait until it becomes light and then I'll find \n\t\tthe easiest way out of the forest. I'll climb \n\t\tup a tree for the time being so that no bears, \n\t\twolves or ghosts can get at me.\n\nHe soon finds a likely tree and climbs up into its thick foliage. He sits \ndown as comfortably as possible and reaches for his food pouch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\t\t(yawns) \n\t\tTomorrow I'll find Jof and Mia and then we'll \n\t\tgo to the saints' feast in Elsinore. We'll make \n\t\tlots of money there. \n\t\t\t(yawns)\n\t\tNow, I'll sing a little song to myself: \n\t\t\t(sings) \n\t\tI am a little bird \n\t\tWho sings whate'er he will, \n\t\tAnd when I am in danger \n\t\tI fling out a pissing trill \n\t\tAs in the carnal thrill.\n\t\t\t(speaks)\n\t\tIt's boring to be alone in the forest tonight. \n\t\t\t(sings) \n\t\tThe terrible night doesn't frighten me ... \n\nHe interrupts himself and listens. The sound of industrious sawing is heard \nthrough the silence.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tWorkmen in the forest. Oh, well! \n\t\t\t(sings)\n\t\tThe terrible night doesn't frighten me ... \n\t\t\t(speaks)\n\t\tHey, what the devil ... it's my tree they're \n\t\tcutting down.\n\nHe peers through the foliage. Below him stands a dark figure diligently \nsawing away at the base of the tree. SKAT becomes frightened and angry.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tHey, you! Do you hear me, you tricky bastard? \n\t\tWhat are you doing with my tree?\n\nThe sawing continues without a pause. SKAT becomes more frightened.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tCan't you at least answer me? Politeness costs \n\t\tso little. Who are you?\n\nDEATH straightens his back and squints up at him. SKAT cries out in terror.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI'm sawing down your tree because your time is\n\t\tup.\n<b>  \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSKAT\n</b>\t\tIt won't do. I haven't got time.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tSo you haven't got time. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tNo, I have my performance. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tThen it's canceled because of death. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tMy contract.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYour contract is terminated. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tMy children, my family. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tShame on you, Skat! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tYes, I'm ashamed.\n\nDEATH begins to saw again. The tree creaks. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tIsn't there any way to get off? Aren't there \n\t\tany special rules for actors?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tNo, not in this case. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tNo loopholes, no exceptions? \n\nDEATH saws.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT\n</b>\t\tPerhaps you'll take a bribe. \n\nDEATH saws.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSKAT\n</b>\t\tHelp!\n\nDEATH saws.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tHelp! Help!\n\nThe tree falls. The forest becomes silent again.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nNight and then dawn.\n\nThe travelers have come to a sort of clearing and have collapsed on the moss.\nThey lie quietly and listen to their own breathing, their heartbeats, and the \nwind in the tree tops. Here the forest is wild and impenetrable. Huge \nboulders stick up out of the ground like the heads of black giants. A fallen \ntree lies like a mighty barrier between light and shadow.\n\nMIA, JOF and their child have sat down apart from the others. They look at \nthe light of the moon, which is no longer full and dead but mysterious and \nunstable. The KNIGHT sits bent over his chess game. LISA cries quietly behind \nPLOG'S back. JONS lies on the ground and looks up at the heavens.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tSoon dawn will come, but the heat continues to \n\t\thang over us like a smothering blanket.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tI'm so frightened.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tWe feel that something is going to happen to \n\t\tus, but we don't know what.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tMaybe it's the day of judgment. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tThe day of judgment ...\n\nNow, something moves behind the fallen tree. There is a rustling sound and a \nmoaning cry that seems to come from a wounded animal. Everyone listens\nintently, all faces turned towards the sound. A voice comes out of the\ndarkness. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tDo you have some water?\n\nRAVAL'S perspiring face soon becomes visible. He disappears in the darkness, \nbut his voice is heard again. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tCan't you give me a little water? \n\t\t\t(pause) \n\t\tI have the plague.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDon't come here. If you do I'll slit your \n\t\tthroat. Keep to the other side of the tree. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tI'm afraid of death.\n\nNo one answers. There is complete silence. RAVAL gasps heavily for air. The \ndry leaves rustle with his movements. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tI don't want to die! I don't want to!\n<b> \n</b>No one answers. RAVAL'S face appears suddenly at the base of the tree. His \neyes bulge wildly and his mouth is ringed with foam.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tCan't you have pity on me? Help me! At least \n\t\ttalk to me.\n\nNo one answers. The trees sigh. RAVAL begins to cry. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tI am going to die. I. I. I! What will happen to \n\t\tme! Can no one console me? Haven't you any \n\t\tcompassion? Can't you see that I ...\n\nHis words are choked off by a gurgling sound. He disappears in the darkness \nbehind the fallen tree. It becomes quiet for a few moments.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\t\t(whispers) \n\t\tCan't anyone ... only a little water. \n\nSuddenly the GIRL gets up with a quick movement, snatches JONS'S water bag \nand runs a few steps. JONS grabs her and holds her fast.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tIt's no use. It's no use. I know that it's no \n\t\tuse. It's meaningless. It's totally \n\t\tmeaningless. I tell you that it's meaningless. \n\t\tCan't you hear that I'm consoling you? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tHelp me, help me!\n\nNo one answers, no one moves. RAVAL'S sobs are dry and convulsive, like a \nfrightened child's. His sudden scream is cut off in the middle. Then it \nbecomes quiet.\n<b> \n</b>The GIRL sinks down and hides her face in her hands. JONS places his hand on \nher shoulder.\n<b> \n</b>\n<b>16\n</b>The KNIGHT is no longer alone. DEATH has come to him and he raises his hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tShall we play our game to the end? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYour move!\n\nDEATH raises his hand and strikes the KNIGHT'S queen. Antonius Block looks at \n<b>DEATH. \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tNow I take your queen. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI didn't notice that.\n\nThe KNIGHT leans over the game. The moonlight moves over the chess pieces, \nwhich seem to have a life of their own.\n\nJOF has dozed off for a few moments, but suddenly he wakens. Then he sees the \nKNIGHT and DEATH together. He becomes very frightened and awakens MIA. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tMia!\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYes, what is it?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI see something terrible. Something I almost \n\t\tcan't talk about.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhat do you see?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThe knight is sitting over there playing chess. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYes, I can see that too and I don't think it's \n\t\tso terrible. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tBut do you see who he's playing with? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tHe is alone. You mustn't frighten me this way.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tNo, no, he isn't alone. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWho is it, then?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tDeath. He is sitting there playing chess with \n\t\tDeath himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYou mustn't say that. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWe must try to escape. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tOne can't do that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWe must try. They are so occupied with their \n\t\tgame that if we move very quietly, they won't \n\t\tnotice us. \n\nJOF gets up carefully and disappears into the darkness behind the trees. MIA \nremains standing, as if paralyzed by fear. She stares fixedly at the KNIGHT \nand the chess game. She holds her son in her arms. Now JOF returns.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI have harnessed the horse. The wagon is \n\t\tstanding near the big tree. You go first and \n\t\tI'll follow you with the packs. See that Mikael \n\t\tdoesn't wake up.\n\nMIA does what JOF has told her. At the same moment, the KNIGHT looks up from\nhis game. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tIt is your move, Antonius Block.\n\nThe KNIGHT remains silent. He sees MIA go through the moonlight towards the\nwagon. JOF bends down to pick up the pack and follows at a distance. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tHave you lost interest in our game?\n<b> \n</b>The KNIGHT'S eyes become alarmed. DEATH looks at him intently.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT\n</b>\t\tLost interest? On the contrary.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYou seem anxious. Are you hiding anything? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNothing escapes you -- or does it? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tNothing escapes me. No one escapes from me. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tIt's true that I'm worried.\n\nHe pretends to be clumsy and knocks the chess pieces over with the hem of his \ncoat. He looks up at DEATH. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT\n</b>\t\tI've forgotten how the pieces stood.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\t\t(laughs contentedly) \n\t\tBut I have not forgotten. You can't get away \n\t\tthat easily.\n<b> \n</b>DEATH leans over the board and rearranges the pieces. The KNIGHT looks past \nhim towards the road. MIA has just climbed up on the wagon. JOF takes the \nhorse by the bridle and leads it down the road. DEATH notices nothing; he is \ncompletely occupied with reconstructing the game.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tNow I see something interesting. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhat do you see?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYou are mated on the next move, Antonius Block. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThat's true.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tDid you enjoy your reprieve? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYes, I did.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI'm happy to hear that. Now I'll be leaving you. \n\t\tWhen we meet again, you and your companions' \n\t\ttime will be up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tAnd you will divulge your secrets. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI have no secrets. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tSo you know nothing. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI have nothing to tell.\n\nThe KNIGHT wants to answer, but DEATH is already gone.\n\nA murmur is heard in the tree tops. Dawn comes, a flickering light without \nlife, making the forest seem threatening and evil. JOF drives over the \ntwisting road. MIA sits beside him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tWhat a strange light.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI guess it's the thunderstorm which comes with \n\t\tdawn. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNo, it's something else. Something terrible. Do \n\t\tyou hear the roar in the forest? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tIt's probably rain.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNo, it isn't rain. He has seen us and he's \n\t\tfollowing us. He has overtaken us; he's coming \n\t\ttowards us. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tNot yet, Mia. In any case, not yet. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI'm so afraid. I'm so afraid.\n\nThe wagon rattles over roots and stones; it sways and creaks. Now the horse \nstops with his ears flat against his head. The forest sighs and stirs \nponderously. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tGet into the wagon, Mia. Crawl in quickly. \n\t\tWe'll lie down, Mia, with Mikael between us.\n\nThey crawl into the wagon and crouch around the sleeping child.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tIt is the Angel of Death that's passing over \n\t\tus, Mia. It's the Angel of Death. The Angel of \n\t\tDeath, and he's very big.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you feel how cold it is? I'm freezing. I'm \n\t\tterribly cold.\n\nShe shivers as if she had a fever. They pull the blankets over them and lie \nclosely together. The wagon canvas flutters and beats in the wind. The roar \noutside is like a giant bellowing.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe castle is silhouetted like a black boulder against the heavy dawn. Now\nthe storm moves there, throwing itself powerfully against walls and\nabutments.  The sky darkens; it is almost like night.\n\nAntonius Block has brought his companions with him to the castle. But it\nseems deserted. They walk from room to room. There is only emptiness and\nquiet echoes. Outside, the rain is heard roaring noisily.\n\nSuddenly the KNIGHT stands face to face with his wife. They look at each\nother quietly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN\n</b>\t\tI heard from people who came from the crusade \n\t\tthat you were on your way home. I've been \n\t\twaiting for you here. All the others have fled \n\t\tfrom the plague. \n\nThe KNIGHT is silent. He looks at her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tDon't you recognize me any more? \n\nThe KNIGHT nods, silent. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tYou also have changed.\n\nShe walks closer and looks searchingly into his face. The smile lingers in \nher eyes and she touches his hand lightly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tNow I can see that it's you. Somewhere in your \n\t\teyes, somewhere in your face, but hidden and \n\t\tfrightened, is that boy who went away so many \n\t\tyears ago. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tIt's over now and I'm a little tired. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tI see that you're tired. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tOver there stand my friends.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tAsk them in. They will break the fast with us. \n\nThey all sit down at the table in the room, which is lit by torches on the \nwalls. Silently they eat the hard bread and the salt-darkened meat. KARIN \nsits at the head of the table and reads aloud from a thick book. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\t\"And when the Lamb broke the seventh seal, \n\t\tthere was silence in heaven for about the space \n\t\tof half an hour.

KARIN interrupts her reading \nand looks up from the book. JONS rises quickly and goes to open the door.\n\n<b> \t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\t\"The first angel sounded, and there followed \n\t\thail and fire mingled with blood, and they were \n\t\tcast upon the earth; and the third part of the \n\t\ttrees was burnt up and all the green grass was \n\t\tburnt up.\"\n\nNow the rain becomes quiet. There is suddenly an immense, frightening silence \nin the large, murky room where the burning torches throw uneasy shadows over \nthe ceiling and the walls. Everyone listens tensely to the stillness.\n\n<b> \t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\t\"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a \n\t\tgreat mountain burning with fire was cast into \n\t\tthe sea; and a third part of the sea became \n\t\tblood ...\"\n\nSteps are heard on the stairs.

The wagon stands on a height above a \nslope, protected by an enormous tree. They look across ridges, forests, the \nwide plains, and the sea, which glistens in the sunlight breaking through the \nclouds.\n<b> \n</b>JOF stretches his arms and legs. MIA dries the wagon seat and sits down next\nto her husband. MIKAEL crawls between JOF'S knees.\n\nA lone bird tests its voice after the storm. The trees and bushes drip. From \nthe sea comes a strong and fragrant wind.\n\nJOF points to the dark, retreating sky where summer lightning glitters like \nsilver needles over the horizon. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI see them, Mia!

And Death, the severe master, \n\t\tinvites them to dance. He tells them to hold \n\t\teach other's hands and then they must tread the \n\t\tdance in a long row. And first goes the master \n\t\twith his scythe and hourglass, but Skat dangles \n\t\tat the end with his lyre. They dance away from \n\t\tthe dawn and it's a solemn dance towards the \n\t\tdark lands, while the rain washes their faces \n\t\tand cleans the salt of the tears from their \n\t\tcheeks. \n\nHe is silent.

I won\u2019t pretend to have\ntaken his vast measure on that first occasion, but I think I had achieved\na glimpse of what the privilege of his acquaintance might mean for many\npersons in the way of charges accepted.  He had been a great experience,\nand it was this perhaps that had put me into the frame of foreseeing how\nwe should all, sooner or later, have the honour of dealing with him as a\nwhole.  Whatever impression I then received of the amount of this total,\nI had a full enough vision of the patience of the Mulvilles.  He was to\nstay all the winter: Adelaide dropped it in a tone that drew the sting\nfrom the inevitable emphasis.  These excellent people might indeed have\nbeen content to give the circle of hospitality a diameter of six months;\nbut if they didn\u2019t say he was to stay all summer as well it was only\nbecause this was more than they ventured to hope.  I remember that at\ndinner that evening he wore slippers, new and predominantly purple, of\nsome queer carpet-stuff; but the Mulvilles were still in the stage of\nsupposing that he might be snatched from them by higher bidders.  At a\nlater time they grew, poor dears, to fear no snatching; but theirs was a\nfidelity which needed no help from competition to make them proud.\nWonderful indeed as, when all was said, you inevitably pronounced Frank\nSaltram, it was not to be overlooked that the Kent Mulvilles were in\ntheir way still more extraordinary: as striking an instance as could\neasily be encountered of the familiar truth that remarkable men find\nremarkable conveniences.\n\nThey had sent for me from Wimbledon to come out and dine, and there had\nbeen an implication in Adelaide\u2019s note\u2014judged by her notes alone she\nmight have been thought silly\u2014that it was a case in which something\nmomentous was to be determined or done.  I had never known them not be in\na \u201cstate\u201d about somebody, and I dare say I tried to be droll on this\npoint in accepting their invitation.  On finding myself in the presence\nof their latest discovery I had not at first felt irreverence droop\u2014and,\nthank heaven, I have never been absolutely deprived of that alternative\nin Mr. Saltram\u2019s company.  I saw, however\u2014I hasten to declare it\u2014that\ncompared to this specimen their other phoenixes had been birds of\ninconsiderable feather, and I afterwards took credit to myself for not\nhaving even in primal bewilderments made a mistake about the essence of\nthe man.  He had an incomparable gift; I never was blind to it\u2014it dazzles\nme still.  It dazzles me perhaps even more in remembrance than in fact,\nfor I\u2019m not unaware that for so rare a subject the imagination goes to\nsome expense, inserting a jewel here and there or giving a twist to a\nplume.  How the art of portraiture would rejoice in this figure if the\nart of portraiture had only the canvas!  Nature, in truth, had largely\nrounded it, and if memory, hovering about it, sometimes holds her breath,\nthis is because the voice that comes back was really golden.\n\nThough the great man was an inmate and didn\u2019t dress, he kept dinner on\nthis occasion waiting, and the first words he uttered on coming into the\nroom were an elated announcement to Mulville that he had found out\nsomething.  Not catching the allusion and gaping doubtless a little at\nhis face, I privately asked Adelaide what he had found out.  I shall\nnever forget the look she gave me as she replied: \u201cEverything!\u201d  She\nreally believed it.  At that moment, at any rate, he had found out that\nthe mercy of the Mulvilles was infinite.  He had previously of course\ndiscovered, as I had myself for that matter, that their dinners were\nsoign\u00e9s.  Let me not indeed, in saying this, neglect to declare that I\nshall falsify my counterfeit if I seem to hint that there was in his\nnature any ounce of calculation.  He took whatever came, but he never\nplotted for it, and no man who was so much of an absorbent can ever have\nbeen so little of a parasite.  He had a system of the universe, but he\nhad no system of sponging\u2014that was quite hand-to-mouth.  He had fine\ngross easy senses, but it was not his good-natured appetite that wrought\nconfusion.  If he had loved us for our dinners we could have paid with\nour dinners, and it would have been a great economy of finer matter.  I\nmake free in these connexions with the plural possessive because if I was\nnever able to do what the Mulvilles did, and people with still bigger\nhouses and simpler charities, I met, first and last, every demand of\nreflexion, of emotion\u2014particularly perhaps those of gratitude and of\nresentment.  No one, I think, paid the tribute of giving him up so often,\nand if it\u2019s rendering honour to borrow wisdom I\u2019ve a right to talk of my\nsacrifices.  He yielded lessons as the sea yields fish\u2014I lived for a\nwhile on this diet.  Sometimes it almost appeared to me that his massive\nmonstrous failure\u2014if failure after all it was\u2014had been designed for my\nprivate recreation.  He fairly pampered my curiosity; but the history of\nthat experience would take me too far.  This is not the large canvas I\njust now spoke of, and I wouldn\u2019t have approached him with my present\nhand had it been a question of all the features.  Frank Saltram\u2019s\nfeatures, for artistic purposes, are verily the anecdotes that are to be\ngathered.  Their name is legion, and this is only one, of which the\ninterest is that it concerns even more closely several other persons.\nSuch episodes, as one looks back, are the little dramas that made up the\ninnumerable facets of the big drama\u2014which is yet to be reported.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nIT is furthermore remarkable that though the two stories are distinct\u2014my\nown, as it were, and this other\u2014they equally began, in a manner, the\nfirst night of my acquaintance with Frank Saltram, the night I came back\nfrom Wimbledon so agitated with a new sense of life that, in London, for\nthe very thrill of it, I could only walk home.  Walking and swinging my\nstick, I overtook, at Buckingham Gate, George Gravener, and George\nGravener\u2019s story may be said to have begun with my making him, as our\npaths lay together, come home with me for a talk.  I duly remember, let\nme parenthesise, that it was still more that of another person, and also\nthat several years were to elapse before it was to extend to a second\nchapter.  I had much to say to him, none the less, about my visit to the\nMulvilles, whom he more indifferently knew, and I was at any rate so\namusing that for long afterwards he never encountered me without asking\nfor news of the old man of the sea.  I hadn\u2019t said Mr. Saltram was old,\nand it was to be seen that he was of an age to outweather George\nGravener.  I had at that time a lodging in Ebury Street, and Gravener was\nstaying at his brother\u2019s empty house in Eaton Square.  At Cambridge, five\nyears before, even in our devastating set, his intellectual power had\nseemed to me almost awful.  Some one had once asked me privately, with\nblanched cheeks, what it was then that after all such a mind as that left\nstanding.  \u201cIt leaves itself!\u201d I could recollect devoutly replying.  I\ncould smile at present for this remembrance, since before we got to Ebury\nStreet I was struck with the fact that, save in the sense of being well\nset up on his legs, George Gravener had actually ceased to tower.  The\nuniverse he laid low had somehow bloomed again\u2014the usual eminences were\nvisible.  I wondered whether he had lost his humour, or only, dreadful\nthought, had never had any\u2014not even when I had fancied him most\nAristophanesque.  What was the need of appealing to laughter, however, I\ncould enviously enquire, where you might appeal so confidently to\nmeasurement?  Mr. Saltram\u2019s queer figure, his thick nose and hanging lip,\nwere fresh to me: in the light of my old friend\u2019s fine cold symmetry they\npresented mere success in amusing as the refuge of conscious ugliness.\nAlready, at hungry twenty-six, Gravener looked as blank and parliamentary\nas if he were fifty and popular.  In my scrap of a residence\u2014he had a\nworldling\u2019s eye for its futile conveniences, but never a comrade\u2019s joke\u2014I\nsounded Frank Saltram in his ears; a circumstance I mention in order to\nnote that even then I was surprised at his impatience of my enlivenment.\nAs he had never before heard of the personage it took indeed the form of\nimpatience of the preposterous Mulvilles, his relation to whom, like\nmine, had had its origin in an early, a childish intimacy with the young\nAdelaide, the fruit of multiplied ties in the previous generation.  When\nshe married Kent Mulville, who was older than Gravener and I and much\nmore amiable, I gained a friend, but Gravener practically lost one.  We\nreacted in different ways from the form taken by what he called their\ndeplorable social action\u2014the form (the term was also his) of nasty\nsecond-rate gush.  I may have held in my \u2018for int\u00e9rieur\u2019 that the good\npeople at Wimbledon were beautiful fools, but when he sniffed at them I\ncouldn\u2019t help taking the opposite line, for I already felt that even\nshould we happen to agree it would always be for reasons that differed.\nIt came home to me that he was admirably British as, without so much as a\nsociable sneer at my bookbinder, he turned away from the serried rows of\nmy little French library.\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ve never seen the fellow, but it\u2019s clear enough he\u2019s a\nhumbug.\u201d\n\n\u201cClear \u2018enough\u2019 is just what it isn\u2019t,\u201d I replied; \u201cif it only were!\u201d\nThat ejaculation on my part must have been the beginning of what was to\nbe later a long ache for final frivolous rest.  Gravener was profound\nenough to remark after a moment that in the first place he couldn\u2019t be\nanything but a Dissenter, and when I answered that the very note of his\nfascination was his extraordinary speculative breadth my friend retorted\nthat there was no cad like your cultivated cad, and that I might depend\nupon discovering\u2014since I had had the levity not already to have\nenquired\u2014that my shining light proceeded, a generation back, from a\nMethodist cheesemonger.  I confess I was struck with his insistence, and\nI said, after reflexion: \u201cIt may be\u2014I admit it may be; but why on earth\nare you so sure?\u201d\u2014asking the question mainly to lay him the trap of\nsaying that it was because the poor man didn\u2019t dress for dinner.  He took\nan instant to circumvent my trap and come blandly out the other side.\n\n\u201cBecause the Kent Mulvilles have invented him.  They\u2019ve an infallible\nhand for frauds.  All their geese are swans.  They were born to be duped,\nthey like it, they cry for it, they don\u2019t know anything from anything,\nand they disgust one\u2014luckily perhaps!\u2014with Christian charity.\u201d  His\nvehemence was doubtless an accident, but it might have been a strange\nforeknowledge.  I forget what protest I dropped; it was at any rate\nsomething that led him to go on after a moment: \u201cI only ask one\nthing\u2014it\u2019s perfectly simple.  Is a man, in a given case, a real\ngentleman?\u201d\n\n\u201cA real gentleman, my dear fellow\u2014that\u2019s so soon said!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot so soon when he isn\u2019t!  If they\u2019ve got hold of one this time he must\nbe a great rascal!\u201d\n\n\u201cI might feel injured,\u201d I answered, \u201cif I didn\u2019t reflect that they don\u2019t\nrave about me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be too sure!  I\u2019ll grant that he\u2019s a gentleman,\u201d Gravener\npresently added, \u201cif you\u2019ll admit that he\u2019s a scamp.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know which to admire most, your logic or your benevolence.\u201d\n\nMy friend coloured at this, but he didn\u2019t change the subject.  \u201cWhere did\nthey pick him up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they were struck with something he had published.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can fancy the dreary thing!\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe they found out he had all sorts of worries and difficulties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat of course wasn\u2019t to be endured, so they jumped at the privilege of\npaying his debts!\u201d  I professed that I knew nothing about his debts, and\nI reminded my visitor that though the dear Mulvilles were angels they\nwere neither idiots nor millionaires.  What they mainly aimed at was\nreuniting Mr. Saltram to his wife.  \u201cI was expecting to hear he has\nbasely abandoned her,\u201d Gravener went on, at this, \u201cand I\u2019m too glad you\ndon\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d\n\nI tried to recall exactly what Mrs. Mulville had told me.  \u201cHe didn\u2019t\nleave her\u2014no.  It\u2019s she who has left him.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeft him to us?\u201d Gravener asked.  \u201cThe monster\u2014many thanks!  I decline\nto take him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hear more about him in spite of yourself.  I can\u2019t, no, I really\ncan\u2019t resist the impression that he\u2019s a big man.\u201d  I was already\nmastering\u2014to my shame perhaps be it said\u2014just the tone my old friend\nleast liked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s doubtless only a trifle,\u201d he returned, \u201cbut you haven\u2019t happened to\nmention what his reputation\u2019s to rest on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy on what I began by boring you with\u2014his extraordinary mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs exhibited in his writings?\u201d\n\n\u201cPossibly in his writings, but certainly in his talk, which is far and\naway the richest I ever listened to.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s it all about?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow, don\u2019t ask me!  About everything!\u201d I pursued, reminding\nmyself of poor Adelaide.  \u201cAbout his ideas of things,\u201d I then more\ncharitably added.  \u201cYou must have heard him to know what I mean\u2014it\u2019s\nunlike anything that ever was heard.\u201d  I coloured, I admit, I overcharged\na little, for such a picture was an anticipation of Saltram\u2019s later\ndevelopment and still more of my fuller acquaintance with him.  However,\nI really expressed, a little lyrically perhaps, my actual imagination of\nhim when I proceeded to declare that, in a cloud of tradition, of legend,\nhe might very well go down to posterity as the greatest of all great\ntalkers.  Before we parted George Gravener had wondered why such a row\nshould be made about a chatterbox the more and why he should be pampered\nand pensioned.  The greater the wind-bag the greater the calamity.  Out\nof proportion to everything else on earth had come to be this wagging of\nthe tongue.  We were drenched with talk\u2014our wretched age was dying of it.\nI differed from him here sincerely, only going so far as to concede, and\ngladly, that we were drenched with sound.  It was not however the mere\nspeakers who were killing us\u2014it was the mere stammerers.  Fine talk was\nas rare as it was refreshing\u2014the gift of the gods themselves, the one\nstarry spangle on the ragged cloak of humanity.  How many men were there\nwho rose to this privilege, of how many masters of conversation could he\nboast the acquaintance?  Dying of talk?\u2014why we were dying of the lack of\nit!  Bad writing wasn\u2019t talk, as many people seemed to think, and even\ngood wasn\u2019t always to be compared to it.  From the best talk indeed the\nbest writing had something to learn.  I fancifully added that we too\nshould peradventure be gilded by the legend, should be pointed at for\nhaving listened, for having actually heard.  Gravener, who had glanced at\nhis watch and discovered it was midnight, found to all this a retort\nbeautifully characteristic of him.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one little fact to be borne in mind in the presence equally of\nthe best talk and of the worst.\u201d  He looked, in saying this, as if he\nmeant great things, and I was sure he could only mean once more that\nneither of them mattered if a man wasn\u2019t a real gentleman.  Perhaps it\nwas what he did mean; he deprived me however of the exultation of being\nright by putting the truth in a slightly different way.  \u201cThe only thing\nthat really counts for one\u2019s estimate of a person is his conduct.\u201d  He\nhad his watch still in his palm, and I reproached him with unfair play in\nhaving ascertained beforehand that it was now the hour at which I always\ngave in.  My pleasantry so far failed to mollify him that he promptly\nadded that to the rule he had just enunciated there was absolutely no\nexception.\n\n\u201cNone whatever?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me then to try to be good at any price!\u201d I laughed as I went with\nhim to the door.  \u201cI declare I will be, if I have to be horrible!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIF that first night was one of the liveliest, or at any rate was the\nfreshest, of my exaltations, there was another, four years later, that\nwas one of my great discomposures.  Repetition, I well knew by this time,\nwas the secret of Saltram\u2019s power to alienate, and of course one would\nnever have seen him at his finest if one hadn\u2019t seen him in his remorses.\nThey set in mainly at this season and were magnificent, elemental,\norchestral.  I was quite aware that one of these atmospheric disturbances\nwas now due; but none the less, in our arduous attempt to set him on his\nfeet as a lecturer, it was impossible not to feel that two failures were\na large order, as we said, for a short course of five.  This was the\nsecond time, and it was past nine o\u2019clock; the audience, a muster\nunprecedented and really encouraging, had fortunately the attitude of\nblandness that might have been looked for in persons whom the promise of\n(if I\u2019m not mistaken) An Analysis of Primary Ideas had drawn to the\nneighbourhood of Upper Baker Street.  There was in those days in that\nregion a petty lecture-hall to be secured on terms as moderate as the\nfunds left at our disposal by the irrepressible question of the\nmaintenance of five small Saltrams\u2014I include the mother\u2014and one large\none.  By the time the Saltrams, of different sizes, were all maintained\nwe had pretty well poured out the oil that might have lubricated the\nmachinery for enabling the most original of men to appear to maintain\nthem.\n\nIt was I, the other time, who had been forced into the breach, standing\nup there for an odious lamplit moment to explain to half a dozen thin\nbenches, where earnest brows were virtuously void of anything so cynical\nas a suspicion, that we couldn\u2019t so much as put a finger on Mr. Saltram.\nThere was nothing to plead but that our scouts had been out from the\nearly hours and that we were afraid that on one of his walks abroad\u2014he\ntook one, for meditation, whenever he was to address such a company\u2014some\naccident had disabled or delayed him.  The meditative walks were a\nfiction, for he never, that any one could discover, prepared anything but\na magnificent prospectus; hence his circulars and programmes, of which I\npossess an almost complete collection, are the solemn ghosts of\ngenerations never born.  I put the case, as it seemed to me, at the best;\nbut I admit I had been angry, and Kent Mulville was shocked at my want of\npublic optimism.  This time therefore I left the excuses to his more\npractised patience, only relieving myself in response to a direct appeal\nfrom a young lady next whom, in the hall, I found myself sitting.  My\nposition was an accident, but if it had been calculated the reason would\nscarce have eluded an observer of the fact that no one else in the room\nhad an approach to an appearance.  Our philosopher\u2019s \u201ctail\u201d was\ndeplorably limp.  This visitor was the only person who looked at her\nease, who had come a little in the spirit of adventure.  She seemed to\ncarry amusement in her handsome young head, and her presence spoke, a\nlittle mystifyingly, of a sudden extension of Saltram\u2019s sphere of\ninfluence.  He was doing better than we hoped, and he had chosen such an\noccasion, of all occasions, to succumb to heaven knew which of his fond\ninfirmities.  The young lady produced an impression of auburn hair and\nblack velvet, and had on her other hand a companion of obscurer type,\npresumably a waiting-maid.  She herself might perhaps have been a foreign\ncountess, and before she addressed me I had beguiled our sorry interval\nby finding in her a vague recall of the opening of some novel of Madame\nSand.  It didn\u2019t make her more fathomable to pass in a few minutes from\nthis to the certitude that she was American; it simply engendered\ndepressing reflexions as to the possible check to contributions from\nBoston.  She asked me if, as a person apparently more initiated, I would\nrecommend further waiting, and I answered that if she considered I was on\nmy honour I would privately deprecate it.  Perhaps she didn\u2019t; at any\nrate our talk took a turn that prolonged it till she became aware we were\nleft almost alone.  I presently ascertained she knew Mrs. Saltram, and\nthis explained in a manner the miracle.  The brotherhood of the friends\nof the husband was as nothing to the brotherhood, or perhaps I should say\nthe sisterhood, of the friends of the wife.  Like the Kent Mulvilles I\nbelonged to both fraternities, and even better than they I think I had\nsounded the abyss of Mrs. Saltram\u2019s wrongs.  She bored me to extinction,\nand I knew but too well how she had bored her husband; but there were\nthose who stood by her, the most efficient of whom were indeed the\nhandful of poor Saltram\u2019s backers.  They did her liberal justice, whereas\nher mere patrons and partisans had nothing but hatred for our\nphilosopher.  I\u2019m bound to say it was we, however\u2014we of both camps, as it\nwere\u2014who had always done most for her.\n\nI thought my young lady looked rich\u2014I scarcely knew why; and I hoped she\nhad put her hand in her pocket.  I soon made her out, however, not at all\na fine fanatic\u2014she was but a generous, irresponsible enquirer.  She had\ncome to England to see her aunt, and it was at her aunt\u2019s she had met the\ndreary lady we had all so much on our mind.  I saw she\u2019d help to pass the\ntime when she observed that it was a pity this lady wasn\u2019t intrinsically\nmore interesting.  That was refreshing, for it was an article of faith in\nMrs. Saltram\u2019s circle\u2014at least among those who scorned to know her horrid\nhusband\u2014that she was attractive on her merits.  She was in truth a most\nordinary person, as Saltram himself would have been if he hadn\u2019t been a\nprodigy.  The question of vulgarity had no application to him, but it was\na measure his wife kept challenging you to apply.  I hasten to add that\nthe consequences of your doing so were no sufficient reason for his\nhaving left her to starve.  \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to have much force of\ncharacter,\u201d said my young lady; at which I laughed out so loud that my\ndeparting friends looked back at me over their shoulders as if I were\nmaking a joke of their discomfiture.  My joke probably cost Saltram a\nsubscription or two, but it helped me on with my interlocutress.  \u201cShe\nsays he drinks like a fish,\u201d she sociably continued, \u201cand yet she allows\nthat his mind\u2019s wonderfully clear.\u201d  It was amusing to converse with a\npretty girl who could talk of the clearness of Saltram\u2019s mind.  I\nexpected next to hear she had been assured he was awfully clever.  I\ntried to tell her\u2014I had it almost on my conscience\u2014what was the proper\nway to regard him; an effort attended perhaps more than ever on this\noccasion with the usual effect of my feeling that I wasn\u2019t after all very\nsure of it.  She had come to-night out of high curiosity\u2014she had wanted\nto learn this proper way for herself.  She had read some of his papers\nand hadn\u2019t understood them; but it was at home, at her aunt\u2019s, that her\ncuriosity had been kindled\u2014kindled mainly by his wife\u2019s remarkable\nstories of his want of virtue.  \u201cI suppose they ought to have kept me\naway,\u201d my companion dropped, \u201cand I suppose they\u2019d have done so if I\nhadn\u2019t somehow got an idea that he\u2019s fascinating.  In fact Mrs. Saltram\nherself says he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you came to see where the fascination resides?  Well, you\u2019ve seen!\u201d\n\nMy young lady raised fine eyebrows.  \u201cDo you mean in his bad faith?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the extraordinary effects of it; his possession, that is, of some\nquality or other that condemns us in advance to forgive him the\nhumiliation, as I may call it, to which he has subjected us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe humiliation?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy mine, for instance, as one of his guarantors, before you as the\npurchaser of a ticket.\u201d\n\nShe let her charming gay eyes rest on me.  \u201cYou don\u2019t look humiliated a\nbit, and if you did I should let you off, disappointed as I am; for the\nmysterious quality you speak of is just the quality I came to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you can\u2019t \u2018see\u2019 it!\u201d I cried.\n\n\u201cHow then do you get at it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t!  You mustn\u2019t suppose he\u2019s good-looking,\u201d I added.\n\n\u201cWhy his wife says he\u2019s lovely!\u201d\n\nMy hilarity may have struck her as excessive, but I confess it broke out\nafresh.  Had she acted only in obedience to this singular plea, so\ncharacteristic, on Mrs. Saltram\u2019s part, of what was irritating in the\nnarrowness of that lady\u2019s point of view?  \u201cMrs. Saltram,\u201d I explained,\n\u201cundervalues him where he\u2019s strongest, so that, to make up for it\nperhaps, she overpraises him where he\u2019s weak.  He\u2019s not, assuredly,\nsuperficially attractive; he\u2019s middle-aged, fat, featureless save for his\ngreat eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, his great eyes,\u201d said my young lady attentively.  She had evidently\nheard all about his great eyes\u2014the beaux yeux for which alone we had\nreally done it all.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tragic and splendid\u2014lights on a dangerous coast.  But he moves\nbadly and dresses worse, and altogether he\u2019s anything but smart.\u201d\n\nMy companion, who appeared to reflect on this, after a moment appealed.\n\u201cDo you call him a real gentleman?\u201d\n\nI started slightly at the question, for I had a sense of recognising it:\nGeorge Gravener, years before, that first flushed night, had put me face\nto face with it.  It had embarrassed me then, but it didn\u2019t embarrass me\nnow, for I had lived with it and overcome it and disposed of it.  \u201cA real\ngentleman?  Emphatically not!\u201d\n\nMy promptitude surprised her a little, but I quickly felt how little it\nwas to Gravener I was now talking.  \u201cDo you say that because he\u2019s\u2014what do\nyou call it in England?\u2014of humble extraction?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a bit.  His father was a country school-master and his mother the\nwidow of a sexton, but that has nothing to do with it.  I say it simply\nbecause I know him well.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t it an awful drawback?\u201d\n\n\u201cAwful\u2014quite awful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean isn\u2019t it positively fatal?\u201d\n\n\u201cFatal to what?  Not to his magnificent vitality.\u201d\n\nAgain she had a meditative moment.  \u201cAnd is his magnificent vitality the\ncause of his vices?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour questions are formidable, but I\u2019m glad you put them.  I was\nthinking of his noble intellect.  His vices, as you say, have been much\nexaggerated: they consist mainly after all in one comprehensive defect.\u201d\n\n\u201cA want of will?\u201d\n\n\u201cA want of dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t recognise his obligations?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, he recognises them with effusion, especially in public:\nhe smiles and bows and beckons across the street to them.  But when they\npass over he turns away, and he speedily loses them in the crowd.  The\nrecognition\u2019s purely spiritual\u2014it isn\u2019t in the least social.  So he\nleaves all his belongings to other people to take care of.  He accepts\nfavours, loans, sacrifices\u2014all with nothing more deterrent than an agony\nof shame.  Fortunately we\u2019re a little faithful band, and we do what we\ncan.\u201d  I held my tongue about the natural children, engendered, to the\nnumber of three, in the wantonness of his youth.  I only remarked that he\ndid make efforts\u2014often tremendous ones.  \u201cBut the efforts,\u201d I said,\n\u201cnever come to much: the only things that come to much are the\nabandonments, the surrenders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how much do they come to?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right to put it as if we had a big bill to pay, but, as I\u2019ve told\nyou before, your questions are rather terrible.  They come, these mere\nexercises of genius, to a great sum total of poetry, of philosophy, a\nmighty mass of speculation, notation, quotation.  The genius is there,\nyou see, to meet the surrender; but there\u2019s no genius to support the\ndefence.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what is there, after all, at his age, to show?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the way of achievement recognised and reputation established?\u201d I\nasked.  \u201cTo \u2018show\u2019 if you will, there isn\u2019t much, since his writing,\nmostly, isn\u2019t as fine, isn\u2019t certainly as showy, as his talk.  Moreover\ntwo-thirds of his work are merely colossal projects and announcements.\n\u2018Showing\u2019 Frank Saltram is often a poor business,\u201d I went on: \u201cwe\nendeavoured, you\u2019ll have observed, to show him to-night!  However, if he\nhad lectured he\u2019d have lectured divinely.  It would just have been his\ntalk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what would his talk just have been?\u201d\n\nI was conscious of some ineffectiveness, as well perhaps as of a little\nimpatience, as I replied: \u201cThe exhibition of a splendid intellect.\u201d  My\nyoung lady looked not quite satisfied at this, but as I wasn\u2019t prepared\nfor another question I hastily pursued: \u201cThe sight of a great suspended\nswinging crystal\u2014huge lucid lustrous, a block of light\u2014flashing back\nevery impression of life and every possibility of thought!\u201d\n\nThis gave her something to turn over till we had passed out to the dusky\nporch of the hall, in front of which the lamps of a quiet brougham were\nalmost the only thing Saltram\u2019s treachery hadn\u2019t extinguished.  I went\nwith her to the door of her carriage, out of which she leaned a moment\nafter she had thanked me and taken her seat.  Her smile even in the\ndarkness was pretty.  \u201cI do want to see that crystal!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve only to come to the next lecture.\u201d\n\n\u201cI go abroad in a day or two with my aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait over till next week,\u201d I suggested.  \u201cIt\u2019s quite worth it.\u201d\n\nShe became grave.  \u201cNot unless he really comes!\u201d  At which the brougham\nstarted off, carrying her away too fast, fortunately for my manners, to\nallow me to exclaim \u201cIngratitude!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM made a great affair of her right to be informed where her\nhusband had been the second evening he failed to meet his audience.  She\ncame to me to ascertain, but I couldn\u2019t satisfy her, for in spite of my\ningenuity I remained in ignorance.  It wasn\u2019t till much later that I\nfound this had not been the case with Kent Mulville, whose hope for the\nbest never twirled the thumbs of him more placidly than when he happened\nto know the worst.  He had known it on the occasion I speak of\u2014that is\nimmediately after.  He was impenetrable then, but ultimately confessed.\nWhat he confessed was more than I shall now venture to make public.  It\nwas of course familiar to me that Saltram was incapable of keeping the\nengagements which, after their separation, he had entered into with\nregard to his wife, a deeply wronged, justly resentful, quite\nirreproachable and insufferable person.  She often appeared at my\nchambers to talk over his lapses; for if, as she declared, she had washed\nher hands of him, she had carefully preserved the water of this ablution,\nwhich she handed about for analysis.  She had arts of her own of exciting\none\u2019s impatience, the most infallible of which was perhaps her assumption\nthat we were kind to her because we liked her.  In reality her personal\nfall had been a sort of social rise\u2014since I had seen the moment when, in\nour little conscientious circle, her desolation almost made her the\nfashion.  Her voice was grating and her children ugly; moreover she hated\nthe good Mulvilles, whom I more and more loved.  They were the people who\nby doing most for her husband had in the long run done most for herself;\nand the warm confidence with which he had laid his length upon them was a\npressure gentle compared with her stiffer persuadability.  I\u2019m bound to\nsay he didn\u2019t criticise his benefactors, though practically he got tired\nof them; she, however, had the highest standards about eleemosynary\nforms.  She offered the odd spectacle of a spirit puffed up by\ndependence, and indeed it had introduced her to some excellent society.\nShe pitied me for not knowing certain people who aided her and whom she\ndoubtless patronised in turn for their luck in not knowing me.  I dare\nsay I should have got on with her better if she had had a ray of\nimagination\u2014if it had occasionally seemed to occur to her to regard\nSaltram\u2019s expressions of his nature in any other manner than as separate\nsubjects of woe.  They were all flowers of his character, pearls strung\non an endless thread; but she had a stubborn little way of challenging\nthem one after the other, as if she never suspected that he had a\ncharacter, such as it was, or that deficiencies might be organic; the\nirritating effect of a mind incapable of a generalisation.  One might\ndoubtless have overdone the idea that there was a general licence for\nsuch a man; but if this had happened it would have been through one\u2019s\nfeeling that there could be none for such a woman.\n\nI recognised her superiority when I asked her about the aunt of the\ndisappointed young lady: it sounded like a sentence from an\nEnglish-French or other phrase-book.  She triumphed in what she told me\nand she may have triumphed still more in what she withheld.  My friend of\nthe other evening, Miss Anvoy, had but lately come to England; Lady\nCoxon, the aunt, had been established here for years in consequence of\nher marriage with the late Sir Gregory of that name.  She had a house in\nthe Regent\u2019s Park, a Bath-chair and a fernery; and above all she had\nsympathy.  Mrs. Saltram had made her acquaintance through mutual friends.\nThis vagueness caused me to feel how much I was out of it and how large\nan independent circle Mrs. Saltram had at her command.  I should have\nbeen glad to know more about the disappointed young lady, but I felt I\nshould know most by not depriving her of her advantage, as she might have\nmysterious means of depriving me of my knowledge.  For the present,\nmoreover, this experience was stayed, Lady Coxon having in fact gone\nabroad accompanied by her niece.  The niece, besides being immensely\nclever, was an heiress, Mrs. Saltram said; the only daughter and the\nlight of the eyes of some great American merchant, a man, over there, of\nendless indulgences and dollars.  She had pretty clothes and pretty\nmanners, and she had, what was prettier still, the great thing of all.\nThe great thing of all for Mrs. Saltram was always sympathy, and she\nspoke as if during the absence of these ladies she mightn\u2019t know where to\nturn for it.  A few months later indeed, when they had come back, her\ntone perceptibly changed: she alluded to them, on my leading her up to\nit, rather as to persons in her debt for favours received.  What had\nhappened I didn\u2019t know, but I saw it would take only a little more or a\nlittle less to make her speak of them as thankless subjects of social\ncountenance\u2014people for whom she had vainly tried to do something.  I\nconfess I saw how it wouldn\u2019t be in a mere week or two that I should rid\nmyself of the image of Ruth Anvoy, in whose very name, when I learnt it,\nI found something secretly to like.  I should probably neither see her\nnor hear of her again: the knight\u2019s widow (he had been mayor of\nClockborough) would pass away and the heiress would return to her\ninheritance.  I gathered with surprise that she had not communicated to\nhis wife the story of her attempt to hear Mr..Saltram, and I founded this\nreticence on the easy supposition that Mrs. Saltram had fatigued by\noverpressure the spring of the sympathy of which she boasted.  The girl\nat any rate would forget the small adventure, be distracted, take a\nhusband; besides which she would lack occasion to repeat her experiment.\n\nWe clung to the idea of the brilliant course, delivered without an\naccident, that, as a lecturer, would still make the paying public aware\nof our great man, but the fact remained that in the case of an\ninspiration so unequal there was treachery, there was fallacy at least,\nin the very conception of a series.  In our scrutiny of ways and means we\nwere inevitably subject to the old convention of the synopsis, the\nsyllabus, partly of course not to lose the advantage of his grand free\nhand in drawing up such things; but for myself I laughed at our playbills\neven while I stickled for them.  It was indeed amusing work to be\nscrupulous for Frank Saltram, who also at moments laughed about it, so\nfar as the comfort of a sigh so unstudied as to be cheerful might pass\nfor such a sound.  He admitted with a candour all his own that he was in\ntruth only to be depended on in the Mulvilles\u2019 drawing-room.  \u201cYes,\u201d he\nsuggestively allowed, \u201cit\u2019s there, I think, that I\u2019m at my best; quite\nlate, when it gets toward eleven\u2014and if I\u2019ve not been too much worried.\u201d\nWe all knew what too much worry meant; it meant too enslaved for the hour\nto the superstition of sobriety.  On the Saturdays I used to bring my\nportmanteau, so as not to have to think of eleven o\u2019clock trains.  I had\na bold theory that as regards this temple of talk and its altars of\ncushioned chintz, its pictures and its flowers, its large fireside and\nclear lamplight, we might really arrive at something if the Mulvilles\nwould but charge for admission.  Here it was, however, that they\nshamelessly broke down; as there\u2019s a flaw in every perfection this was\nthe inexpugnable refuge of their egotism.  They declined to make their\nsaloon a market, so that Saltram\u2019s golden words continued the sole coin\nthat rang there.  It can have happened to no man, however, to be paid a\ngreater price than such an enchanted hush as surrounded him on his\ngreatest nights.  The most profane, on these occasions, felt a presence;\nall minor eloquence grew dumb.  Adelaide Mulville, for the pride of her\nhospitality, anxiously watched the door or stealthily poked the fire.  I\nused to call it the music-room, for we had anticipated Bayreuth.  The\nvery gates of the kingdom of light seemed to open and the horizon of\nthought to flash with the beauty of a sunrise at sea.\n\nIn the consideration of ways and means, the sittings of our little board,\nwe were always conscious of the creak of Mrs. Saltram\u2019s shoes.  She\nhovered, she interrupted, she almost presided, the state of affairs being\nmostly such as to supply her with every incentive for enquiring what was\nto be done next.  It was the pressing pursuit of this knowledge that, in\nconcatenations of omnibuses and usually in very wet weather, led her so\noften to my door.  She thought us spiritless creatures with editors and\npublishers; but she carried matters to no great effect when she\npersonally pushed into back-shops.  She wanted all moneys to be paid to\nherself: they were otherwise liable to such strange adventures.  They\ntrickled away into the desert\u2014they were mainly at best, alas, a slender\nstream.  The editors and the publishers were the last people to take this\nremarkable thinker at the valuation that has now pretty well come to be\nestablished.  The former were half-distraught between the desire to \u201ccut\u201d\nhim and the difficulty of finding a crevice for their shears; and when a\nvolume on this or that portentous subject was proposed to the latter they\nsuggested alternative titles which, as reported to our friend, brought\ninto his face the noble blank melancholy that sometimes made it handsome.\nThe title of an unwritten book didn\u2019t after all much matter, but some\nmasterpiece of Saltram\u2019s may have died in his bosom of the shudder with\nwhich it was then convulsed.  The ideal solution, failing the fee at Kent\nMulville\u2019s door, would have been some system of subscription to projected\ntreatises with their non-appearance provided for\u2014provided for, I mean, by\nthe indulgence of subscribers.  The author\u2019s real misfortune was that\nsubscribers were so wretchedly literal.  When they tastelessly enquired\nwhy publication hadn\u2019t ensued I was tempted to ask who in the world had\never been so published.  Nature herself had brought him out in voluminous\nform, and the money was simply a deposit on borrowing the work.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nI WAS doubtless often a nuisance to my friends in those years; but there\nwere sacrifices I declined to make, and I never passed the hat to George\nGravener.  I never forgot our little discussion in Ebury Street, and I\nthink it stuck in my throat to have to treat him to the avowal I had\nfound so easy to Mss Anvoy.  It had cost me nothing to confide to this\ncharming girl, but it would have cost me much to confide to the friend of\nmy youth, that the character of the \u201creal gentleman\u201d wasn\u2019t an attribute\nof the man I took such pains for.  Was this because I had already\ngeneralised to the point of perceiving that women are really the\nunfastidious sex?  I knew at any rate that Gravener, already quite in\nview but still hungry and frugal, had naturally enough more ambition than\ncharity.  He had sharp aims for stray sovereigns, being in view most from\nthe tall steeple of Clockborough.  His immediate ambition was to occupy \u00e0\nlui seul the field of vision of that smokily-seeing city, and all his\nmovements and postures were calculated for the favouring angle.  The\nmovement of the hand as to the pocket had thus to alternate gracefully\nwith the posture of the hand on the heart.  He talked to Clockborough in\nshort only less beguilingly than Frank Saltram talked to his electors;\nwith the difference to our credit, however, that we had already voted and\nthat our candidate had no antagonist but himself.  He had more than once\nbeen at Wimbledon\u2014it was Mrs. Mulville\u2019s work not mine\u2014and by the time\nthe claret was served had seen the god descend.  He took more pains to\nswing his censer than I had expected, but on our way back to town he\nforestalled any little triumph I might have been so artless as to express\nby the observation that such a man was\u2014a hundred times!\u2014a man to use and\nnever a man to be used by.  I remember that this neat remark humiliated\nme almost as much as if virtually, in the fever of broken slumbers, I\nhadn\u2019t often made it myself.  The difference was that on Gravener\u2019s part\na force attached to it that could never attach to it on mine.  He was\nable to use people\u2014he had the machinery; and the irony of Saltram\u2019s being\nmade showy at Clockborough came out to me when he said, as if he had no\nmemory of our original talk and the idea were quite fresh to him: \u201cI hate\nhis type, you know, but I\u2019ll be hanged if I don\u2019t put some of those\nthings in.  I can find a place for them: we might even find a place for\nthe fellow himself.\u201d  I myself should have had some fear\u2014not, I need\nscarcely say, for the \u201cthings\u201d themselves, but for some other things very\nnear them; in fine for the rest of my eloquence.\n\nLater on I could see that the oracle of Wimbledon was not in this case so\nappropriate as he would have been had the polities of the gods only\ncoincided more exactly with those of the party.  There was a distinct\nmoment when, without saying anything more definite to me, Gravener\nentertained the idea of annexing Mr. Saltram.  Such a project was\ndelusive, for the discovery of analogies between his body of doctrine and\nthat pressed from headquarters upon Clockborough\u2014the bottling, in a word,\nof the air of those lungs for convenient public uncorking in\ncorn-exchanges\u2014was an experiment for which no one had the leisure.  The\nonly thing would have been to carry him massively about, paid, caged,\nclipped; to turn him on for a particular occasion in a particular\nchannel.  Frank Saltram\u2019s channel, however, was essentially not\ncalculable, and there was no knowing what disastrous floods might have\nensued.  For what there would have been to do The Empire, the great\nnewspaper, was there to look to; but it was no new misfortune that there\nwere delicate situations in which The Empire broke down.  In fine there\nwas an instinctive apprehension that a clever young journalist\ncommissioned to report on Mr. Saltram might never come back from the\nerrand.  No one knew better than George Gravener that that was a time\nwhen prompt returns counted double.  If he therefore found our friend an\nexasperating waste of orthodoxy it was because of his being, as he said,\npoor Gravener, up in the clouds, not because he was down in the dust.\nThe man would have been, just as he was, a real enough gentleman if he\ncould have helped to put in a real gentleman.  Gravener\u2019s great objection\nto the actual member was that he was not one.\n\nLady Coxon had a fine old house, a house with \u201cgrounds,\u201d at Clockborough,\nwhich she had let; but after she returned from abroad I learned from Mrs.\nSaltram that the lease had fallen in and that she had gone down to resume\npossession.  I could see the faded red livery, the big square shoulders,\nthe high-walled garden of this decent abode.  As the rumble of\ndissolution grew louder the suitor would have pressed his suit, and I\nfound myself hoping the politics of the late Mayor\u2019s widow wouldn\u2019t be\nsuch as to admonish her to ask him to dinner; perhaps indeed I went so\nfar as to pray, they would naturally form a bar to any contact.  I tried\nto focus the many-buttoned page, in the daily airing, as he perhaps even\npushed the Bath-chair over somebody\u2019s toes.  I was destined to hear, none\nthe less, through Mrs. Saltram\u2014who, I afterwards learned, was in\ncorrespondence with Lady Coxon\u2019s housekeeper\u2014that Gravener was known to\nhave spoken of the habitation I had in my eye as the pleasantest thing at\nClockborough.  On his part, I was sure, this was the voice not of envy\nbut of experience.  The vivid scene was now peopled, and I could see him\nin the old-time garden with Miss Anvoy, who would be certain, and very\njustly, to think him good-looking.  It would be too much to describe\nmyself as troubled by this play of surmise; but I occur to remember the\nrelief, singular enough, of feeling it suddenly brushed away by an\nannoyance really much greater; an annoyance the result of its happening\nto come over me about that time with a rush that I was simply ashamed of\nFrank Saltram.  There were limits after all, and my mark at last had been\nreached.\n\nI had had my disgusts, if I may allow myself to-day such an expression;\nbut this was a supreme revolt.  Certain things cleared up in my mind,\ncertain values stood out.  It was all very well to have an unfortunate\ntemperament; there was nothing so unfortunate as to have, for practical\npurposes, nothing else.  I avoided George Gravener at this moment and\nreflected that at such a time I should do so most effectually by leaving\nEngland.  I wanted to forget Frank Saltram\u2014that was all.  I didn\u2019t want\nto do anything in the world to him but that.  Indignation had withered on\nthe stalk, and I felt that one could pity him as much as one ought only\nby never thinking of him again.  It wasn\u2019t for anything he had done to\nme; it was for what he had done to the Mulvilles.  Adelaide cried about\nit for a week, and her husband, profiting by the example so signally\ngiven him of the fatal effect of a want of character, left the letter,\nthe drop too much, unanswered.  The letter, an incredible one, addressed\nby Saltram to Wimbledon during a stay with the Pudneys at Ramsgate, was\nthe central feature of the incident, which, however, had many features,\neach more painful than whichever other we compared it with.  The Pudneys\nhad behaved shockingly, but that was no excuse.  Base ingratitude, gross\nindecency\u2014one had one\u2019s choice only of such formulas as that the more\nthey fitted the less they gave one rest.  These are dead aches now, and I\nam under no obligation, thank heaven, to be definite about the business.\nThere are things which if I had had to tell them\u2014well, would have stopped\nme off here altogether.\n\nI went abroad for the general election, and if I don\u2019t know how much, on\nthe Continent, I forgot, I at least know how much I missed, him.  At a\ndistance, in a foreign land, ignoring, abjuring, unlearning him, I\ndiscovered what he had done for me.  I owed him, oh unmistakeably,\ncertain noble conceptions; I had lighted my little taper at his smoky\nlamp, and lo it continued to twinkle.  But the light it gave me just\nshowed me how much more I wanted.  I was pursued of course by letters\nfrom Mrs. Saltram which I didn\u2019t scruple not to read, though quite aware\nher embarrassments couldn\u2019t but be now of the gravest.  I sacrificed to\npropriety by simply putting them away, and this is how, one day as my\nabsence drew to an end, my eye, while I rummaged in my desk for another\npaper, was caught by a name on a leaf that had detached itself from the\npacket.  The allusion was to Miss Anvoy, who, it appeared, was engaged to\nbe married to Mr. George Gravener; and the news was two months old.  A\ndirect question of Mrs. Saltram\u2019s had thus remained unanswered\u2014she had\nenquired of me in a postscript what sort of man this aspirant to such a\nhand might be.  The great other fact about him just then was that he had\nbeen triumphantly returned for Clockborough in the interest of the party\nthat had swept the country\u2014so that I might easily have referred Mrs.\nSaltram to the journals of the day.  Yet when I at last wrote her that I\nwas coming home and would discharge my accumulated burden by seeing her,\nI but remarked in regard to her question that she must really put it to\nMiss Anvoy.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nI HAD almost avoided the general election, but some of its consequences,\non my return, had smartly to be faced.  The season, in London, began to\nbreathe again and to flap its folded wings.  Confidence, under the new\nMinistry, was understood to be reviving, and one of the symptoms, in a\nsocial body, was a recovery of appetite.  People once more fed together,\nand it happened that, one Saturday night, at somebody\u2019s house, I fed with\nGeorge Gravener.  When the ladies left the room I moved up to where he\nsat and begged to congratulate him.  \u201cOn my election?\u201d he asked after a\nmoment; so that I could feign, jocosely, not to have heard of that\ntriumph and to be alluding to the rumour of a victory still more\npersonal.  I dare say I coloured however, for his political success had\nmomentarily passed out of my mind.  What was present to it was that he\nwas to marry that beautiful girl; and yet his question made me conscious\nof some discomposure\u2014I hadn\u2019t intended to put this before everything.  He\nhimself indeed ought gracefully to have done so, and I remember thinking\nthe whole man was in this assumption that in expressing my sense of what\nhe had won I had fixed my thoughts on his \u201cseat.\u201d  We straightened the\nmatter out, and he was so much lighter in hand than I had lately seen him\nthat his spirits might well have been fed from a twofold source.  He was\nso good as to say that he hoped I should soon make the acquaintance of\nMiss Anvoy, who, with her aunt, was presently coming up to town.  Lady\nCoxon, in the country, had been seriously unwell, and this had delayed\ntheir arrival.  I told him I had heard the marriage would be a splendid\none; on which, brightened and humanised by his luck, he laughed and said\n\u201cDo you mean for her?\u201d  When I had again explained what I meant he went\non: \u201cOh she\u2019s an American, but you\u2019d scarcely know it; unless, perhaps,\u201d\nhe added, \u201cby her being used to more money than most girls in England,\neven the daughters of rich men.  That wouldn\u2019t in the least do for a\nfellow like me, you know, if it wasn\u2019t for the great liberality of her\nfather.  He really has been most kind, and everything\u2019s quite\nsatisfactory.\u201d  He added that his eldest brother had taken a tremendous\nfancy to her and that during a recent visit at Coldfield she had nearly\nwon over Lady Maddock.  I gathered from something he dropped later on\nthat the free-handed gentleman beyond the seas had not made a settlement,\nbut had given a handsome present and was apparently to be looked to,\nacross the water, for other favours.  People are simplified alike by\ngreat contentments and great yearnings, and, whether or no it was\nGravener\u2019s directness that begot my own, I seem to recall that in some\nturn taken by our talk he almost imposed it on me as an act of decorum to\nask if Miss Anvoy had also by chance expectations from her aunt.  My\nenquiry drew out that Lady Coxon, who was the oddest of women, would have\nin any contingency to act under her late husband\u2019s will, which was odder\nstill, saddling her with a mass of queer obligations complicated with\nqueer loopholes.  There were several dreary people, Coxon cousins, old\nmaids, to whom she would have more or less to minister.  Gravener\nlaughed, without saying no, when I suggested that the young lady might\ncome in through a loophole; then suddenly, as if he suspected my turning\na lantern on him, he declared quite dryly: \u201cThat\u2019s all rot\u2014one\u2019s moved by\nother springs!\u201d\n\nA fortnight later, at Lady Coxon\u2019s own house, I understood well enough\nthe springs one was moved by.  Gravener had spoken of me there as an old\nfriend, and I received a gracious invitation to dine.  The Knight\u2019s widow\nwas again indisposed\u2014she had succumbed at the eleventh hour; so that I\nfound Miss Anvoy bravely playing hostess without even Gravener\u2019s help,\nsince, to make matters worse, he had just sent up word that the House,\nthe insatiable House, with which he supposed he had contracted for easier\nterms, positively declined to release him.  I was struck with the\ncourage, the grace and gaiety of the young lady left thus to handle the\nfauna and flora of the Regent\u2019s Park.  I did what I could to help her to\nclassify them, after I had recovered from the confusion of seeing her\nslightly disconcerted at perceiving in the guest introduced by her\nintended the gentleman with whom she had had that talk about Frank\nSaltram.  I had at this moment my first glimpse of the fact that she was\na person who could carry a responsibility; but I leave the reader to\njudge of my sense of the aggravation, for either of us, of such a burden,\nwhen I heard the servant announce Mrs. Saltram.  From what immediately\npassed between the two ladies I gathered that the latter had been sent\nfor post-haste to fill the gap created by the absence of the mistress of\nthe house.  \u201cGood!\u201d I remember crying, \u201cshe\u2019ll be put by me;\u201d and my\napprehension was promptly justified.  Mrs. Saltram taken in to dinner,\nand taken in as a consequence of an appeal to her amiability, was Mrs.\nSaltram with a vengeance.  I asked myself what Miss Anvoy meant by doing\nsuch things, but the only answer I arrived at was that Gravener was\nverily fortunate.  She hadn\u2019t happened to tell him of her visit to Upper\nBaker Street, but she\u2019d certainly tell him to-morrow; not indeed that\nthis would make him like any better her having had the innocence to\ninvite such a person as Mrs. Saltram on such an occasion.  It could only\nstrike me that I had never seen a young woman put such ignorance into her\ncleverness, such freedom into her modesty; this, I think, was when, after\ndinner, she said to me frankly, with almost jubilant mirth: \u201cOh you don\u2019t\nadmire Mrs. Saltram?\u201d  Why should I?  This was truly a young person\nwithout guile.  I had briefly to consider before I could reply that my\nobjection to the lady named was the objection often uttered about people\nmet at the social board\u2014I knew all her stories.  Then as Miss Anvoy\nremained momentarily vague I added: \u201cThose about her husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, but there are some new ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone for me.  Ah novelty would be pleasant!\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it appear that of late he has been particularly horrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis fluctuations don\u2019t matter\u201d, I returned, \u201cfor at night all cats are\ngrey.  You saw the shade of this one the night we waited for him\ntogether.  What will you have?  He has no dignity.\u201d\n\nMiss Anvoy, who had been introducing with her American distinctness,\nlooked encouragingly round at some of the combinations she had risked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad I can\u2019t see him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean Gravener won\u2019t let you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t asked him.  He lets me do everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you know he knows him and wonders what some of us see in him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t happened to talk of him,\u201d the girl said.\n\n\u201cGet him to take you some day out to see the Mulvilles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought Mr. Saltram had thrown the Mulvilles over.\u201d\n\n\u201cUtterly.  But that won\u2019t prevent his being planted there again, to bloom\nlike a rose, within a month or two.\u201d\n\nMiss Anvoy thought a moment.  Then, \u201cI should like to see them,\u201d she said\nwith her fostering smile.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tremendously worth it.  You mustn\u2019t miss them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make George take me,\u201d she went on as Mrs. Saltram came up to\ninterrupt us.  She sniffed at this unfortunate as kindly as she had\nsmiled at me and, addressing the question to her, continued: \u201cBut the\nchance of a lecture\u2014one of the wonderful lectures?  Isn\u2019t there another\ncourse announced?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother?  There are about thirty!\u201d I exclaimed, turning away and feeling\nMrs. Saltram\u2019s little eyes in my back.  A few days after this I heard\nthat Gravener\u2019s marriage was near at hand\u2014was settled for Whitsuntide;\nbut as no invitation had reached me I had my doubts, and there presently\ncame to me in fact the report of a postponement.  Something was the\nmatter; what was the matter was supposed to be that Lady Coxon was now\ncritically ill.  I had called on her after my dinner in the Regent\u2019s\nPark, but I had neither seen her nor seen Miss Anvoy.  I forget to-day\nthe exact order in which, at this period, sundry incidents occurred and\nthe particular stage at which it suddenly struck me, making me catch my\nbreath a little, that the progression, the acceleration, was for all the\nworld that of fine drama.  This was probably rather late in the day, and\nthe exact order doesn\u2019t signify.  What had already occurred was some\naccident determining a more patient wait.  George Gravener, whom I met\nagain, in fact told me as much, but without signs of perturbation.  Lady\nCoxon had to be constantly attended to, and there were other good reasons\nas well.  Lady Coxon had to be so constantly attended to that on the\noccasion of a second attempt in the Regent\u2019s Park I equally failed to\nobtain a sight of her niece.  I judged it discreet in all the conditions\nnot to make a third; but this didn\u2019t matter, for it was through Adelaide\nMulville that the side-wind of the comedy, though I was at first\nunwitting, began to reach me.  I went to Wimbledon at times because\nSaltram was there, and I went at others because he wasn\u2019t.  The Pudneys,\nwho had taken him to Birmingham, had already got rid of him, and we had a\nhorrible consciousness of his wandering roofless, in dishonour, about the\nsmoky Midlands, almost as the injured Lear wandered on the storm-lashed\nheath.  His room, upstairs, had been lately done up (I could hear the\ncrackle of the new chintz) and the difference only made his smirches and\nbruises, his splendid tainted genius, the more tragic.  If he wasn\u2019t\nbarefoot in the mire he was sure to be unconventionally shod.  These were\nthe things Adelaide and I, who were old enough friends to stare at each\nother in silence, talked about when we didn\u2019t speak.  When we spoke it\nwas only about the brilliant girl George Gravener was to marry and whom\nhe had brought out the other Sunday.  I could see that this presentation\nhad been happy, for Mrs. Mulville commemorated it after her sole fashion\nof showing confidence in a new relation.  \u201cShe likes me\u2014she likes me\u201d:\nher native humility exulted in that measure of success.  We all knew for\nourselves how she liked those who liked her, and as regards Ruth Anvoy\nshe was more easily won over than Lady Maddock.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nONE of the consequences, for the Mulvilles, of the sacrifices they made\nfor Frank Saltram was that they had to give up their carriage.  Adelaide\ndrove gently into London in a one-horse greenish thing, an early\nVictorian landau, hired, near at hand, imaginatively, from a broken-down\njobmaster whose wife was in consumption\u2014a vehicle that made people turn\nround all the more when her pensioner sat beside her in a soft white hat\nand a shawl, one of the dear woman\u2019s own.  This was his position and I\ndare say his costume when on an afternoon in July she went to return Miss\nAnvoy\u2019s visit.  The wheel of fate had now revolved, and amid silences\ndeep and exhaustive, compunctions and condonations alike unutterable,\nSaltram was reinstated.  Was it in pride or in penance that Mrs. Mulville\nhad begun immediately to drive him about?  If he was ashamed of his\ningratitude she might have been ashamed of her forgiveness; but she was\nincorrigibly capable of liking him to be conspicuous in the landau while\nshe was in shops or with her acquaintance.  However, if he was in the\npillory for twenty minutes in the Regent\u2019s Park\u2014I mean at Lady Coxon\u2019s\ndoor while his companion paid her call\u2014it wasn\u2019t to the further\nhumiliation of any one concerned that she presently came out for him in\nperson, not even to show either of them what a fool she was that she drew\nhim in to be introduced to the bright young American.  Her account of the\nintroduction I had in its order, but before that, very late in the\nseason, under Gravener\u2019s auspices, I met Miss Anvoy at tea at the House\nof Commons.  The member for Clockborough had gathered a group of pretty\nladies, and the Mulvilles were not of the party.  On the great terrace,\nas I strolled off with her a little, the guest of honour immediately\nexclaimed to me: \u201cI\u2019ve seen him, you know\u2014I\u2019ve seen him!\u201d  She told me\nabout Saltram\u2019s call.\n\n\u201cAnd how did you find him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh so strange!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t like him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell till I see him again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to do that?\u201d\n\nShe had a pause.  \u201cImmensely.\u201d\n\nWe went no further; I fancied she had become aware Gravener was looking\nat us.  She turned back toward the knot of the others, and I said:\n\u201cDislike him as much as you will\u2014I see you\u2019re bitten.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitten?\u201d  I thought she coloured a little.\n\n\u201cOh it doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d I laughed; \u201cone doesn\u2019t die of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope I shan\u2019t die of anything before I\u2019ve seen more of Mrs. Mulville.\u201d\nI rejoiced with her over plain Adelaide, whom she pronounced the\nloveliest woman she had met in England; but before we separated I\nremarked to her that it was an act of mere humanity to warn her that if\nshe should see more of Frank Saltram\u2014which would be likely to follow on\nany increase of acquaintance with Mrs. Mulville\u2014she might find herself\nflattening her nose against the clear hard pane of an eternal\nquestion\u2014that of the relative, that of the opposed, importances of virtue\nand brains.  She replied that this was surely a subject on which one took\neverything for granted; whereupon I admitted that I had perhaps expressed\nmyself ill.  What I referred to was what I had referred to the night we\nmet in Upper Baker Street\u2014the relative importance (relative to virtue) of\nother gifts.  She asked me if I called virtue a gift\u2014a thing handed to us\nin a parcel on our first birthday; and I declared that this very enquiry\nproved to me the problem had already caught her by the skirt.  She would\nhave help however, the same help I myself had once had, in resisting its\ntendency to make one cross.\n\n\u201cWhat help do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat of the member for Clockborough.\u201d\n\nShe stared, smiled, then returned: \u201cWhy my idea has been to help him!\u201d\n\nShe had helped him\u2014I had his own word for it that at Clockborough her\nbedevilment of the voters had really put him in.  She would do so\ndoubtless again and again, though I heard the very next month that this\nfine faculty had undergone a temporary eclipse.  News of the catastrophe\nfirst came to me from Mrs. Saltram, and it was afterwards confirmed at\nWimbledon: poor Miss Anvoy was in trouble\u2014great disasters in America had\nsuddenly summoned her home.  Her father, in New York, had suffered\nreverses, lost so much money that it was really vexatious as showing how\nmuch he had had.  It was Adelaide who told me she had gone off alone at\nless than a week\u2019s notice.\n\n\u201cAlone?  Gravener has permitted that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will you have?  The House of Commons!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m afraid I cursed the House of Commons: I was so much interested.  Of\ncourse he\u2019d follow her as soon as he was free to make her his wife; only\nshe mightn\u2019t now be able to bring him anything like the marriage-portion\nof which he had begun by having the virtual promise.  Mrs. Mulville let\nme know what was already said: she was charming, this American girl, but\nreally these American fathers\u2014!  What was a man to do?  Mr. Saltram,\naccording to Mrs. Mulville, was of opinion that a man was never to suffer\nhis relation to money to become a spiritual relation\u2014he was to keep it\nexclusively material.  \u201cMoi pas comprendre!\u201d I commented on this; in\nrejoinder to which Adelaide, with her beautiful sympathy, explained that\nshe supposed he simply meant that the thing was to use it, don\u2019t you\nknow? but not to think too much about it.  \u201cTo take it, but not to thank\nyou for it?\u201d I still more profanely enquired.  For a quarter of an hour\nafterwards she wouldn\u2019t look at me, but this didn\u2019t prevent my asking her\nwhat had been the result, that afternoon\u2014in the Regent\u2019s Park, of her\ntaking our friend to see Miss Anvoy.\n\n\u201cOh so charming!\u201d she answered, brightening.  \u201cHe said he recognised in\nher a nature he could absolutely trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but I\u2019m speaking of the effect on herself.\u201d\n\nMrs. Mulville had to remount the stream.  \u201cIt was everything one could\nwish.\u201d\n\nSomething in her tone made me laugh.  \u201cDo you mean she gave him\u2014a dole?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, since you ask me!\u201d\n\n\u201cRight there on the spot?\u201d\n\nAgain poor Adelaide faltered.  \u201cIt was to me of course she gave it.\u201d\n\nI stared; somehow I couldn\u2019t see the scene.  \u201cDo you mean a sum of\nmoney?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was very handsome.\u201d  Now at last she met my eyes, though I could see\nit was with an effort.  \u201cThirty pounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cStraight out of her pocket?\u201d\n\n\u201cOut of the drawer of a table at which she had been writing.  She just\nslipped the folded notes into my hand.  He wasn\u2019t looking; it was while\nhe was going back to the carriage.\u201d  \u201cOh,\u201d said Adelaide reassuringly, \u201cI\ntake care of it for him!\u201d  The dear practical soul thought my agitation,\nfor I confess I was agitated, referred to the employment of the money.\nHer disclosure made me for a moment muse violently, and I dare say that\nduring that moment I wondered if anything else in the world makes people\nso gross as unselfishness.  I uttered, I suppose, some vague synthetic\ncry, for she went on as if she had had a glimpse of my inward amaze at\nsuch passages.  \u201cI assure you, my dear friend, he was in one of his happy\nhours.\u201d\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t thinking of that.  \u201cTruly indeed these Americans!\u201d I said.\n\u201cWith her father in the very act, as it were, of swindling her\nbetrothed!\u201d\n\nMrs. Mulville stared.  \u201cOh I suppose Mr. Anvoy has scarcely gone\nbankrupt\u2014or whatever he has done\u2014on purpose.  Very likely they won\u2019t be\nable to keep it up, but there it was, and it was a very beautiful\nimpulse.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say Saltram was very fine?\u201d\n\n\u201cBeyond everything.  He surprised even me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I know what you\u2019ve enjoyed.\u201d  After a moment I added: \u201cHad he\nperadventure caught a glimpse of the money in the table-drawer?\u201d\n\nAt this my companion honestly flushed.  \u201cHow can you be so cruel when you\nknow how little he calculates?\u201d\n\n\u201cForgive me, I do know it.  But you tell me things that act on my nerves.\nI\u2019m sure he hadn\u2019t caught a glimpse of anything but some splendid idea.\u201d\n\nMrs. Mulville brightly concurred.  \u201cAnd perhaps even of her beautiful\nlistening face.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps even!  And what was it all about?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis talk?  It was apropos of her engagement, which I had told him about:\nthe idea of marriage, the philosophy, the poetry, the sublimity of it.\u201d\nIt was impossible wholly to restrain one\u2019s mirth at this, and some rude\nripple that I emitted again caused my companion to admonish me.  \u201cIt\nsounds a little stale, but you know his freshness.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf illustration?  Indeed I do!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how he has always been right on that great question.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn what great question, dear lady, hasn\u2019t he been right?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf what other great men can you equally say it?\u2014and that he has never,\nbut never, had a deflexion?\u201d Mrs. Mulville exultantly demanded.\n\nI tried to think of some other great man, but I had to give it up.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t Miss Anvoy express her satisfaction in any less diffident way\nthan by her charming present?\u201d I was reduced to asking instead.\n\n\u201cOh yes, she overflowed to me on the steps while he was getting into the\ncarriage.\u201d  These words somehow brushed up a picture of Saltram\u2019s big\nshawled back as he hoisted himself into the green landau.  \u201cShe said she\nwasn\u2019t disappointed,\u201d Adelaide pursued.\n\nI turned it over.  \u201cDid he wear his shawl?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis shawl?\u201d  She hadn\u2019t even noticed.\n\n\u201cI mean yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe looked very nice, and you know he\u2019s really clean.  Miss Anvoy used\nsuch a remarkable expression\u2014she said his mind\u2019s like a crystal!\u201d\n\nI pricked up my ears.  \u201cA crystal?\u201d\n\n\u201cSuspended in the moral world\u2014swinging and shining and flashing there.\nShe\u2019s monstrously clever, you know.\u201d\n\nI thought again.  \u201cMonstrously!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nGEORGE GRAVENER didn\u2019t follow her, for late in September, after the House\nhad risen, I met him in a railway-carriage.  He was coming up from\nScotland and I had just quitted some relations who lived near Durham.\nThe current of travel back to London wasn\u2019t yet strong; at any rate on\nentering the compartment I found he had had it for some time to himself.\nWe fared in company, and though he had a blue-book in his lap and the\nopen jaws of his bag threatened me with the white teeth of confused\npapers, we inevitably, we even at last sociably conversed.  I saw things\nweren\u2019t well with him, but I asked no question till something dropped by\nhimself made, as it had made on another occasion, an absence of curiosity\ninvidious.  He mentioned that he was worried about his good old friend\nLady Coxon, who, with her niece likely to be detained some time in\nAmerica, lay seriously ill at Clockborough, much on his mind and on his\nhands.\n\n\u201cAh Miss Anvoy\u2019s in America?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer father has got into horrid straits\u2014has lost no end of money.\u201d\n\nI waited, after expressing due concern, but I eventually said: \u201cI hope\nthat raises no objection to your marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone whatever; moreover it\u2019s my trade to meet objections.  But it may\ncreate tiresome delays, of which there have been too many, from various\ncauses, already.  Lady Coxon got very bad, then she got much better.\nThen Mr. Anvoy suddenly began to totter, and now he seems quite on his\nback.  I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s really in for some big reverse.  Lady Coxon\u2019s\nworse again, awfully upset by the news from America, and she sends me\nword that she _must_ have Ruth.  How can I supply her with Ruth?  I\nhaven\u2019t got Ruth myself!\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely you haven\u2019t lost her?\u201d I returned.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s everything to her wretched father.  She writes me every\npost\u2014telling me to smooth her aunt\u2019s pillow.  I\u2019ve other things to\nsmooth; but the old lady, save for her servants, is really alone.  She\nwon\u2019t receive her Coxon relations\u2014she\u2019s angry at so much of her money\ngoing to them.  Besides, she\u2019s hopelessly mad,\u201d said Gravener very\nfrankly.\n\nI don\u2019t remember whether it was this, or what it was, that made me ask if\nshe hadn\u2019t such an appreciation of Mrs. Saltram as might render that\nactive person of some use.\n\nHe gave me a cold glance, wanting to know what had put Mrs. Saltram into\nmy head, and I replied that she was unfortunately never out of it.  I\nhappened to remember the wonderful accounts she had given me of the\nkindness Lady Coxon had shown her.  Gravener declared this to be false;\nLady Coxon, who didn\u2019t care for her, hadn\u2019t seen her three times.  The\nonly foundation for it was that Miss Anvoy, who used, poor girl, to chuck\nmoney about in a manner she must now regret, had for an hour seen in the\nmiserable woman\u2014you could never know what she\u2019d see in people\u2014an\ninteresting pretext for the liberality with which her nature overflowed.\nBut even Miss Anvoy was now quite tired of her.  Gravener told me more\nabout the crash in New York and the annoyance it had been to him, and we\nalso glanced here and there in other directions; but by the time we got\nto Doncaster the principal thing he had let me see was that he was\nkeeping something back.  We stopped at that station, and, at the\ncarriage-door, some one made a movement to get in.  Gravener uttered a\nsound of impatience, and I felt sure that but for this I should have had\nthe secret.  Then the intruder, for some reason, spared us his company;\nwe started afresh, and my hope of a disclosure returned.  My companion\nheld his tongue, however, and I pretended to go to sleep; in fact I\nreally dozed for discouragement.  When I reopened my eyes he was looking\nat me with an injured air.  He tossed away with some vivacity the remnant\nof a cigarette and then said: \u201cIf you\u2019re not too sleepy I want to put you\na case.\u201d  I answered that I\u2019d make every effort to attend, and welcomed\nthe note of interest when he went on: \u201cAs I told you a while ago, Lady\nCoxon, poor dear, is demented.\u201d  His tone had much behind it\u2014was full of\npromise.  I asked if her ladyship\u2019s misfortune were a trait of her malady\nor only of her character, and he pronounced it a product of both.  The\ncase he wanted to put to me was a matter on which it concerned him to\nhave the impression\u2014the judgement, he might also say\u2014of another person.\n\u201cI mean of the average intelligent man, but you see I take what I can\nget.\u201d There would be the technical, the strictly legal view; then there\nwould be the way the question would strike a man of the world.  He had\nlighted another cigarette while he talked, and I saw he was glad to have\nit to handle when he brought out at last, with a laugh slightly\nartificial: \u201cIn fact it\u2019s a subject on which Miss Anvoy and I are pulling\ndifferent ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you want me to decide between you?  I decide in advance for Miss\nAnvoy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn advance\u2014that\u2019s quite right.  That\u2019s how I decided when I proposed to\nher.  But my story will interest you only so far as your mind isn\u2019t made\nup.\u201d  Gravener puffed his cigarette a minute and then continued: \u201cAre you\nfamiliar with the idea of the Endowment of Research?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf Research?\u201d I was at sea a moment.\n\n\u201cI give you Lady Coxon\u2019s phrase.  She has it on the brain.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wishes to endow\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome earnest and \u2018loyal\u2019 seeker,\u201d Gravener said.  \u201cIt was a sketchy\ndesign of her late husband\u2019s, and he handed it on to her; setting apart\nin his will a sum of money of which she was to enjoy the interest for\nlife, but of which, should she eventually see her opportunity\u2014the matter\nwas left largely to her discretion\u2014she would best honour his memory by\ndetermining the exemplary public use.  This sum of money, no less than\nthirteen thousand pounds, was to be called The Coxon Fund; and poor Sir\nGregory evidently proposed to himself that The Coxon Fund should cover\nhis name with glory\u2014be universally desired and admired.  He left his wife\na full declaration of his views, so far at least as that term may be\napplied to views vitiated by a vagueness really infantine.  A little\nlearning\u2019s a dangerous thing, and a good citizen who happens to have been\nan ass is worse for a community than bad sewerage.  He\u2019s worst of all\nwhen he\u2019s dead, because then he can\u2019t be stopped.  However, such as they\nwere, the poor man\u2019s aspirations are now in his wife\u2019s bosom, or\nfermenting rather in her foolish brain: it lies with her to carry them\nout.  But of course she must first catch her hare.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer earnest loyal seeker?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe flower that blushes unseen for want of such a pecuniary independence\nas may aid the light that\u2019s in it to shine upon the human race.  The\nindividual, in a word, who, having the rest of the machinery, the\nspiritual, the intellectual, is most hampered in his search.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis search for what?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Moral Truth.  That\u2019s what Sir Gregory calls it.\u201d\n\nI burst out laughing.  \u201cDelightful munificent Sir Gregory!  It\u2019s a\ncharming idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Miss Anvoy thinks.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas she a candidate for the Fund?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that I know of\u2014and she\u2019s perfectly reasonable about it.  But Lady\nCoxon has put the matter before her, and we\u2019ve naturally had a lot of\ntalk.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk that, as you\u2019ve so interestingly intimated, has landed you in a\ndisagreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe considers there\u2019s something in it,\u201d Gravener said.\n\n\u201cAnd you consider there\u2019s nothing?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems to me a piece of solemn twaddle\u2014which can\u2019t fail to be attended\nwith consequences certainly grotesque and possibly immoral.  To begin\nwith, fancy constituting an endowment without establishing a tribunal\u2014a\nbench of competent people, of judges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sole tribunal is Lady Coxon?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd any one she chooses to invite.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she has invited you,\u201d I noted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not competent\u2014I hate the thing.  Besides, she hasn\u2019t,\u201d my friend\nwent on.  \u201cThe real history of the matter, I take it, is that the\ninspiration was originally Lady Coxon\u2019s own, that she infected him with\nit, and that the flattering option left her is simply his tribute to her\nbeautiful, her aboriginal enthusiasm.  She came to England forty years\nago, a thin transcendental Bostonian, and even her odd happy frumpy\nClockborough marriage never really materialised her.  She feels indeed\nthat she has become very British\u2014as if that, as a process, as a \u2018Werden,\u2019\nas anything but an original sign of grace, were conceivable; but it\u2019s\nprecisely what makes her cling to the notion of the \u2018Fund\u2019\u2014cling to it as\nto a link with the ideal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can she cling if she\u2019s dying?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean how can she act in the matter?\u201d Gravener asked.  \u201cThat\u2019s\nprecisely the question.  She can\u2019t!  As she has never yet caught her\nhare, never spied out her lucky impostor\u2014how should she, with the life\nshe has led?\u2014her husband\u2019s intention has come very near lapsing.  His\nidea, to do him justice, was that it _should_ lapse if exactly the right\nperson, the perfect mixture of genius and chill penury, should fail to\nturn up.  Ah the poor dear woman\u2019s very particular\u2014she says there must be\nno mistake.\u201d\n\nI found all this quite thrilling\u2014I took it in with avidity.  \u201cAnd if she\ndies without doing anything, what becomes of the money?\u201d I demanded.\n\n\u201cIt goes back to his family, if she hasn\u2019t made some other disposition of\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe may do that then\u2014she may divert it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer hands are not tied.  She has a grand discretion.  The proof is that\nthree months ago she offered to make the proceeds over to her niece.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Miss Anvoy\u2019s own use?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Miss Anvoy\u2019s own use\u2014on the occasion of her prospective marriage.\nShe was discouraged\u2014the earnest seeker required so earnest a search.  She\nwas afraid of making a mistake; every one she could think of seemed\neither not earnest enough or not poor enough.  On the receipt of the\nfirst bad news about Mr. Anvoy\u2019s affairs she proposed to Ruth to make the\nsacrifice for her.  As the situation in New York got worse she repeated\nher proposal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich Miss Anvoy declined?\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept as a formal trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean except as committing herself legally to place the money?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the head of the deserving object, the great man frustrated,\u201d said\nGravener.  \u201cShe only consents to act in the spirit of Sir Gregory\u2019s\nscheme.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you blame her for that?\u201d I asked with some intensity.\n\nMy tone couldn\u2019t have been harsh, but he coloured a little and there was\na queer light in his eye.  \u201cMy dear fellow, if I \u2018blamed\u2019 the young lady\nI\u2019m engaged to I shouldn\u2019t immediately say it even to so old a friend as\nyou.\u201d  I saw that some deep discomfort, some restless desire to be sided\nwith, reassuringly, approvingly mirrored, had been at the bottom of his\ndrifting so far, and I was genuinely touched by his confidence.  It was\ninconsistent with his habits; but being troubled about a woman was not,\nfor him, a habit: that itself was an inconsistency.  George Gravener\ncould stand straight enough before any other combination of forces.  It\namused me to think that the combination he had succumbed to had an\nAmerican accent, a transcendental aunt and an insolvent father; but all\nmy old loyalty to him mustered to meet this unexpected hint that I could\nhelp him.  I saw that I could from the insincere tone in which he\npursued: \u201cI\u2019ve criticised her of course, I\u2019ve contended with her, and it\nhas been great fun.\u201d  Yet it clearly couldn\u2019t have been such great fun as\nto make it improper for me presently to ask if Miss Anvoy had nothing at\nall settled on herself.  To this he replied that she had only a trifle\nfrom her mother\u2014a mere four hundred a year, which was exactly why it\nwould be convenient to him that she shouldn\u2019t decline, in the face of\nthis total change in her prospects, an accession of income which would\ndistinctly help them to marry.  When I enquired if there were no other\nway in which so rich and so affectionate an aunt could cause the weight\nof her benevolence to be felt, he answered that Lady Coxon was\naffectionate indeed, but was scarcely to be called rich.  She could let\nher project of the Fund lapse for her niece\u2019s benefit, but she couldn\u2019t\ndo anything else.  She had been accustomed to regard her as tremendously\nprovided for, and she was up to her eyes in promises to anxious Coxons.\nShe was a woman of an inordinate conscience, and her conscience was now a\ndistress to her, hovering round her bed in irreconcilable forms of\nresentful husbands, portionless nieces and undiscoverable philosophers.\n\nWe were by this time getting into the whirr of fleeting platforms, the\nmultiplication of lights.  \u201cI think you\u2019ll find,\u201d I said with a laugh,\n\u201cthat your predicament will disappear in the very fact that the\nphilosopher _is_ undiscoverable.\u201d\n\nHe began to gather up his papers.  \u201cWho can set a limit to the ingenuity\nof an extravagant woman?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, after all, who indeed?\u201d I echoed as I recalled the extravagance\ncommemorated in Adelaide\u2019s anecdote of Miss Anvoy and the thirty pounds.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nTHE thing I had been most sensible of in that talk with George Gravener\nwas the way Saltram\u2019s name kept out of it.  It seemed to me at the time\nthat we were quite pointedly silent about him; but afterwards it appeared\nmore probable there had been on my companion\u2019s part no conscious\navoidance.  Later on I was sure of this, and for the best of reasons\u2014the\nsimple reason of my perceiving more completely that, for evil as well as\nfor good, he said nothing to Gravener\u2019s imagination.  That honest man\ndidn\u2019t fear him\u2014he was too much disgusted with him.  No more did I,\ndoubtless, and for very much the same reason.  I treated my friend\u2019s\nstory as an absolute confidence; but when before Christmas, by Mrs.\nSaltram, I was informed of Lady Coxon\u2019s death without having had news of\nMiss Anvoy\u2019s return, I found myself taking for granted we should hear no\nmore of these nuptials, in which, as obscurely unnatural, I now saw I had\nnever _too_ disconcertedly believed.  I began to ask myself how people\nwho suited each other so little could please each other so much.  The\ncharm was some material charm, some afffinity, exquisite doubtless, yet\nsuperficial some surrender to youth and beauty and passion, to force and\ngrace and fortune, happy accidents and easy contacts.  They might dote on\neach other\u2019s persons, but how could they know each other\u2019s souls?  How\ncould they have the same prejudices, how could they have the same\nhorizon?  Such questions, I confess, seemed quenched but not answered\nwhen, one day in February, going out to Wimbledon, I found our young lady\nin the house.  A passion that had brought her back across the wintry\nocean was as much of a passion as was needed.  No impulse equally strong\nindeed had drawn George Gravener to America; a circumstance on which,\nhowever, I reflected only long enough to remind myself that it was none\nof my business.  Ruth Anvoy was distinctly different, and I felt that the\ndifference was not simply that of her marks of mourning.  Mrs. Mulville\ntold me soon enough what it was: it was the difference between a handsome\ngirl with large expectations and a handsome girl with only four hundred a\nyear.  This explanation indeed didn\u2019t wholly content me, not even when I\nlearned that her mourning had a double cause\u2014learned that poor Mr. Anvoy,\ngiving way altogether, buried under the ruins of his fortune and leaving\nnext to nothing, had died a few weeks before.\n\n\u201cSo she has come out to marry George Gravener?\u201d I commented.  \u201cWouldn\u2019t\nit have been prettier of him to have saved her the trouble?\u201d\n\n\u201cHasn\u2019t the House just met?\u201d Adelaide replied.  \u201cAnd for Mr. Gravener the\nHouse\u2014!\u201d  Then she added: \u201cI gather that her having come is exactly a\nsign that the marriage is a little shaky.  If it were quite all right a\nself-respecting girl like Ruth would have waited for him over there.\u201d\n\nI noted that they were already Ruth and Adelaide, but what I said was:\n\u201cDo you mean she\u2019ll have had to return to _make_ it so?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I mean that she must have come out for some reason independent of\nit.\u201d  Adelaide could only surmise, however, as yet, and there was more,\nas we found, to be revealed.  Mrs. Mulville, on hearing of her arrival,\nhad brought the young lady out in the green landau for the Sunday.  The\nCoxons were in possession of the house in Regent\u2019s Park, and Miss Anvoy\nwas in dreary lodgings.  George Gravener had been with her when Adelaide\ncalled, but had assented graciously enough to the little visit at\nWimbledon.  The carriage, with Mr. Saltram in it but not mentioned, had\nbeen sent off on some errand from which it was to return and pick the\nladies up.  Gravener had left them together, and at the end of an hour,\non the Saturday afternoon, the party of three had driven out to\nWimbledon.  This was the girl\u2019s second glimpse of our great man, and I\nwas interested in asking Mrs. Mulville if the impression made by the\nfirst appeared to have been confirmed.  On her replying after\nconsideration, that of course with time and opportunity it couldn\u2019t fail\nto be, but that she was disappointed, I was sufficiently struck with her\nuse of this last word to question her further.\n\n\u201cDo you mean you\u2019re disappointed because you judge Miss Anvoy to be?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; I hoped for a greater effect last evening.  We had two or three\npeople, but he scarcely opened his mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be all the better to-night,\u201d I opined after a moment.  Then I\npursued: \u201cWhat particular importance do you attach to the idea of her\nbeing impressed?\u201d\n\nAdelaide turned her mild pale eyes on me as for rebuke of my levity.\n\u201cWhy the importance of her being as happy as _we_ are!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m afraid that at this my levity grew.  \u201cOh that\u2019s a happiness almost\ntoo great to wish a person!\u201d  I saw she hadn\u2019t yet in her mind what I had\nin mine, and at any rate the visitor\u2019s actual bliss was limited to a walk\nin the garden with Kent Mulville.  Later in the afternoon I also took\none, and I saw nothing of Miss Anvoy till dinner, at which we failed of\nthe company of Saltram, who had caused it to be reported that he was\nindisposed and lying down.  This made us, most of us\u2014for there were other\nfriends present\u2014convey to each other in silence some of the unutterable\nthings that in those years our eyes had inevitably acquired the art of\nexpressing.  If a fine little American enquirer hadn\u2019t been there we\nwould have expressed them otherwise, and Adelaide would have pretended\nnot to hear.  I had seen her, before the very fact, abstract herself\nnobly; and I knew that more than once, to keep it from the servants,\nmanaging, dissimulating cleverly, she had helped her husband to carry him\nbodily to his room.  Just recently he had been so wise and so deep and so\nhigh that I had begun to get nervous\u2014to wonder if by chance there were\nsomething behind it, if he were kept straight for instance by the\nknowledge that the hated Pudneys would have more to tell us if they\nchose.  He was lying low, but unfortunately it was common wisdom with us\nin this connexion that the biggest splashes took place in the quietest\npools.  We should have had a merry life indeed if all the splashes had\nsprinkled us as refreshingly as the waters we were even then to feel\nabout our ears.  Kent Mulville had been up to his room, but had come back\nwith a face that told as few tales as I had seen it succeed in telling on\nthe evening I waited in the lecture-room with Miss Anvoy.  I said to\nmyself that our friend had gone out, but it was a comfort that the\npresence of a comparative stranger deprived us of the dreary duty of\nsuggesting to each other, in respect of his errand, edifying\npossibilities in which we didn\u2019t ourselves believe.  At ten o\u2019clock he\ncame into the drawing-room with his waistcoat much awry but his eyes\nsending out great signals.  It was precisely with his entrance that I\nceased to be vividly conscious of him.  I saw that the crystal, as I had\ncalled it, had begun to swing, and I had need of my immediate attention\nfor Miss Anvoy.\n\nEven when I was told afterwards that he had, as we might have said\nto-day, broken the record, the manner in which that attention had been\nrewarded relieved me of a sense of loss.  I had of course a perfect\ngeneral consciousness that something great was going on: it was a little\nlike having been etherised to hear Herr Joachim play.  The old music was\nin the air; I felt the strong pulse of thought, the sink and swell, the\nflight, the poise, the plunge; but I knew something about one of the\nlisteners that nobody else knew, and Saltram\u2019s monologue could reach me\nonly through that medium.  To this hour I\u2019m of no use when, as a witness,\nI\u2019m appealed to\u2014for they still absurdly contend about it\u2014as to whether or\nno on that historic night he was drunk; and my position is slightly\nridiculous, for I\u2019ve never cared to tell them what it really was I was\ntaken up with.  What I got out of it is the only morsel of the total\nexperience that is quite my own.  The others were shared, but this is\nincommunicable.  I feel that now, I\u2019m bound to say, even in thus roughly\nevoking the occasion, and it takes something from my pride of clearness.\nHowever, I shall perhaps be as clear as is absolutely needful if I remark\nthat our young lady was too much given up to her own intensity of\nobservation to be sensible of mine.  It was plainly not the question of\nher marriage that had brought her back.  I greatly enjoyed this discovery\nand was sure that had that question alone been involved she would have\nstirred no step.  In this case doubtless Gravener would, in spite of the\nHouse of Commons, have found means to rejoin her.  It afterwards made me\nuncomfortable for her that, alone in the lodging Mrs. Mulville had put\nbefore me as dreary, she should have in any degree the air of waiting for\nher fate; so that I was presently relieved at hearing of her having gone\nto stay at Coldfield.  If she was in England at all while the engagement\nstood the only proper place for her was under Lady Maddock\u2019s wing.  Now\nthat she was unfortunate and relatively poor, perhaps her prospective\nsister-in-law would be wholly won over.\n\nThere would be much to say, if I had space, about the way her behaviour,\nas I caught gleams of it, ministered to the image that had taken birth in\nmy mind, to my private amusement, while that other night I listened to\nGeorge Gravener in the railway-carriage.  I watched her in the light of\nthis queer possibility\u2014a formidable thing certainly to meet\u2014and I was\naware that it coloured, extravagantly perhaps, my interpretation of her\nvery looks and tones.  At Wimbledon for instance it had appeared to me\nshe was literally afraid of Saltram, in dread of a coercion that she had\nbegun already to feel.  I had come up to town with her the next day and\nhad been convinced that, though deeply interested, she was immensely on\nher guard.  She would show as little as possible before she should be\nready to show everything.  What this final exhibition might be on the\npart of a girl perceptibly so able to think things out I found it great\nsport to forecast.  It would have been exciting to be approached by her,\nappealed to by her for advice; but I prayed to heaven I mightn\u2019t find\nmyself in such a predicament.  If there was really a present rigour in\nthe situation of which Gravener had sketched for me the elements, she\nwould have to get out of her difficulty by herself.  It wasn\u2019t I who had\nlaunched her and it wasn\u2019t I who could help her.  I didn\u2019t fail to ask\nmyself why, since I couldn\u2019t help her, I should think so much about her.\nIt was in part my suspense that was responsible for this; I waited\nimpatiently to see whether she wouldn\u2019t have told Mrs. Mulville a portion\nat least of what I had learned from Gravener.  But I saw Mrs. Mulville\nwas still reduced to wonder what she had come out again for if she hadn\u2019t\ncome as a conciliatory bride.  That she had come in some other character\nwas the only thing that fitted all the appearances.  Having for family\nreasons to spend some time that spring in the west of England, I was in a\nmanner out of earshot of the great oceanic rumble\u2014I mean of the\ncontinuous hum of Saltram\u2019s thought\u2014and my uneasiness tended to keep me\nquiet.  There was something I wanted so little to have to say that my\nprudence surmounted my curiosity.  I only wondered if Ruth Anvoy talked\nover the idea of The Coxon Fund with Lady Maddock, and also somewhat why\nI didn\u2019t hear from Wimbledon.  I had a reproachful note about something\nor other from Mrs. Saltram, but it contained no mention of Lady Coxon\u2019s\nniece, on whom her eyes had been much less fixed since the recent\nuntoward events.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nPOOR Adelaide\u2019s silence was fully explained later\u2014practically explained\nwhen in June, returning to London, I was honoured by this admirable woman\nwith an early visit.  As soon as she arrived I guessed everything, and as\nsoon as she told me that darling Ruth had been in her house nearly a\nmonth I had my question ready.  \u201cWhat in the name of maidenly modesty is\nshe staying in England for?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause she loves me so!\u201d cried Adelaide gaily.  But she hadn\u2019t come to\nsee me only to tell me Miss Anvoy loved her: that was quite sufficiently\nestablished, and what was much more to the point was that Mr. Gravener\nhad now raised an objection to it.  He had protested at least against her\nbeing at Wimbledon, where in the innocence of his heart he had originally\nbrought her himself; he called on her to put an end to their engagement\nin the only proper, the only happy manner.\n\n\u201cAnd why in the world doesn\u2019t she do do?\u201d I asked.\n\nAdelaide had a pause.  \u201cShe says you know.\u201d\n\nThen on my also hesitating she added: \u201cA condition he makes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Coxon Fund?\u201d I panted.\n\n\u201cHe has mentioned to her his having told you about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh but so little!  Do you mean she has accepted the trust?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the most splendid spirit\u2014as a duty about which there can be no two\nopinions.\u201d  To which my friend added: \u201cOf course she\u2019s thinking of Mr.\nSaltram.\u201d\n\nI gave a quick cry at this, which, in its violence, made my visitor turn\npale.  \u201cHow very awful!\u201d\n\n\u201cAwful?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, to have anything to do with such an idea one\u2019s self.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure _you_ needn\u2019t!\u201d and Mrs. Mulville tossed her head.\n\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t good enough!\u201d I went on; to which she opposed a sound almost as\ncontentious as my own had been.  This made me, with genuine immediate\nhorror, exclaim: \u201cYou haven\u2019t influenced her, I hope!\u201d and my emphasis\nbrought back the blood with a rush to poor Adelaide\u2019s face.  She declared\nwhile she blushed\u2014for I had frightened her again\u2014that she had never\ninfluenced anybody and that the girl had only seen and heard and judged\nfor herself.  _He_ had influenced her, if I would, as he did every one\nwho had a soul: that word, as we knew, even expressed feebly the power of\nthe things he said to haunt the mind.  How could she, Adelaide, help it\nif Miss Anvoy\u2019s mind was haunted?  I demanded with a groan what right a\npretty girl engaged to a rising M.P. had to _have_ a mind; but the only\nexplanation my bewildered friend could give me was that she was so\nclever.  She regarded Mr. Saltram naturally as a tremendous force for\ngood.  She was intelligent enough to understand him and generous enough\nto admire.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s many things enough, but is she, among them, rich enough?\u201d I\ndemanded.  \u201cRich enough, I mean, to sacrifice such a lot of good money?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for herself to judge.  Besides, it\u2019s not her own money; she\ndoesn\u2019t in the least consider it so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Gravener does, if not _his_ own; and that\u2019s the whole difficulty?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe difficulty that brought her back, yes: she had absolutely to see her\npoor aunt\u2019s solicitor.  It\u2019s clear that by Lady Coxon\u2019s will she may have\nthe money, but it\u2019s still clearer to her conscience that the original\ncondition, definite, intensely implied on her uncle\u2019s part, is attached\nto the use of it.  She can only take one view of it.  It\u2019s for the\nEndowment or it\u2019s for nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Endowment,\u201d I permitted myself to observe, \u201cis a conception\nsuperficially sublime, but fundamentally ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you repeating Mr. Gravener\u2019s words?\u201d Adelaide asked.\n\n\u201cPossibly, though I\u2019ve not seen him for months.  It\u2019s simply the way it\nstrikes me too.  It\u2019s an old wife\u2019s tale.  Gravener made some reference\nto the legal aspect, but such an absurdly loose arrangement has _no_\nlegal aspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuth doesn\u2019t insist on that,\u201d said Mrs. Mulville; \u201cand it\u2019s, for her,\nexactly this technical weakness that constitutes the force of the moral\nobligation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you repeating _her_ words?\u201d I enquired.  I forget what else Adelaide\nsaid, but she said she was magnificent.  I thought of George Gravener\nconfronted with such magnificence as that, and I asked what could have\nmade two such persons ever suppose they understood each other.  Mrs.\nMulville assured me the girl loved him as such a woman could love and\nthat she suffered as such a woman could suffer.  Nevertheless she wanted\nto see _me_.  At this I sprang up with a groan.  \u201cOh I\u2019m so sorry!\u2014when?\u201d\nSmall though her sense of humour, I think Adelaide laughed at my\nsequence.  We discussed the day, the nearest it would be convenient I\nshould come out; but before she went I asked my visitor how long she had\nbeen acquainted with these prodigies.\n\n\u201cFor several weeks, but I was pledged to secrecy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t write?\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t very well tell you she was with me without telling you that\nno time had even yet been fixed for her marriage.  And I couldn\u2019t very\nwell tell you as much as that without telling you what I knew of the\nreason of it.  It was not till a day or two ago,\u201d Mrs. Mulville went on,\n\u201cthat she asked me to ask you if you wouldn\u2019t come and see her.  Then at\nlast she spoke of your knowing about the idea of the Endowment.\u201d\n\nI turned this over.  \u201cWhy on earth does she want to see me?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo talk with you, naturally, about Mr. Saltram.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a subject for the prize?\u201d  This was hugely obvious, and I presently\nreturned: \u201cI think I\u2019ll sail to-morrow for Australia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then\u2014sail!\u201d said Mrs. Mulville, getting up.\n\nBut I frivolously, continued.  \u201cOn Thursday at five, we said?\u201d  The\nappointment was made definite and I enquired how, all this time, the\nunconscious candidate had carried himself.\n\n\u201cIn perfection, really, by the happiest of chances: he has positively\nbeen a dear.  And then, as to what we revere him for, in the most\nwonderful form.  His very highest\u2014pure celestial light.  You _won\u2019t_ do\nhim an ill turn?\u201d Adelaide pleaded at the door.\n\n\u201cWhat danger can equal for him the danger to which he\u2019s exposed from\nhimself?\u201d I asked.  \u201cLook out sharp, if he has lately been too prim.\nHe\u2019ll presently take a day off, treat us to some exhibition that will\nmake an Endowment a scandal.\u201d\n\n\u201cA scandal?\u201d Mrs. Mulville dolorously echoed.\n\n\u201cIs Miss Anvoy prepared for that?\u201d\n\nMy visitor, for a moment, screwed her parasol into my carpet.  \u201cHe grows\nbigger every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo do you!\u201d I laughed as she went off.\n\nThat girl at Wimbledon, on the Thursday afternoon, more than justified my\napprehensions.  I recognised fully now the cause of the agitation she had\nproduced in me from the first\u2014the faint foreknowledge that there was\nsomething very stiff I should have to do for her.  I felt more than ever\ncommitted to my fate as, standing before her in the big drawing-room\nwhere they had tactfully left us to ourselves, I tried with a smile to\nstring together the pearls of lucidity which, from her chair, she\nsuccessively tossed me.  Pale and bright, in her monotonous mourning, she\nwas an image of intelligent purpose, of the passion of duty; but I asked\nmyself whether any girl had ever had so charming an instinct as that\nwhich permitted her to laugh out, as for the joy of her difficulty, into\nthe priggish old room.  This remarkable young woman could be earnest\nwithout being solemn, and at moments when I ought doubtless to have\ncursed her obstinacy I found myself watching the unstudied play of her\neyebrows or the recurrence of a singularly intense whiteness produced by\nthe parting of her lips.  These aberrations, I hasten to add, didn\u2019t\nprevent my learning soon enough why she had wished to see me.  Her reason\nfor this was as distinct as her beauty: it was to make me explain what I\nhad meant, on the occasion of our first meeting, by Mr. Saltram\u2019s want of\ndignity.  It wasn\u2019t that she couldn\u2019t imagine, but she desired it there\nfrom my lips.  What she really desired of course was to know whether\nthere was worse about him than what she had found out for herself.  She\nhadn\u2019t been a month so much in the house with him without discovering\nthat he wasn\u2019t a man of monumental bronze.  He was like a jelly minus its\nmould, he had to be embanked; and that was precisely the source of her\ninterest in him and the ground of her project.  She put her project\nboldly before me: there it stood in its preposterous beauty.  She was as\nwilling to take the humorous view of it as I could be: the only\ndifference was that for her the humorous view of a thing wasn\u2019t\nnecessarily prohibitive, wasn\u2019t paralysing.\n\nMoreover she professed that she couldn\u2019t discuss with me the primary\nquestion\u2014the moral obligation: that was in her own breast.  There were\nthings she couldn\u2019t go into\u2014injunctions, impressions she had received.\nThey were a part of the closest intimacy of her intercourse with her\naunt, they were absolutely clear to her; and on questions of delicacy,\nthe interpretation of a fidelity, of a promise, one had always in the\nlast resort to make up one\u2019s mind for one\u2019s self.  It was the idea of the\napplication to the particular case, such a splendid one at last, that\ntroubled her, and she admitted that it stirred very deep things.  She\ndidn\u2019t pretend that such a responsibility was a simple matter; if it\n_had_ been she wouldn\u2019t have attempted to saddle me with any portion of\nit.  The Mulvilles were sympathy itself, but were they absolutely candid?\nCould they indeed be, in their position\u2014would it even have been to be\ndesired?  Yes, she had sent for me to ask no less than that of me\u2014whether\nthere was anything dreadful kept back.  She made no allusion whatever to\nGeorge Gravener\u2014I thought her silence the only good taste and her gaiety\nperhaps a part of the very anxiety of that discretion, the effect of a\ndetermination that people shouldn\u2019t know from herself that her relations\nwith the man she was to marry were strained.  All the weight, however,\nthat she left me to throw was a sufficient implication of the weight _he_\nhad thrown in vain.  Oh she knew the question of character was immense,\nand that one couldn\u2019t entertain any plan for making merit comfortable\nwithout running the gauntlet of that terrible procession of\ninterrogation-points which, like a young ladies\u2019 school out for a walk,\nhooked their uniform noses at the tail of governess Conduct.  But were we\nabsolutely to hold that there was never, never, never an exception,\nnever, never, never an occasion for liberal acceptance, for clever\ncharity, for suspended pedantry\u2014for letting one side, in short,\noutbalance another?  When Miss Anvoy threw off this appeal I could have\nembraced her for so delightfully emphasising her unlikeness to Mrs.\nSaltram.  \u201cWhy not have the courage of one\u2019s forgiveness,\u201d she asked, \u201cas\nwell as the enthusiasm of one\u2019s adhesion?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeeing how wonderfully you\u2019ve threshed the whole thing out,\u201d I evasively\nreplied, \u201cgives me an extraordinary notion of the point your enthusiasm\nhas reached.\u201d\n\nShe considered this remark an instant with her eyes on mine, and I\ndivined that it struck her I might possibly intend it as a reference to\nsome personal subjection to our fat philosopher, to some aberration of\nsensibility, some perversion of taste.  At least I couldn\u2019t interpret\notherwise the sudden flash that came into her face.  Such a\nmanifestation, as the result of any word of mine, embarrassed me; but\nwhile I was thinking how to reassure her the flush passed away in a smile\nof exquisite good nature.  \u201cOh you see one forgets so wonderfully how one\ndislikes him!\u201d she said; and if her tone simply extinguished his strange\nfigure with the brush of its compassion, it also rings in my ear to-day\nas the purest of all our praises.  But with what quick response of fine\npity such a relegation of the man himself made me privately sigh \u201cAh poor\nSaltram!\u201d  She instantly, with this, took the measure of all I didn\u2019t\nbelieve, and it enabled her to go on: \u201cWhat can one do when a person has\ngiven such a lift to one\u2019s interest in life?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, what can one do?\u201d  If I struck her as a little vague it was because\nI was thinking of another person.  I indulged in another inarticulate\nmurmur\u2014\u201cPoor George Gravener!\u201d  What had become of the lift _he_ had\ngiven that interest?  Later on I made up my mind that she was sore and\nstricken at the appearance he presented of wanting the miserable money.\nThis was the hidden reason of her alienation.  The probable sincerity, in\nspite of the illiberality, of his scruples about the particular use of it\nunder discussion didn\u2019t efface the ugliness of his demand that they\nshould buy a good house with it.  Then, as for _his_ alienation, he\ndidn\u2019t, pardonably enough, grasp the lift Frank Saltram had given her\ninterest in life.  If a mere spectator could ask that last question, with\nwhat rage in his heart the man himself might!  He wasn\u2019t, like her, I was\nto see, too proud to show me why he was disappointed.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nI WAS unable this time to stay to dinner: such at any rate was the plea\non which I took leave.  I desired in truth to get away from my young\nlady, for that obviously helped me not to pretend to satisfy her.  How\n_could_ I satisfy her?  I asked myself\u2014how could I tell her how much had\nbeen kept back?  I didn\u2019t even know and I certainly didn\u2019t desire to\nknow.  My own policy had ever been to learn the least about poor\nSaltram\u2019s weaknesses\u2014not to learn the most.  A great deal that I had in\nfact learned had been forced upon me by his wife.  There was something\neven irritating in Miss Anvoy\u2019s crude conscientiousness, and I wondered\nwhy, after all, she couldn\u2019t have let him alone and been content to\nentrust George Gravener with the purchase of the good house.  I was sure\nhe would have driven a bargain, got something excellent and cheap.  I\nlaughed louder even than she, I temporised, I failed her; I told her I\nmust think over her case.  I professed a horror of responsibilities and\ntwitted her with her own extravagant passion for them.  It wasn\u2019t really\nthat I was afraid of the scandal, the moral discredit for the Fund; what\ntroubled me most was a feeling of a different order.  Of course, as the\nbeneficiary of the Fund was to enjoy a simple life-interest, as it was\nhoped that new beneficiaries would arise and come up to new standards, it\nwouldn\u2019t be a trifle that the first of these worthies shouldn\u2019t have been\na striking example of the domestic virtues.  The Fund would start badly,\nas it were, and the laurel would, in some respects at least, scarcely be\ngreener from the brows of the original wearer.  That idea, however, was\nat that hour, as I have hinted, not the source of solicitude it ought\nperhaps to have been, for I felt less the irregularity of Saltram\u2019s\ngetting the money than that of this exalted young woman\u2019s giving it up.\nI wanted her to have it for herself, and I told her so before I went\naway.  She looked graver at this than she had looked at all, saying she\nhoped such a preference wouldn\u2019t make me dishonest.\n\nIt made me, to begin with, very restless\u2014made me, instead of going\nstraight to the station, fidget a little about that many-coloured Common\nwhich gives Wimbledon horizons.  There was a worry for me to work off, or\nrather keep at a distance, for I declined even to admit to myself that I\nhad, in Miss Anvoy\u2019s phrase, been saddled with it.  What could have been\nclearer indeed than the attitude of recognising perfectly what a world of\ntrouble The Coxon Fund would in future save us, and of yet liking better\nto face a continuance of that trouble than see, and in fact contribute\nto, a deviation from attainable bliss in the life of two other persons in\nwhom I was deeply interested?  Suddenly, at the end of twenty minutes,\nthere was projected across this clearness the image of a massive\nmiddle-aged man seated on a bench under a tree, with sad far-wandering\neyes and plump white hands folded on the head of a stick\u2014a stick I\nrecognised, a stout gold-headed staff that I had given him in devoted\ndays.  I stopped short as he turned his face to me, and it happened that\nfor some reason or other I took in as I had perhaps never done before the\nbeauty of his rich blank gaze.  It was charged with experience as the sky\nis charged with light, and I felt on the instant as if we had been\noverspanned and conjoined by the great arch of a bridge or the great dome\nof a temple.  Doubtless I was rendered peculiarly sensitive to it by\nsomething in the way I had been giving him up and sinking him.  While I\nmet it I stood there smitten, and I felt myself responding to it with a\nsort of guilty grimace.  This brought back his attention in a smile which\nexpressed for me a cheerful weary patience, a bruised noble gentleness.\nI had told Miss Anvoy that he had no dignity, but what did he seem to me,\nall unbuttoned and fatigued as he waited for me to come up, if he didn\u2019t\nseem unconcerned with small things, didn\u2019t seem in short majestic?  There\nwas majesty in his mere unconsciousness of our little conferences and\npuzzlements over his maintenance and his reward.\n\nAfter I had sat by him a few minutes I passed my arm over his big soft\nshoulder\u2014wherever you touched him you found equally little firmness\u2014and\nsaid in a tone of which the suppliance fell oddly on my own ear: \u201cCome\nback to town with me, old friend\u2014come back and spend the evening.\u201d  I\nwanted to hold him, I wanted to keep him, and at Waterloo, an hour later,\nI telegraphed possessively to the Mulvilles.  When he objected, as\nregards staying all night, that he had no things, I asked him if he\nhadn\u2019t everything of mine.  I had abstained from ordering dinner, and it\nwas too late for preliminaries at a club; so we were reduced to tea and\nfried fish at my rooms\u2014reduced also to the transcendent.  Something had\ncome up which made me want him to feel at peace with me\u2014and which,\nprecisely, was all the dear man himself wanted on any occasion.  I had\ntoo often had to press upon him considerations irrelevant, but it gives\nme pleasure now to think that on that particular evening I didn\u2019t even\nmention Mrs. Saltram and the children.  Late into the night we smoked and\ntalked; old shames and old rigours fell away from us; I only let him see\nthat I was conscious of what I owed him.  He was as mild as contrition\nand as copious as faith; he was never so fine as on a shy return, and\neven better at forgiving than at being forgiven.  I dare say it was a\nsmaller matter than that famous night at Wimbledon, the night of the\nproblematical sobriety and of Miss Anvoy\u2019s initiation; but I was as much\nin it on this occasion as I had been out of it then.  At about 1.30 he\nwas sublime.\n\nHe never, in whatever situation, rose till all other risings were over,\nand his breakfasts, at Wimbledon, had always been the principal reason\nmentioned by departing cooks.  The coast was therefore clear for me to\nreceive her when, early the next morning, to my surprise, it was\nannounced to me his wife had called.  I hesitated, after she had come up,\nabout telling her Saltram was in the house, but she herself settled the\nquestion, kept me reticent by drawing forth a sealed letter which,\nlooking at me very hard in the eyes, she placed, with a pregnant absence\nof comment, in my hand.  For a single moment there glimmered before me\nthe fond hope that Mrs. Saltram had tendered me, as it were, her\nresignation and desired to embody the act in an unsparing form.  To bring\nthis about I would have feigned any humiliation; but after my eyes had\ncaught the superscription I heard myself say with a flatness that\nbetrayed a sense of something very different from relief: \u201cOh the\nPudneys!\u201d  I knew their envelopes though they didn\u2019t know mine.  They\nalways used the kind sold at post-offices with the stamp affixed, and as\nthis letter hadn\u2019t been posted they had wasted a penny on me.  I had seen\ntheir horrid missives to the Mulvilles, but hadn\u2019t been in direct\ncorrespondence with them.\n\n\u201cThey enclosed it to me, to be delivered.  They doubtless explain to you\nthat they hadn\u2019t your address.\u201d\n\nI turned the thing over without opening it.  \u201cWhy in the world should\nthey write to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause they\u2019ve something to tell you.  The worst,\u201d Mrs. Saltram dryly\nadded.\n\nIt was another chapter, I felt, of the history of their lamentable\nquarrel with her husband, the episode in which, vindictively,\ndisingenuously as they themselves had behaved, one had to admit that he\nhad put himself more grossly in the wrong than at any moment of his life.\nHe had begun by insulting the matchless Mulvilles for these more specious\nprotectors, and then, according to his wont at the end of a few months,\nhad dug a still deeper ditch for his aberration than the chasm left\nyawning behind.  The chasm at Wimbledon was now blessedly closed; but the\nPudneys, across their persistent gulf, kept up the nastiest fire.  I\nnever doubted they had a strong case, and I had been from the first for\nnot defending him\u2014reasoning that if they weren\u2019t contradicted they\u2019d\nperhaps subside.  This was above all what I wanted, and I so far\nprevailed that I did arrest the correspondence in time to save our little\ncircle an infliction heavier than it perhaps would have borne.  I knew,\nthat is I divined, that their allegations had gone as yet only as far as\ntheir courage, conscious as they were in their own virtue of an exposed\nplace in which Saltram could have planted a blow.  It was a question with\nthem whether a man who had himself so much to cover up would dare his\nblow; so that these vessels of rancour were in a manner afraid of each\nother.  I judged that on the day the Pudneys should cease for some reason\nor other to be afraid they would treat us to some revelation more\ndisconcerting than any of its predecessors.  As I held Mrs. Saltram\u2019s\nletter in my hand it was distinctly communicated to me that the day had\ncome\u2014they had ceased to be afraid.  \u201cI don\u2019t want to know the worst,\u201d I\npresently declared.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to open the letter.  It also contains an enclosure.\u201d\n\nI felt it\u2014it was fat and uncanny.  \u201cWheels within wheels!\u201d I exclaimed.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something for me too to deliver.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo they tell me\u2014to Miss Anvoy.\u201d\n\nI stared; I felt a certain thrill.  \u201cWhy don\u2019t they send it to her\ndirectly?\u201d\n\nMrs. Saltram hung fire.  \u201cBecause she\u2019s staying with Mr. and Mrs.\nMulville.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why should that prevent?\u201d\n\nAgain my visitor faltered, and I began to reflect on the grotesque, the\nunconscious perversity of her action.  I was the only person save George\nGravener and the Mulvilles who was aware of Sir Gregory Coxon\u2019s and of\nMiss Anvoy\u2019s strange bounty.  Where could there have been a more signal\nillustration of the clumsiness of human affairs than her having\ncomplacently selected this moment to fly in the face of it?  \u201cThere\u2019s the\nchance of their seeing her letters.  They know Mr. Pudney\u2019s hand.\u201d\n\nStill I didn\u2019t understand; then it flashed upon me.  \u201cYou mean they might\nintercept it?  How can you imply anything so base?\u201d I indignantly\ndemanded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not I\u2014it\u2019s Mr. Pudney!\u201d cried Mrs. Saltram with a flush.  \u201cIt\u2019s his\nown idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why couldn\u2019t he send the letter to you to be delivered?\u201d\n\nMrs. Saltram\u2019s embarrassment increased; she gave me another hard look.\n\u201cYou must make that out for yourself.\u201d\n\nI made it out quickly enough.  \u201cIt\u2019s a denunciation?\u201d\n\n\u201cA real lady doesn\u2019t betray her husband!\u201d this virtuous woman exclaimed.\n\nI burst out laughing, and I fear my laugh may have had an effect of\nimpertinence.  \u201cEspecially to Miss Anvoy, who\u2019s so easily shocked? Why do\nsuch things concern _her_?\u201d I asked, much at a loss.\n\n\u201cBecause she\u2019s there, exposed to all his craft.  Mr. and Mrs. Pudney have\nbeen watching this: they feel she may be taken in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for all the rest of us!  What difference can it make when she\nhas lost her power to contribute?\u201d\n\nAgain Mrs. Saltram considered; then very nobly: \u201cThere are other things\nin the world than money.\u201d  This hadn\u2019t occurred to her so long as the\nyoung lady had any; but she now added, with a glance at my letter, that\nMr. and Mrs. Pudney doubtless explained their motives.  \u201cIt\u2019s all in\nkindness,\u201d she continued as she got up.\n\n\u201cKindness to Miss Anvoy?  You took, on the whole, another view of\nkindness before her reverses.\u201d\n\nMy companion smiled with some acidity \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re no safer than the\nMulvilles!\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t want her to think that, nor that she should report to the\nPudneys that they had not been happy in their agent; and I well remember\nthat this was the moment at which I began, with considerable emotion, to\npromise myself to enjoin upon Miss Anvoy never to open any letter that\nshould come to her in one of those penny envelopes.  My emotion, and I\nfear I must add my confusion, quickly deepened; I presently should have\nbeen as glad to frighten Mrs. Saltram as to think I might by some\ndiplomacy restore the Pudneys to a quieter vigilance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s best you should take _my_ view of my safety,\u201d I at any rate soon\nresponded.  When I saw she didn\u2019t know what I meant by this I added: \u201cYou\nmay turn out to have done, in bringing me this letter, a thing you\u2019ll\nprofoundly regret.\u201d  My tone had a significance which, I could see, did\nmake her uneasy, and there was a moment, after I had made two or three\nmore remarks of studiously bewildering effect, at which her eyes followed\nso hungrily the little flourish of the letter with which I emphasised\nthem that I instinctively slipped Mr. Pudney\u2019s communication into my\npocket.  She looked, in her embarrassed annoyance, capable of grabbing it\nto send it back to him.  I felt, after she had gone, as if I had almost\ngiven her my word I wouldn\u2019t deliver the enclosure.  The passionate\nmovement, at any rate, with which, in solitude, I transferred the whole\nthing, unopened, from my pocket to a drawer which I double-locked would\nhave amounted, for an initiated observer, to some such pledge.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM left me drawing my breath more quickly and indeed almost in\npain\u2014as if I had just perilously grazed the loss of something precious.\nI didn\u2019t quite know what it was\u2014it had a shocking resemblance to my\nhonour.  The emotion was the livelier surely in that my pulses even yet\nvibrated to the pleasure with which, the night before, I had rallied to\nthe rare analyst, the great intellectual adventurer and pathfinder.  What\nhad dropped from me like a cumbersome garment as Saltram appeared before\nme in the afternoon on the heath was the disposition to haggle over his\nvalue.  Hang it, one had to choose, one had to put that value somewhere;\nso I would put it really high and have done with it.  Mrs. Mulville drove\nin for him at a discreet hour\u2014the earliest she could suppose him to have\ngot up; and I learned that Miss Anvoy would also have come had she not\nbeen expecting a visit from Mr. Gravener.  I was perfectly mindful that I\nwas under bonds to see this young lady, and also that I had a letter to\nhand to her; but I took my time, I waited from day to day.  I left Mrs.\nSaltram to deal as her apprehensions should prompt with the Pudneys.  I\nknew at last what I meant\u2014I had ceased to wince at my responsibility.  I\ngave this supreme impression of Saltram time to fade if it would; but it\ndidn\u2019t fade, and, individually, it hasn\u2019t faded even now.  During the\nmonth that I thus invited myself to stiffen again, Adelaide Mulville,\nperplexed by my absence, wrote to me to ask why I _was_ so stiff.  At\nthat season of the year I was usually oftener \u201cwith\u201d them.  She also\nwrote that she feared a real estrangement had set in between Mr. Gravener\nand her sweet young friend\u2014a state of things but half satisfactory to her\nso long as the advantage resulting to Mr. Saltram failed to disengage\nitself from the merely nebulous state.  She intimated that her sweet\nyoung friend was, if anything, a trifle too reserved; she also intimated\nthat there might now be an opening for another clever young man.  There\nnever was the slightest opening, I may here parenthesise, and of course\nthe question can\u2019t come up to-day.  These are old frustrations now.  Ruth\nAnvoy hasn\u2019t married, I hear, and neither have I.  During the month,\ntoward the end, I wrote to George Gravener to ask if, on a special\nerrand, I might come to see him, and his answer was to knock the very\nnext day at my door.  I saw he had immediately connected my enquiry with\nthe talk we had had in the railway-carriage, and his promptitude showed\nthat the ashes of his eagerness weren\u2019t yet cold.  I told him there was\nsomething I felt I ought in candour to let him know\u2014I recognised the\nobligation his friendly confidence had laid on me.\n\n\u201cYou mean Miss Anvoy has talked to you?  She has told me so herself,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t to tell you so that I wanted to see you,\u201d I replied; \u201cfor it\nseemed to me that such a communication would rest wholly with herself.\nIf however she did speak to you of our conversation she probably told you\nI was discouraging.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiscouraging?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the subject of a present application of The Coxon Fund.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the case of Mr. Saltram?  My dear fellow, I don\u2019t know what you call\ndiscouraging!\u201d Gravener cried.\n\n\u201cWell I thought I was, and I thought she thought I was.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe she did, but such a thing\u2019s measured by the effect.  She\u2019s not\n\u2018discouraged,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s her own affair.  The reason I asked you to see me was that it\nappeared to me I ought to tell you frankly that\u2014decidedly!\u2014I can\u2019t\nundertake to produce that effect.  In fact I don\u2019t want to!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good of you, damn you!\u201d my visitor laughed, red and really\ngrave.  Then he said: \u201cYou\u2019d like to see that scoundrel publicly\nglorified\u2014perched on the pedestal of a great complimentary pension?\u201d\n\nI braced myself.  \u201cTaking one form of public recognition with another it\nseems to me on the whole I should be able to bear it.  When I see the\ncompliments that _are_ paid right and left I ask myself why this one\nshouldn\u2019t take its course.  This therefore is what you\u2019re entitled to\nhave looked to me to mention to you.  I\u2019ve some evidence that perhaps\nwould be really dissuasive, but I propose to invite Mss Anvoy to remain\nin ignorance of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd to invite me to do the same?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh you don\u2019t require it\u2014you\u2019ve evidence enough.  I speak of a sealed\nletter that I\u2019ve been requested to deliver to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t mean to?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one consideration that would make me,\u201d I said.\n\nGravener\u2019s clear handsome eyes plunged into mine a minute, but evidently\nwithout fishing up a clue to this motive\u2014a failure by which I was almost\nwounded.  \u201cWhat does the letter contain?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sealed, as I tell you, and I don\u2019t know what it contains.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is it sent through you?\u201d\n\n\u201cRather than you?\u201d I wondered how to put the thing.  \u201cThe only\nexplanation I can think of is that the person sending it may have\nimagined your relations with Miss Anvoy to be at an end\u2014may have been\ntold this is the case by Mrs. Saltram.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy relations with Miss Anvoy are not at an end,\u201d poor Gravener\nstammered.\n\nAgain for an instant I thought.  \u201cThe offer I propose to make you gives\nme the right to address you a question remarkably direct.  Are you still\nengaged to Miss Anvoy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d he slowly brought out.  \u201cBut we\u2019re perfectly good\nfriends.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch good friends that you\u2019ll again become prospective husband and wife\nif the obstacle in your path be removed?\u201d\n\n\u201cRemoved?\u201d he anxiously repeated.\n\n\u201cIf I send Miss Anvoy the letter I speak of she may give up her idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen for God\u2019s sake send it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do so if you\u2019re ready to assure me that her sacrifice would now\npresumably bring about your marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d marry her the next day!\u201d my visitor cried.\n\n\u201cYes, but would she marry _you_?  What I ask of you of course is nothing\nless than your word of honour as to your conviction of this.  If you give\nit me,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll engage to hand her the letter before night.\u201d\n\nGravener took up his hat; turning it mechanically round he stood looking\na moment hard at its unruffled perfection.  Then very angrily honestly\nand gallantly, \u201cHand it to the devil!\u201d he broke out; with which he\nclapped the hat on his head and left me.\n\n\u201cWill you read it or not?\u201d I said to Ruth Anvoy, at Wimbledon, when I had\ntold her the story of Mrs. Saltram\u2019s visit.\n\nShe debated for a time probably of the briefest, but long enough to make\nme nervous.  \u201cHave you brought it with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo indeed.  It\u2019s at home, locked up.\u201d\n\nThere was another great silence, and then she said \u201cGo back and destroy\nit.\u201d\n\nI went back, but I didn\u2019t destroy it till after Saltram\u2019s death, when I\nburnt it unread.  The Pudneys approached her again pressingly, but,\nprompt as they were, The Coxon Fund had already become an operative\nbenefit and a general amaze: Mr. Saltram, while we gathered about, as it\nwere, to watch the manna descend, had begun to draw the magnificent\nincome.  He drew it as he had always drawn everything, with a grand\nabstracted gesture.  Its magnificence, alas, as all the world now knows,\nquite quenched him; it was the beginning of his decline.  It was also\nnaturally a new grievance for his wife, who began to believe in him as\nsoon as he was blighted, and who at this hour accuses us of having bribed\nhim, on the whim of a meddlesome American, to renounce his glorious\noffice, to become, as she says, like everybody else.  The very day he\nfound himself able to publish he wholly ceased to produce.  This deprived\nus, as may easily be imagined, of much of our occupation, and especially\ndeprived the Mulvilles, whose want of self-support I never measured till\nthey lost their great inmate.  They\u2019ve no one to live on now.  Adelaide\u2019s\nmost frequent reference to their destitution is embodied in the remark\nthat dear far-away Ruth\u2019s intentions were doubtless good.  She and Kent\nare even yet looking for another prop, but no one presents a true sphere\nof usefulness.  They complain that people are self-sufficing.  With\nSaltram the fine type of the child of adoption was scattered, the\ngrander, the elder style.  They\u2019ve got their carriage back, but what\u2019s an\nempty carriage?  In short I think we were all happier as well as poorer\nbefore; even including George Gravener, who by the deaths of his brother\nand his nephew has lately become Lord Maddock.  His wife, whose fortune\nclears the property, is criminally dull; he hates being in the Upper\nHouse, and hasn\u2019t yet had high office.  But what are these accidents,\nwhich I should perhaps apologise for mentioning, in the light of the\ngreat eventual boon promised the patient by the rate at which The Coxon\nFund must be rolling up?",

her soft smiles shone afar,\n And her low voice was heard like love, and drew\n All living things towards this wonder new.\n\n 6.\n And first the spotted cameleopard came,\n And then the wise and fearless elephant;                      _90\n Then the sly serpent, in the golden flame\n Of his own volumes intervolved;--all gaunt\n And sanguine beasts her gentle looks made tame.\n They drank before her at her sacred fount;\n And every beast of beating heart grew bold,                   _95\n Such gentleness and power even to behold.\n\n 7.\n The brinded lioness led forth her young,\n That she might teach them how they should forego\n Their inborn thirst of death; the pard unstrung\n His sinews at her feet, and sought to know                    _100\n With looks whose motions spoke without a tongue\n How he might be as gentle as the doe.\n The magic circle of her voice and eyes\n All savage natures did imparadise.\n\n 8.\n And old Silenus, shaking a green stick                        _105\n Of lilies, and the wood-gods in a crew\n Came, blithe, as in the olive copses thick\n Cicadae are, drunk with the noonday dew:\n And Dryope and Faunus followed quick,\n Teasing the God to sing them something new;                   _110\n Till in this cave they found the lady lone,\n Sitting upon a seat of emerald stone.\n\n 9.\n And universal Pan, 'tis said, was there,\n And though none saw him,--through the adamant\n Of the deep mountains, through the trackless air,             _115\n And through those living spirits, like a want,\n He passed out of his everlasting lair\n Where the quick heart of the great world doth pant,\n And felt that wondrous lady all alone,--\n And she felt him, upon her emerald throne.                    _120\n\n 10.\n And every nymph of stream and spreading tree,\n And every shepherdess of Ocean's flocks,\n Who drives her white waves over the green sea,\n And Ocean with the brine on his gray locks,\n And quaint Priapus with his company,                          _125\n All came, much wondering how the enwombed rocks\n Could have brought forth so beautiful a birth;--\n Her love subdued their wonder and their mirth.\n\n 11.\n The herdsmen and the mountain maidens came,\n And the rude kings of pastoral Garamant--                     _130\n Their spirits shook within them, as a flame\n Stirred by the air under a cavern gaunt:\n Pigmies, and Polyphemes, by many a name,\n Centaurs, and Satyrs, and such shapes as haunt\n Wet clefts,--and lumps neither alive nor dead,                _135\n Dog-headed, bosom-eyed, and bird-footed.\n\n 12.\n For she was beautiful--her beauty made\n The bright world dim, and everything beside\n Seemed like the fleeting image of a shade:\n No thought of living spirit could abide,                      _140\n Which to her looks had ever been betrayed,\n On any object in the world so wide,\n On any hope within the circling skies,\n But on her form, and in her inmost eyes.\n\n 13.\n Which when the lady knew, she took her spindle                _145\n And twined three threads of fleecy mist, and three\n Long lines of light, such as the dawn may kindle\n The clouds and waves and mountains with; and she\n As many star-beams, ere their lamps could dwindle\n In the belated moon, wound skilfully;                         _150\n And with these threads a subtle veil she wove--\n A shadow for the splendour of her love.\n\n 14.\n The deep recesses of her odorous dwelling\n Were stored with magic treasures--sounds of air,\n Which had the power all spirits of compelling,                _155\n Folded in cells of crystal silence there;\n Such as we hear in youth, and think the feeling\n Will never die--yet ere we are aware,\n The feeling and the sound are fled and gone,\n And the regret they leave remains alone.                      _160\n\n 15.\n And there lay Visions swift, and sweet, and quaint,\n Each in its thin sheath, like a chrysalis,\n Some eager to burst forth, some weak and faint\n With the soft burthen of intensest bliss.\n It was its work to bear to many a saint                       _165\n Whose heart adores the shrine which holiest is,\n Even Love's:--and others white, green, gray, and black,\n And of all shapes--and each was at her beck.\n\n 16.\n And odours in a kind of aviary\n Of ever-blooming Eden-trees she kept,                         _170\n Clipped in a floating net, a love-sick Fairy\n Had woven from dew-beams while the moon yet slept;\n As bats at the wired window of a dairy,\n They beat their vans; and each was an adept,\n When loosed and missioned, making wings of winds,             _175\n To stir sweet thoughts or sad, in destined minds.\n\n 17.\n And liquors clear and sweet, whose healthful might\n Could medicine the sick soul to happy sleep,\n And change eternal death into a night\n Of glorious dreams--or if eyes needs must weep,               _180\n Could make their tears all wonder and delight,\n She in her crystal vials did closely keep:\n If men could drink of those clear vials, 'tis said\n The living were not envied of the dead.\n\n 18.\n Her cave was stored with scrolls of strange device,           _185\n The works of some Saturnian Archimage,\n Which taught the expiations at whose price\n Men from the Gods might win that happy age\n Too lightly lost, redeeming native vice;\n And which might quench the Earth-consuming rage               _190\n Of gold and blood--till men should live and move\n Harmonious as the sacred stars above;\n\n 19.\n And how all things that seem untameable,\n Not to be checked and not to be confined,\n Obey the spells of Wisdom's wizard skill;                     _195\n Time, earth, and fire--the ocean and the wind,\n And all their shapes--and man's imperial will;\n And other scrolls whose writings did unbind\n The inmost lore of Love--let the profane\n Tremble to ask what secrets they contain.                     _200\n\n 20.\n And wondrous works of substances unknown,\n To which the enchantment of her father's power\n Had changed those ragged blocks of savage stone,\n Were heaped in the recesses of her bower;\n Carved lamps and chalices, and vials which shone              _205\n In their own golden beams--each like a flower,\n Out of whose depth a fire-fly shakes his light\n Under a cypress in a starless night.\n\n 21.\n At first she lived alone in this wild home,\n And her own thoughts were each a minister,                    _210\n Clothing themselves, or with the ocean foam,\n Or with the wind, or with the speed of fire,\n To work whatever purposes might come\n Into her mind; such power her mighty Sire\n Had girt them with, whether to fly or run,                    _215\n Through all the regions which he shines upon.\n\n 22.\n The Ocean-nymphs and Hamadryades,\n Oreads and Naiads, with long weedy locks,\n Offered to do her bidding through the seas,\n Under the earth, and in the hollow rocks,                     _220\n And far beneath the matted roots of trees,\n And in the gnarled heart of stubborn oaks,\n So they might live for ever in the light\n Of her sweet presence--each a satellite.\n\n 23.\n 'This may not be,' the wizard maid replied;                   _225\n 'The fountains where the Naiades bedew\n Their shining hair, at length are drained and dried;\n The solid oaks forget their strength, and strew\n Their latest leaf upon the mountains wide;\n The boundless ocean like a drop of dew                        _230\n Will be consumed--the stubborn centre must\n Be scattered, like a cloud of summer dust.\n\n 24.\n 'And ye with them will perish, one by one;--\n If I must sigh to think that this shall be,\n If I must weep when the surviving Sun                         _235\n Shall smile on your decay--oh, ask not me\n To love you till your little race is run;\n I cannot die as ye must--over me\n Your leaves shall glance--the streams in which ye dwell\n Shall be my paths henceforth, and so--farewell!'--            _240\n\n 25.\n She spoke and wept:--the dark and azure well\n Sparkled beneath the shower of her bright tears,\n And every little circlet where they fell\n Flung to the cavern-roof inconstant spheres\n And intertangled lines of light:--a knell                     _245\n Of sobbing voices came upon her ears\n From those departing Forms, o'er the serene\n Of the white streams and of the forest green.\n\n 26.\n All day the wizard lady sate aloof,\n Spelling out scrolls of dread antiquity,                      _250\n Under the cavern's fountain-lighted roof;\n Or broidering the pictured poesy\n Of some high tale upon her growing woof,\n Which the sweet splendour of her smiles could dye\n In hues outshining heaven--and ever she                       _255\n Added some grace to the wrought poesy.\n\n 27.\n While on her hearth lay blazing many a piece\n Of sandal wood, rare gums, and cinnamon;\n Men scarcely know how beautiful fire is--\n Each flame of it is as a precious stone                       _260\n Dissolved in ever-moving light, and this\n Belongs to each and all who gaze upon.\n The Witch beheld it not, for in her hand\n She held a woof that dimmed the burning brand.\n\n 28.\n This lady never slept, but lay in trance                      _265\n All night within the fountain--as in sleep.\n Its emerald crags glowed in her beauty's glance;\n Through the green splendour of the water deep\n She saw the constellations reel and dance\n Like fire-flies--and withal did ever keep                     _270\n The tenour of her contemplations calm,\n With open eyes, closed feet, and folded palm.\n\n 29.\n And when the whirlwinds and the clouds descended\n From the white pinnacles of that cold hill,\n She passed at dewfall to a space extended,                    _275\n Where in a lawn of flowering asphodel\n Amid a wood of pines and cedars blended,\n There yawned an inextinguishable well\n Of crimson fire--full even to the brim,\n And overflowing all the margin trim.                          _280\n\n 30.\n Within the which she lay when the fierce war\n Of wintry winds shook that innocuous liquor\n In many a mimic moon and bearded star\n O'er woods and lawns;--the serpent heard it flicker\n In sleep, and dreaming still, he crept afar--                 _285\n And when the windless snow descended thicker\n Than autumn leaves, she watched it as it came\n Melt on the surface of the level flame.\n\n 31.\n She had a boat, which some say Vulcan wrought\n For Venus, as the chariot of her star;                        _290\n But it was found too feeble to be fraught\n With all the ardours in that sphere which are,\n And so she sold it, and Apollo bought\n And gave it to this daughter: from a car\n Changed to the fairest and the lightest boat                  _295\n Which ever upon mortal stream did float.\n\n 32.\n And others say, that, when but three hours old,\n The first-born Love out of his cradle lept,\n And clove dun Chaos with his wings of gold,\n And like a horticultural adept,                               _300\n Stole a strange seed, and wrapped it up in mould,\n And sowed it in his mother's star, and kept\n Watering it all the summer with sweet dew,\n And with his wings fanning it as it grew.\n\n 33.\n The plant grew strong and green, the snowy flower             _305\n Fell, and the long and gourd-like fruit began\n To turn the light and dew by inward power\n To its own substance; woven tracery ran\n Of light firm texture, ribbed and branching, o'er\n The solid rind, like a leaf's veined fan--                    _310\n Of which Love scooped this boat--and with soft motion\n Piloted it round the circumfluous ocean.\n\n 34.\n This boat she moored upon her fount, and lit\n A living spirit within all its frame,\n Breathing the soul of swiftness into it.                      _315\n Couched on the fountain like a panther tame,\n One of the twain at Evan's feet that sit--\n Or as on Vesta's sceptre a swift flame--\n Or on blind Homer's heart a winged thought,--\n In joyous expectation lay the boat.                           _320\n\n 35.\n Then by strange art she kneaded fire and snow\n Together, tempering the repugnant mass\n With liquid love--all things together grow\n Through which the harmony of love can pass;\n And a fair Shape out of her hands did flow--                  _325\n A living Image, which did far surpass\n In beauty that bright shape of vital stone\n Which drew the heart out of Pygmalion.\n\n 36.\n A sexless thing it was, and in its growth\n It seemed to have developed no defect                         _330\n Of either sex, yet all the grace of both,--\n In gentleness and strength its limbs were decked;\n The bosom swelled lightly with its full youth,\n The countenance was such as might select\n Some artist that his skill should never die,                  _335\n Imaging forth such perfect purity.\n\n 37.\n From its smooth shoulders hung two rapid wings,\n Fit to have borne it to the seventh sphere,\n Tipped with the speed of liquid lightenings,\n Dyed in the ardours of the atmosphere:                        _340\n She led her creature to the boiling springs\n Where the light boat was moored, and said: 'Sit here!'\n And pointed to the prow, and took her seat\n Beside the rudder, with opposing feet.\n\n 38.\n And down the streams which clove those mountains vast,        _345\n Around their inland islets, and amid\n The panther-peopled forests whose shade cast\n Darkness and odours, and a pleasure hid\n In melancholy gloom, the pinnace passed;\n By many a star-surrounded pyramid                             _350\n Of icy crag cleaving the purple sky,\n And caverns yawning round unfathomably.\n\n 39.\n The silver noon into that winding dell,\n With slanted gleam athwart the forest tops,\n Tempered like golden evening, feebly fell;                    _355\n A green and glowing light, like that which drops\n From folded lilies in which glow-worms dwell,\n When Earth over her face Night's mantle wraps;\n Between the severed mountains lay on high,\n Over the stream, a narrow rift of sky.                        _360\n\n 40.\n And ever as she went, the Image lay\n With folded wings and unawakened eyes;\n And o'er its gentle countenance did play\n The busy dreams, as thick as summer flies,\n Chasing the rapid smiles that would not stay,                 _365\n And drinking the warm tears, and the sweet sighs\n Inhaling, which, with busy murmur vain,\n They had aroused from that full heart and brain.\n\n 41.\n And ever down the prone vale, like a cloud\n Upon a stream of wind, the pinnace went:                      _370\n Now lingering on the pools, in which abode\n The calm and darkness of the deep content\n In which they paused; now o'er the shallow road\n Of white and dancing waters, all besprent\n With sand and polished pebbles:--mortal boat                  _375\n In such a shallow rapid could not float.\n\n 42.\n And down the earthquaking cataracts which shiver\n Their snow-like waters into golden air,\n Or under chasms unfathomable ever\n Sepulchre them, till in their rage they tear                  _380\n A subterranean portal for the river,\n It fled--the circling sunbows did upbear\n Its fall down the hoar precipice of spray,\n Lighting it far upon its lampless way.\n\n 43.\n And when the wizard lady would ascend                         _385\n The labyrinths of some many-winding vale,\n Which to the inmost mountain upward tend--\n She called 'Hermaphroditus!'--and the pale\n And heavy hue which slumber could extend\n Over its lips and eyes, as on the gale                        _390\n A rapid shadow from a slope of grass,\n Into the darkness of the stream did pass.\n\n 44.\n And it unfurled its heaven-coloured pinions,\n With stars of fire spotting the stream below;\n And from above into the Sun's dominions                       _395\n Flinging a glory, like the golden glow\n In which Spring clothes her emerald-winged minions,\n All interwoven with fine feathery snow\n And moonlight splendour of intensest rime,\n With which frost paints the pines in winter time.             _400\n\n 45.\n And then it winnowed the Elysian air\n Which ever hung about that lady bright,\n With its aethereal vans--and speeding there,\n Like a star up the torrent of the night,\n Or a swift eagle in the morning glare                         _405\n Breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight,\n The pinnace, oared by those enchanted wings,\n Clove the fierce streams towards their upper springs.\n\n 46.\n The water flashed, like sunlight by the prow\n Of a noon-wandering meteor flung to Heaven;                   _410\n The still air seemed as if its waves did flow\n In tempest down the mountains; loosely driven\n The lady's radiant hair streamed to and fro:\n Beneath, the billows having vainly striven\n Indignant and impetuous, roared to feel                       _415\n The swift and steady motion of the keel.\n\n 47.\n Or, when the weary moon was in the wane,\n Or in the noon of interlunar night,\n The lady-witch in visions could not chain\n Her spirit; but sailed forth under the light                  _420\n Of shooting stars, and bade extend amain\n Its storm-outspeeding wings, the Hermaphrodite;\n She to the Austral waters took her way,\n Beyond the fabulous Thamondocana,--\n\n 48.\n Where, like a meadow which no scythe has shaven,              _425\n Which rain could never bend, or whirl-blast shake,\n With the Antarctic constellations paven,\n Canopus and his crew, lay the Austral lake--\n There she would build herself a windless haven\n Out of the clouds whose moving turrets make                   _430\n The bastions of the storm, when through the sky\n The spirits of the tempest thundered by:\n\n 49.\n A haven beneath whose translucent floor\n The tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably,\n And around which the solid vapours hoar,                      _435\n Based on the level waters, to the sky\n Lifted their dreadful crags, and like a shore\n Of wintry mountains, inaccessibly\n Hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray,\n And hanging crags, many a cove and bay.                       _440\n\n 50.\n And whilst the outer lake beneath the lash\n Of the wind's scourge, foamed like a wounded thing,\n And the incessant hail with stony clash\n Ploughed up the waters, and the flagging wing\n Of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash                _445\n Looked like the wreck of some wind-wandering\n Fragment of inky thunder-smoke--this haven\n Was as a gem to copy Heaven engraven,--\n\n 51.\n On which that lady played her many pranks,\n Circling the image of a shooting star,                        _450\n Even as a tiger on Hydaspes' banks\n Outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are,\n In her light boat; and many quips and cranks\n She played upon the water, till the car\n Of the late moon, like a sick matron wan,                     _455\n To journey from the misty east began.\n\n 52.\n And then she called out of the hollow turrets\n Of those high clouds, white, golden and vermilion,\n The armies of her ministering spirits--\n In mighty legions, million after million,                     _460\n They came, each troop emblazoning its merits\n On meteor flags; and many a proud pavilion\n Of the intertexture of the atmosphere\n They pitched upon the plain of the calm mere.\n\n 53.\n They framed the imperial tent of their great Queen            _465\n Of woven exhalations, underlaid\n With lambent lightning-fire, as may be seen\n A dome of thin and open ivory inlaid\n With crimson silk--cressets from the serene\n Hung there, and on the water for her tread                    _470\n A tapestry of fleece-like mist was strewn,\n Dyed in the beams of the ascending moon.\n\n 54.\n And on a throne o'erlaid with starlight, caught\n Upon those wandering isles of aery dew,\n Which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not,               _475\n She sate, and heard all that had happened new\n Between the earth and moon, since they had brought\n The last intelligence--and now she grew\n Pale as that moon, lost in the watery night--\n And now she wept, and now she laughed outright.               _480\n\n 55.\n These were tame pleasures; she would often climb\n The steepest ladder of the crudded rack\n Up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime,\n And like Arion on the dolphin's back\n Ride singing through the shoreless air;--oft-time             _485\n Following the serpent lightning's winding track,\n She ran upon the platforms of the wind,\n And laughed to hear the fire-balls roar behind.\n\n 56.\n And sometimes to those streams of upper air\n Which whirl the earth in its diurnal round,                   _490\n She would ascend, and win the spirits there\n To let her join their chorus. Mortals found\n That on those days the sky was calm and fair,\n And mystic snatches of harmonious sound\n Wandered upon the earth where'er she passed,                  _495\n And happy thoughts of hope, too sweet to last.\n\n 57.\n But her choice sport was, in the hours of sleep,\n To glide adown old Nilus, where he threads\n Egypt and Aethiopia, from the steep\n Of utmost Axume, until he spreads,                            _500\n Like a calm flock of silver-fleeced sheep,\n His waters on the plain: and crested heads\n Of cities and proud temples gleam amid,\n And many a vapour-belted pyramid.\n\n 58.\n By Moeris and the Mareotid lakes,                             _505\n Strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors,\n Where naked boys bridling tame water-snakes,\n Or charioteering ghastly alligators,\n Had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes\n Of those huge forms--within the brazen doors                  _510\n Of the great Labyrinth slept both boy and beast,\n Tired with the pomp of their Osirian feast.\n\n 59.\n And where within the surface of the river\n The shadows of the massy temples lie,\n And never are erased--but tremble ever                        _515\n Like things which every cloud can doom to die,\n Through lotus-paven canals, and wheresoever\n The works of man pierced that serenest sky\n With tombs, and towers, and fanes, 'twas her delight\n To wander in the shadow of the night.                         _520\n\n 60.\n With motion like the spirit of that wind\n Whose soft step deepens slumber, her light feet\n Passed through the peopled haunts of humankind.\n Scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet,\n Through fane, and palace-court, and labyrinth mined           _525\n With many a dark and subterranean street\n Under the Nile, through chambers high and deep\n She passed, observing mortals in their sleep.\n\n 61.\n A pleasure sweet doubtless it was to see\n Mortals subdued in all the shapes of sleep.                   _530\n Here lay two sister twins in infancy;\n There, a lone youth who in his dreams did weep;\n Within, two lovers linked innocently\n In their loose locks which over both did creep\n Like ivy from one stem;--and there lay calm                   _535\n Old age with snow-bright hair and folded palm.\n\n 62.\n But other troubled forms of sleep she saw,\n Not to be mirrored in a holy song--\n Distortions foul of supernatural awe,\n And pale imaginings of visioned wrong;                        _540\n And all the code of Custom's lawless law\n Written upon the brows of old and young:\n 'This,' said the wizard maiden, 'is the strife\n Which stirs the liquid surface of man's life.'\n\n 63.\n And little did the sight disturb her soul.--                  _545\n We, the weak mariners of that wide lake\n Where'er its shores extend or billows roll,\n Our course unpiloted and starless make\n O'er its wild surface to an unknown goal:--\n But she in the calm depths her way could take,                _550\n Where in bright bowers immortal forms abide\n Beneath the weltering of the restless tide.\n\n 64.\n And she saw princes couched under the glow\n Of sunlike gems; and round each temple-court\n In dormitories ranged, row after row,                         _555\n She saw the priests asleep--all of one sort--\n For all were educated to be so.--\n The peasants in their huts, and in the port\n The sailors she saw cradled on the waves,\n And the dead lulled within their dreamless graves.            _560\n\n 65.\n And all the forms in which those spirits lay\n Were to her sight like the diaphanous\n Veils, in which those sweet ladies oft array\n Their delicate limbs, who would conceal from us\n Only their scorn of all concealment: they                     _565\n Move in the light of their own beauty thus.\n But these and all now lay with sleep upon them,\n And little thought a Witch was looking on them.\n\n 66.\n She, all those human figures breathing there,\n Beheld as living spirits--to her eyes                         _570\n The naked beauty of the soul lay bare,\n And often through a rude and worn disguise\n She saw the inner form most bright and fair--\n And then she had a charm of strange device,\n Which, murmured on mute lips with tender tone,                _575\n Could make that spirit mingle with her own.\n\n 67.\n Alas!

    "10pt\n1.10pt\n[ Characterizing Political Fake News in Twitter by its Meta-DataJulio Amador D\u00edaz L\u00f3pezAxel Oehmichen Miguel Molina-Solana( j.amador, axelfrancois.oehmichen11, mmolinas@imperial.ac.uk ) Imperial College London This article presents a preliminary approach towards characterizing political fake news on Twitter through the analysis of their meta-data. In particular, we focus on more than 1.5M tweets collected on the day of the election of Donald Trump as 45th president of the United States of America. We use the meta-data embedded within those tweets in order to look for differences between tweets containing fake news and tweets not containing them. Specifically, we perform our analysis only on tweets that went viral, by studying proxies for users' exposure to the tweets, by characterizing accounts spreading fake news, and by looking at their polarization. We found significant differences on the distribution of followers, the number of URLs on tweets, and the verification of the users.\n]\nIntroduction\nWhile fake news, understood as deliberately misleading pieces of information, have existed since long ago (e.g. it is not unusual to receive news falsely claiming the death of a celebrity), the term reached the mainstream, particularly so in politics, during the 2016 presidential election in the United States BIBREF0 . Since then, governments and corporations alike (e.g. Google BIBREF1 and Facebook BIBREF2 ) have begun efforts to tackle fake news as they can affect political decisions BIBREF3 . Yet, the ability to define, identify and stop fake news from spreading is limited.\nSince the Obama campaign in 2008, social media has been pervasive in the political arena in the United States. Studies report that up to 62% of American adults receive their news from social media BIBREF4 . The wide use of platforms such as Twitter and Facebook has facilitated the diffusion of fake news by simplifying the process of receiving content with no significant third party filtering, fact-checking or editorial judgement. Such characteristics make these platforms suitable means for sharing news that, disguised as legit ones, try to confuse readers.\nSuch use and their prominent rise has been confirmed by Craig Silverman, a Canadian journalist who is a prominent figure on fake news BIBREF5 : \u201cIn the final three months of the US presidential campaign, the top-performing fake election news stories on Facebook generated more engagement than the top stories from major news outlet\u201d.\nOur current research hence departs from the assumption that social media is a conduit for fake news and asks the question of whether fake news (as spam was some years ago) can be identified, modelled and eventually blocked. In order to do so, we use a sample of more that 1.5M tweets collected on November 8th 2016 \u2014election day in the United States\u2014 with the goal of identifying features that tweets containing fake news are likely to have. As such, our paper aims to provide a preliminary characterization of fake news in Twitter by looking into meta-data embedded in tweets. Considering meta-data as a relevant factor of analysis is in line with findings reported by Morris et al. BIBREF6 . We argue that understanding differences between tweets containing fake news and regular tweets will allow researchers to design mechanisms to block fake news in Twitter.\nSpecifically, our goals are: 1) compare the characteristics of tweets labelled as containing fake news to tweets labelled as not containing them, 2) characterize, through their meta-data, viral tweets containing fake news and the accounts from which they originated, and 3) determine the extent to which tweets containing fake news expressed polarized political views.\nFor our study, we used the number of retweets to single-out those that went viral within our sample. Tweets within that subset (viral tweets hereafter) are varied and relate to different topics. We consider that a tweet contains fake news if its text falls within any of the following categories described by Rubin et al. BIBREF7 (see next section for the details of such categories): serious fabrication, large-scale hoaxes, jokes taken at face value, slanted reporting of real facts and stories where the truth is contentious. The dataset BIBREF8 , manually labelled by an expert, has been publicly released and is available to researchers and interested parties.\nFrom our results, the following main observations can be made:\nOur findings resonate with similar work done on fake news such as the one from Allcot and Gentzkow BIBREF9 . Therefore, even if our study is a preliminary attempt at characterizing fake news on Twitter using only their meta-data, our results provide external validity to previous research. Moreover, our work not only stresses the importance of using meta-data, but also underscores which parameters may be useful to identify fake news on Twitter.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly discusses where this work is located within the literature on fake news and contextualizes the type of fake news we are studying. Then, we present our hypotheses, the data, and the methodology we follow. Finally, we present our findings, conclusions of this study, and future lines of work.\nDefining Fake news\nOur research is connected to different strands of academic knowledge related to the phenomenon of fake news. In relation to Computer Science, a recent survey by Conroy and colleagues BIBREF10 identifies two popular approaches to single-out fake news. On the one hand, the authors pointed to linguistic approaches consisting in using text, its linguistic characteristics and machine learning techniques to automatically flag fake news. On the other, these researchers underscored the use of network approaches, which make use of network characteristics and meta-data, to identify fake news.\nWith respect to social sciences, efforts from psychology, political science and sociology, have been dedicated to understand why people consume and/or believe misinformation BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 . Most of these studies consistently reported that psychological biases such as priming effects and confirmation bias play an important role in people ability to discern misinformation.\nIn relation to the production and distribution of fake news, a recent paper in the field of Economics BIBREF9 found that most fake news sites use names that resemble those of legitimate organizations, and that sites supplying fake news tend to be short-lived. These authors also noticed that fake news items are more likely shared than legitimate articles coming from trusted sources, and they tend to exhibit a larger level of polarization.\nThe conceptual issue of how to define fake news is a serious and unresolved issue. As the focus of our work is not attempting to offer light on this, we will rely on work by other authors to describe what we consider as fake news. In particular, we use the categorization provided by Rubin et al. BIBREF7 . The five categories they described, together with illustrative examples from our dataset, are as follows:\nResearch Hypotheses\nPrevious works on the area (presented in the section above) suggest that there may be important determinants for the adoption and diffusion of fake news. Our hypotheses builds on them and identifies three important dimensions that may help distinguishing fake news from legit information:\nTaking those three dimensions into account, we propose the following hypotheses about the features that we believe can help to identify tweets containing fake news from those not containing them. They will be later tested over our collected dataset.\nExposure.\nCharacterization.\nPolarization.\nData and Methodology\nFor this study, we collected publicly available tweets using Twitter's public API. Given the nature of the data, it is important to emphasize that such tweets are subject to Twitter's terms and conditions which indicate that users consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, and disclosure of data. Therefore, we do not expect ethical, legal, or social implications from the usage of the tweets. Our data was collected using search terms related to the presidential election held in the United States on November 8th 2016. Particularly, we queried Twitter's streaming API, more precisely the filter endpoint of the streaming API, using the following hashtags and user handles: #MyVote2016, #ElectionDay, #electionnight, @realDonaldTrump and @HillaryClinton. The data collection ran for just one day (Nov 8th 2016).\nOne straightforward way of sharing information on Twitter is by using the retweet functionality, which enables a user to share a exact copy of a tweet with his followers. Among the reasons for retweeting, Body et al. BIBREF15 reported the will to: 1) spread tweets to a new audience, 2) to show one\u2019s role as a listener, and 3) to agree with someone or validate the thoughts of others. As indicated, our initial interest is to characterize tweets containing fake news that went viral (as they are the most harmful ones, as they reach a wider audience), and understand how it differs from other viral tweets (that do not contain fake news). For our study, we consider that a tweet went viral if it was retweeted more than 1000 times.\nOnce we have the dataset of viral tweets, we eliminated duplicates (some of the tweets were collected several times because they had several handles) and an expert manually inspected the text field within the tweets to label them as containing fake news, or not containing them (according to the characterization presented before). This annotated dataset BIBREF8 is publicly available and can be freely reused.\nFinally, we use the following fields within tweets (from the ones returned by Twitter's API) to compare their distributions and look for differences between viral tweets containing fake news and viral tweets not containing fake news:\nIn the following section, we provide graphical descriptions of the distribution of each of the identified attributes for the two sets of tweets (those labelled as containing fake news and those labelled as not containing them). Where appropriate, we normalized and/or took logarithms of the data for better representation. To gain a better understanding of the significance of those differences, we use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with the null hypothesis that both distributions are equal.\nResults\nThe sample collected consisted on 1 785 855 tweets published by 848 196 different users. Within our sample, we identified 1327 tweets that went viral (retweeted more than 1000 times by the 8th of November 2016) produced by 643 users. Such small subset of viral tweets were retweeted on 290 841 occasions in the observed time-window.\nThe 1327 `viral' tweets were manually annotated as containing fake news or not. The annotation was carried out by a single person in order to obtain a consistent annotation throughout the dataset. Out of those 1327 tweets, we identified 136 as potentially containing fake news (according to the categories previously described), and the rest were classified as `non containing fake news'. Note that the categorization is far from being perfect given the ambiguity of fake news themselves and human judgement involved in the process of categorization. Because of this, we do not claim that this dataset can be considered a ground truth.\nThe following results detail characteristics of these tweets along the previously mentioned dimensions. Table TABREF23 reports the actual differences (together with their associated p-values) of the distributions of viral tweets containing fake news and viral tweets not containing them for every variable considered.\nExposure\nFigure FIGREF24 shows that, in contrast to other kinds of viral tweets, those containing fake news were created more recently. As such, Twitter users were exposed to fake news related to the election for a shorter period of time.\nHowever, in terms of retweets, Figure FIGREF25 shows no apparent difference between containing fake news or not containing them. That is confirmed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test, which does not discard the hypothesis that the associated distributions are equal.\nIn relation to the number of favourites, users that generated at least a viral tweet containing fake news appear to have, on average, less favourites than users that do not generate them. Figure FIGREF26 shows the distribution of favourites. Despite the apparent visual differences, the difference are not statistically significant.\nFinally, the number of hashtags used in viral fake news appears to be larger than those in other viral tweets. Figure FIGREF27 shows the density distribution of the number of hashtags used. However, once again, we were not able to find any statistical difference between the average number of hashtags in a viral tweet and the average number of hashtags in viral fake news.\nCharacterization\nWe found that 82 users within our sample were spreading fake news (i.e. they produced at least one tweet which was labelled as fake news). Out of those, 34 had verified accounts, and the rest were unverified. From the 48 unverified accounts, 6 have been suspended by Twitter at the date of writing, 3 tried to imitate legitimate accounts of others, and 4 accounts have been already deleted. Figure FIGREF28 shows the proportion of verified accounts to unverified accounts for viral tweets (containing fake news vs. not containing fake news). From the chart, it is clear that there is a higher chance of fake news coming from unverified accounts.\nTurning to friends, accounts distributing fake news appear to have, on average, the same number of friends than those distributing tweets with no fake news. However, the density distribution of friends from the accounts (Figure FIGREF29 ) shows that there is indeed a statistically significant difference in their distributions.\nIf we take into consideration the number of followers, accounts generating viral tweets with fake news do have a very different distribution on this dimension, compared to those accounts generating viral tweets with no fake news (see Figure FIGREF30 ). In fact, such differences are statistically significant.\nA useful representation for friends and followers is the ratio between friends/followers. Figures FIGREF31 and FIGREF32 show this representation. Notice that accounts spreading viral tweets with fake news have, on average, a larger ratio of friends/followers. The distribution of those accounts not generating fake news is more evenly distributed.\nWith respect to the number of mentions, Figure FIGREF33 shows that viral tweets labelled as containing fake news appear to use mentions to other users less frequently than viral tweets not containing fake news. In other words, tweets containing fake news mostly contain 1 mention, whereas other tweets tend to have two). Such differences are statistically significant.\nThe analysis (Figure FIGREF34 ) of the presence of media in the tweets in our dataset shows that tweets labelled as not containing fake news appear to present more media elements than those labelled as fake news. However, the difference is not statistically significant.\nOn the other hand, Figure FIGREF35 shows that viral tweets containing fake news appear to include more URLs to other sites than viral tweets that do not contain fake news. In fact, the difference between the two distributions is statistically significant (assuming INLINEFORM0 ).\nPolarization\nFinally, manual inspection of the text field of those viral tweets labelled as containing fake news shows that 117 of such tweets expressed support for Donald Trump, while only 8 supported Hillary Clinton. The remaining tweets contained fake news related to other topics, not expressing support for any of the candidates.\nDiscussion\nAs a summary, and constrained by our existing dataset, we made the following observations regarding differences between viral tweets labelled as containing fake news and viral tweets labelled as not containing them:\nThese findings (related to our initial hypothesis in Table TABREF44 ) clearly suggest that there are specific pieces of meta-data about tweets that may allow the identification of fake news. One such parameter is the time of exposure. Viral tweets containing fake news are shorter-lived than those containing other type of content. This notion seems to resonate with our findings showing that a number of accounts spreading fake news have already been deleted or suspended by Twitter by the time of writing. If one considers that researchers using different data have found similar results BIBREF9 , it appears that the lifetime of accounts, together with the age of the questioned viral content could be useful to identify fake news. In the light of this finding, accounts newly created should probably put under higher scrutiny than older ones. This in fact, would be a nice a-priori bias for a Bayesian classifier.\nAccounts spreading fake news appear to have a larger proportion of friends/followers (i.e. they have, on average, the same number of friends but a smaller number of followers) than those spreading viral content only. Together with the fact that, on average, tweets containing fake news have more URLs than those spreading viral content, it is possible to hypothesize that, both, the ratio of friends/followers of the account producing a viral tweet and number of URLs contained in such a tweet could be useful to single-out fake news in Twitter. Not only that, but our finding related to the number of URLs is in line with intuitions behind the incentives to create fake news commonly found in the literature BIBREF9 (in particular that of obtaining revenue through click-through advertising).\nFinally, it is interesting to notice that the content of viral fake news was highly polarized. This finding is also in line with those of Alcott et al. BIBREF9 . This feature suggests that textual sentiment analysis of the content of tweets (as most researchers do), together with the above mentioned parameters from meta-data, may prove useful for identifying fake news.\nConclusions\nWith the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, the concept of fake news has become a broadly-known phenomenon that is getting tremendous attention from governments and media companies. We have presented a preliminary study on the meta-data of a publicly available dataset of tweets that became viral during the day of the 2016 US presidential election. Our aim is to advance the understanding of which features might be characteristic of viral tweets containing fake news in comparison with viral tweets without fake news.\nWe believe that the only way to automatically identify those deceitful tweets (i.e. containing fake news) is by actually understanding and modelling them. Only then, the automation of the processes of tagging and blocking these tweets can be successfully performed. In the same way that spam was fought, we anticipate fake news will suffer a similar evolution, with social platforms implementing tools to deal with them. With most works so far focusing on the actual content of the tweets, ours is a novel attempt from a different, but also complementary, angle.\nWithin the used dataset, we found there are differences around exposure, characteristics of accounts spreading fake news and the tone of the content. Those findings suggest that it is indeed possible to model and automatically detect fake news. We plan to replicate and validate our experiments in an extended sample of tweets (until 4 months after the US election), and tests the predictive power of the features we found relevant within our sample.\nAuthor Disclosure Statement\nNo competing financial interest exist.",
    "INTRODUCTION\nThe idea of language identification is to classify a given audio signal into a particular class using a classification algorithm. Commonly language identification task was done using i-vector systems [1]. A very well known approach for language identification proposed by N. Dahek et al. [1] uses the GMM-UBM model to obtain utterance level features called i-vectors. Recent advances in deep learning [15,16] have helped to improve the language identification task using many different neural network architectures which can be trained efficiently using GPUs for large scale datasets. These neural networks can be configured in various ways to obtain better accuracy for language identification task. Early work on using Deep learning for language Identification was published by Pavel Matejka et al. [2], where they used stacked bottleneck features extracted from deep neural networks for language identification task and showed that the bottleneck features learned by Deep neural networks are better than simple MFCC or PLP features. Later the work by I. Lopez-Moreno et al. [3] from Google showed how to use Deep neural networks to directly map the sequence of MFCC frames into its language class so that we can apply language identification at the frame level. Speech signals will have both spatial and temporal information, but simple DNNs are not able to capture temporal information. Work done by J. Gonzalez-Dominguez et al. [4] by Google developed an LSTM based language identification model which improves the accuracy over the DNN based models. Work done by Alicia et al. [5] used CNNs to improve upon i-vector [1] and other previously developed systems. The work done by Daniel Garcia-Romero et al. [6] has used a combination of Acoustic model trained for speech recognition with Time-delay neural networks where they train the TDNN model by feeding the stacked bottleneck features from acoustic model to predict the language labels at the frame level. Recently X-vectors [7] is proposed for speaker identification task and are shown to outperform all the previous state of the art speaker identification algorithms and are also used for language identification by David Snyder et al. [8].\nIn this paper, we explore multiple pooling strategies for language identification task. Mainly we propose Ghost-VLAD based pooling method for language identification. Inspired by the recent work by W. Xie et al. [9] and Y. Zhong et al. [10], we use Ghost-VLAD to improve the accuracy of language identification task for Indian languages. We explore multiple pooling strategies including NetVLAD pooling [11], Average pooling and Statistics pooling( as proposed in X-vectors [7]) and show that Ghost-VLAD pooling is the best pooling strategy for language identification. Our model obtains the best accuracy of 98.24%, and it outperforms all the other previously proposed pooling methods. We conduct all our experiments on 635hrs of audio data for 7 Indian languages collected from $\\textbf {All India Radio}$ news channel. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we explain the proposed pooling method for language identification. In section 3, we explain our dataset. In section 4, we describe the experiments, and in section 5, we describe the results.\nPOOLING STRATEGIES\nIn any language identification model, we want to obtain utterance level representation which has very good language discriminative features. These representations should be compact and should be easily separable by a linear classifier. The idea of any pooling strategy is to pool the frame-level representations into a single utterance level representation. Previous works by [7] have used simple mean and standard deviation aggregation to pool the frame-level features from the top layer of the neural network to obtain the utterance level features. Recently [9] used VLAD based pooling strategy for speaker identification which is inspired from [10] proposed for face recognition. The NetVLAD [11] and Ghost-VLAD [10] methods are proposed for Place recognition and face recognition, respectively, and in both cases, they try to aggregate the local descriptors into global features. In our case, the local descriptors are features extracted from ResNet [15], and the global utterance level feature is obtained by using GhostVLAD pooling. In this section, we explain different pooling methods, including NetVLAD, Ghost-VLAD, Statistic pooling, and Average pooling.\nPOOLING STRATEGIES ::: NetVLAD pooling\nThe NetVLAD pooling strategy was initially developed for place recognition by R. Arandjelovic et al. [11]. The NetVLAD is an extension to VLAD [18] approach where they were able to replace the hard assignment based clustering with soft assignment based clustering so that it can be trained with neural network in an end to end fashion. In our case, we use the NetVLAD layer to map N local features of dimension D into a fixed dimensional vector, as shown in Figure 1 (Left side).\nThe model takes spectrogram as an input and feeds into CNN based ResNet architecture. The ResNet is used to map the spectrogram into 3D feature map of dimension HxWxD. We convert this 3D feature map into 2D by unfolding H and W dimensions, creating a NxD dimensional feature map, where N=HxW. The NetVLAD layer is kept on top of the feature extraction layer of ResNet, as shown in Figure 1. The NetVLAD now takes N features vectors of dimension D and computes a matrix V of dimension KxD, where K is the number clusters in the NetVLAD layer, and D is the dimension of the feature vector. The matrix V is computed as follows.\nWhere $w_k$,$b_k$ and $c_k$ are trainable parameters for the cluster $k$ and V(j,k) represents a point in the V matrix for (j,k)th location. The matrix is constructed using the equation (1) where the first term corresponds to the soft assignment of the input $x_i$ to the cluster $c_k$, whereas the second term corresponds to the residual term which tells how far the input descriptor $x_i$ is from the cluster center $c_k$.\nPOOLING STRATEGIES ::: GhostVLAD pooling\nGhostVLAD is an extension of the NetVLAD approach, which we discussed in the previous section. The GhostVLAD model was proposed for face recognition by Y. Zhong [10]. GhostVLAD works exactly similar to NetVLAD except it adds Ghost clusters along with the NetVLAD clusters. So, now we will have a K+G number of clusters instead of K clusters. Where G is the number of ghost clusters, we want to add (typically 2-4). The Ghost clusters are added to map any noisy or irrelevant content into ghost clusters and are not included during the feature aggregation stage, as shown in Figure 1 (Right side). Which means that we compute the matrix V for both normal cluster K and ghost clusters G, but we will not include the vectors belongs to ghost cluster from V during concatenation of the features. Due to which, during feature aggregation stage the contribution of the noisy and unwanted features to normal VLAD clusters are assigned less weights while Ghost clusters absorb most of the weight. We illustrate this in Figure 1(Right Side), where the ghost clusters are shown in red color. We use Ghost clusters when we are computing the V matrix, but they are excluded during the concatenation stage. These concatenated features are fed into the projection layer, followed by softmax to predict the language label.\nPOOLING STRATEGIES ::: Statistic and average pooling\nIn statistic pooling, we compute the first and second order statistics of the local features from the top layer of the ResNet model. The 3-D feature map is unfolded to create N features of D dimensions, and then we compute the mean and standard deviation of all these N vectors and get two D dimensional vectors, one for mean and the other for standard deviation. We then concatenate these 2 features and feed it to the projection layer for predicting the language label.\nIn the Average pooling layer, we compute only the first-order statistics (mean) of the local features from the top layer of the CNN model. The feature map from the top layer of CNN is unfolded to create N features of D dimensions, and then we compute the mean of all these N vectors and get D dimensional representation. We then feed this feature to the projection layer followed by softmax for predicting the language label.\nDATASET\nIn this section, we describe our dataset collection process. We collected and curated around 635Hrs of audio data for 7 Indian languages, namely Kannada, Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, and English. We collected the data from the All India Radio news channel where an actor will be reading news for about 5-10 mins. To cover many speakers for the dataset, we crawled data from 2010 to 2019. Since the audio is very long to train any deep neural network directly, we segment the audio clips into smaller chunks using Voice activity detector. Since the audio clips will have music embedded during the news, we use Inhouse music detection model to remove the music segments from the dataset to make the dataset clean and our dataset contains 635Hrs of clean audio which is divided into 520Hrs of training data containing 165K utterances and 115Hrs of testing data containing 35K utterances. The amount of audio data for training and testing for each of the language is shown in the table bellow.\nEXPERIMENTS\nIn this section, we describe the feature extraction process and network architecture in detail. We use spectral features of 256 dimensions computed using 512 point FFT for every frame, and we add an energy feature for every frame giving us total 257 features for every frame. We use a window size of 25ms and frame shift of 10ms during feature computation. We crop random 5sec audio data from each utterance during training which results in a spectrogram of size 257x500 (features x number of features). We use these spectrograms as input to our CNN model during training. During testing, we compute the prediction score irrespective of the audio length.\nFor the network architecture, we use ResNet-34 architecture, as described in [9]. The model uses convolution layers with Relu activations to map the spectrogram of size 257x500 input into 3D feature map of size 1x32x512. This feature cube is converted into 2D feature map of dimension 32x512 and fed into Ghost-VLAD/NetVLAD layer to generate a representation that has more language discrimination capacity. We use Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a final learning rate of 0.00001 for training. Each model is trained for 15 epochs with early stopping criteria.\nFor the baseline, we train an i-vector model using GMM-UBM. We fit a small classifier on top of the generated i-vectors to measure the accuracy. This model is referred as i-vector+svm . To compare our model with the previous state of the art system, we set up the x-vector language identification system [8]. The x-vector model used time-delay neural networks (TDNN) along with statistic-pooling. We use 7 layer TDNN architecture similar to [8] for training. We refer to this model as tdnn+stat-pool . Finally, we set up a Deep LSTM based language identification system similar to [4] but with little modification where we add statistics pooling for the last layers hidden activities before classification. We use 3 layer Bi-LSTM with 256 hidden units at each layer. We refer to this model as LSTM+stat-pool. We train our i-vector+svm and TDNN+stat-pool using Kaldi toolkit. We train our NetVLAD and GhostVLAD experiments using Keras by modifying the code given by [9] for language identification. We train the LSTM+stat-pool and the remaining experiments using Pytorch [14] toolkit, and we will opensource all the codes and data soon.\nRESULTS\nIn this section, we compare the performance of our system with the recent state of the art language identification approaches. We also compare different pooling strategies and finally, compare the robustness of our system to the length of the input spectrogram during training. We visualize the embeddings generated by the GhostVLAD method and conclude that the GhostVLAD embeddings shows very good feature discrimination capabilities.\nRESULTS ::: Comparison with different approaches\nWe compare our system performance with the previous state of the art language identification approaches, as shown in Table 2. The i-vector+svm system is trained using GMM-UBM models to generate i-vectors as proposed in [1]. Once the i-vectors are extracted, we fit SVM classifier to classify the audio. The TDNN+stat-pool system is trained with a statistics pooling layer and is called the x-vector system as proposed by David Snyder et al. [11] and is currently the state of the art language identification approach as far as our knowledge. Our methods outperform the state of the art x-vector system by absolute 1.88% improvement in F1-score, as shown in Table 2.\nRESULTS ::: Comparison with different pooling techniques\nWe compare our approach with different pooling strategies in Table 3. We use ResNet as our base feature extraction network. We keep the base network the same and change only the pooling layers to see which pooling approach performs better for language identification task. Our experiments show that GhostVLAD pooling outperforms all the other pooling methods by achieving 98.43% F1-Score.\nRESULTS ::: Duration analysis\nTo observe the performance of our method with different input durations, we conducted an experiment where we train our model on different input durations. Since our model uses ResNet as the base feature extractor, we need to feed fixed-length spectrogram. We conducted 4 different experiments where we trained the model using 2sec, 3sec, 4sec and 5sec spectrograms containing 200,300,400 and 500 frames respectively. We observed that the model trained with a 5sec spectrogram is the best model, as shown in Table 4.\nRESULTS ::: Visualization of embeddings\nWe visualize the embeddings generated by our approach to see the effectiveness. We extracted 512-dimensional embeddings for our testing data and reduced the dimensionality using t-sne projection. The t-sne plot of the embeddings space is shown in Figure 3. The plot shows that the embeddings learned by our approach has very good discriminative properties\nConclusion\nIn this work, we use Ghost-VLAD pooling approach that was originally proposed for face recognition to improve language identification performance for Indian languages. We collected and curated 630 hrs audio data from news All India Radio news channel for 7 Indian languages. Our experimental results shows that our approach outperforms the previous state of the art methods by an absolute 1.88% F1-score. We have also conducted experiments with different pooling strategies proposed in the past, and the GhostVLAD pooling approach turns out to be the best approach for aggregating frame-level features into a single utterance level feature. Our experiments also prove that our approach works much better even if the input during training contains smaller durations. Finally, we see that the embeddings generated by our method has very good language discriminative features and helps to improve the performance of language identification.",
    "Introduction\nRecently, deep learning algorithms have successfully addressed problems in various fields, such as image classification, machine translation, speech recognition, text-to-speech generation and other machine learning related areas BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 . Similarly, substantial improvements in performance have been obtained when deep learning algorithms have been applied to statistical speech processing BIBREF3 . These fundamental improvements have led researchers to investigate additional topics related to human nature, which have long been objects of study. One such topic involves understanding human emotions and reflecting it through machine intelligence, such as emotional dialogue models BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 .\nIn developing emotionally aware intelligence, the very first step is building robust emotion classifiers that display good performance regardless of the application; this outcome is considered to be one of the fundamental research goals in affective computing BIBREF6 . In particular, the speech emotion recognition task is one of the most important problems in the field of paralinguistics. This field has recently broadened its applications, as it is a crucial factor in optimal human-computer interactions, including dialog systems. The goal of speech emotion recognition is to predict the emotional content of speech and to classify speech according to one of several labels (i.e., happy, sad, neutral, and angry). Various types of deep learning methods have been applied to increase the performance of emotion classifiers; however, this task is still considered to be challenging for several reasons. First, insufficient data for training complex neural network-based models are available, due to the costs associated with human involvement. Second, the characteristics of emotions must be learned from low-level speech signals. Feature-based models display limited skills when applied to this problem.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a model that uses high-level text transcription, as well as low-level audio signals, to utilize the information contained within low-resource datasets to a greater degree. Given recent improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology BIBREF7 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , speech transcription can be carried out using audio signals with considerable skill. The emotional content of speech is clearly indicated by the emotion words contained in a sentence BIBREF10 , such as \u201clovely\u201d and \u201cawesome,\u201d which carry strong emotions compared to generic (non-emotion) words, such as \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cday.\u201d Thus, we hypothesize that the speech emotion recognition model will be benefit from the incorporation of high-level textual input.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel deep dual recurrent encoder model that simultaneously utilizes audio and text data in recognizing emotions from speech. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate the efficacy and properties of the proposed model. Our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 68.8% to 71.8% when applied to the IEMOCAP dataset, which is one of the most well-studied datasets. Based on an error analysis of the models, we show that our proposed model accurately identifies emotion classes. Moreover, the neutral class misclassification bias frequently exhibited by previous models, which focus on audio features, is less pronounced in our model.\nRelated work\nClassical machine learning algorithms, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), support vector machines (SVMs), and decision tree-based methods, have been employed in speech emotion recognition problems BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 . Recently, researchers have proposed various neural network-based architectures to improve the performance of speech emotion recognition. An initial study utilized deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract high-level features from raw audio data and demonstrated its effectiveness in speech emotion recognition BIBREF14 . With the advancement of deep learning methods, more complex neural-based architectures have been proposed. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models have been trained on information derived from raw audio signals using spectrograms or audio features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and low-level descriptors (LLDs) BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 . These neural network-based models are combined to produce higher-complexity models BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , and these models achieved the best-recorded performance when applied to the IEMOCAP dataset.\nAnother line of research has focused on adopting variant machine learning techniques combined with neural network-based models. One researcher utilized the multiobject learning approach and used gender and naturalness as auxiliary tasks so that the neural network-based model learned more features from a given dataset BIBREF20 . Another researcher investigated transfer learning methods, leveraging external data from related domains BIBREF21 .\nAs emotional dialogue is composed of sound and spoken content, researchers have also investigated the combination of acoustic features and language information, built belief network-based methods of identifying emotional key phrases, and assessed the emotional salience of verbal cues from both phoneme sequences and words BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 . However, none of these studies have utilized information from speech signals and text sequences simultaneously in an end-to-end learning neural network-based model to classify emotions.\nModel\nThis section describes the methodologies that are applied to the speech emotion recognition task. We start by introducing the recurrent encoder model for the audio and text modalities individually. We then propose a multimodal approach that encodes both audio and textual information simultaneously via a dual recurrent encoder.\nAudio Recurrent Encoder (ARE)\nMotivated by the architecture used in BIBREF24 , BIBREF25 , we build an audio recurrent encoder (ARE) to predict the class of a given audio signal. Once MFCC features have been extracted from an audio signal, a subset of the sequential features is fed into the RNN (i.e., gated recurrent units (GRUs)), which leads to the formation of the network's internal hidden state INLINEFORM0 to model the time series patterns. This internal hidden state is updated at each time step with the input data INLINEFORM1 and the hidden state of the previous time step INLINEFORM2 as follows: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the RNN function with weight parameter INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 represents the hidden state at t- INLINEFORM3 time step, and INLINEFORM4 represents the t- INLINEFORM5 MFCC features in INLINEFORM6 . After encoding the audio signal INLINEFORM7 with the RNN, the last hidden state of the RNN, INLINEFORM8 , is considered to be the representative vector that contains all of the sequential audio data. This vector is then concatenated with another prosodic feature vector, INLINEFORM9 , to generate a more informative vector representation of the signal, INLINEFORM10 . The MFCC and the prosodic features are extracted from the audio signal using the openSMILE toolkit BIBREF26 , INLINEFORM11 , respectively. Finally, the emotion class is predicted by applying the softmax function to the vector INLINEFORM12 . For a given audio sample INLINEFORM13 , we assume that INLINEFORM14 is the true label vector, which contains all zeros but contains a one at the correct class, and INLINEFORM15 is the predicted probability distribution from the softmax layer. The training objective then takes the following form: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the calculated representative vector of the audio signal with dimensionality INLINEFORM1 . The INLINEFORM2 and the bias INLINEFORM3 are learned model parameters. C is the total number of classes, and N is the total number of samples used in training. The upper part of Figure shows the architecture of the ARE model.\nText Recurrent Encoder (TRE)\nWe assume that speech transcripts can be extracted from audio signals with high accuracy, given the advancement of ASR technologies BIBREF7 . We attempt to use the processed textual information as another modality in predicting the emotion class of a given signal. To use textual information, a speech transcript is tokenized and indexed into a sequence of tokens using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) BIBREF27 . Each token is then passed through a word-embedding layer that converts a word index to a corresponding 300-dimensional vector that contains additional contextual meaning between words. The sequence of embedded tokens is fed into a text recurrent encoder (TRE) in such a way that the audio MFCC features are encoded using the ARE represented by equation EQREF2 . In this case, INLINEFORM0 is the t- INLINEFORM1 embedded token from the text input. Finally, the emotion class is predicted from the last hidden state of the text-RNN using the softmax function.\nWe use the same training objective as the ARE model, and the predicted probability distribution for the target class is as follows: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is last hidden state of the text-RNN, INLINEFORM1 , and the INLINEFORM2 and bias INLINEFORM3 are learned model parameters. The lower part of Figure indicates the architecture of the TRE model.\nMultimodal Dual Recurrent Encoder (MDRE)\nWe present a novel architecture called the multimodal dual recurrent encoder (MDRE) to overcome the limitations of existing approaches. In this study, we consider multiple modalities, such as MFCC features, prosodic features and transcripts, which contain sequential audio information, statistical audio information and textual information, respectively. These types of data are the same as those used in the ARE and TRE cases. The MDRE model employs two RNNs to encode data from the audio signal and textual inputs independently. The audio-RNN encodes MFCC features from the audio signal using equation EQREF2 . The last hidden state of the audio-RNN is concatenated with the prosodic features to form the final vector representation INLINEFORM0 , and this vector is then passed through a fully connected neural network layer to form the audio encoding vector A. On the other hand, the text-RNN encodes the word sequence of the transcript using equation EQREF2 . The final hidden states of the text-RNN are also passed through another fully connected neural network layer to form a textual encoding vector T. Finally, the emotion class is predicted by applying the softmax function to the concatenation of the vectors A and T. We use the same training objective as the ARE model, and the predicted probability distribution for the target class is as follows: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the feed-forward neural network with weight parameter INLINEFORM1 , and INLINEFORM2 , INLINEFORM3 are final encoding vectors from the audio-RNN and text-RNN, respectively. INLINEFORM4 and the bias INLINEFORM5 are learned model parameters.\nMultimodal Dual Recurrent Encoder with Attention (MDREA)\nInspired by the concept of the attention mechanism used in neural machine translation BIBREF28 , we propose a novel multimodal attention method to focus on the specific parts of a transcript that contain strong emotional information, conditioning on the audio information. Figure shows the architecture of the MDREA model. First, the audio data and text data are encoded with the audio-RNN and text-RNN using equation EQREF2 . We then consider the final audio encoding vector INLINEFORM0 as a context vector. As seen in equation EQREF9 , during each time step t, the dot product between the context vector e and the hidden state of the text-RNN at each t-th sequence INLINEFORM1 is evaluated to calculate a similarity score INLINEFORM2 . Using this score INLINEFORM3 as a weight parameter, the weighted sum of the sequences of the hidden state of the text-RNN, INLINEFORM4 , is calculated to generate an attention-application vector Z. This attention-application vector is concatenated with the final encoding vector of the audio-RNN INLINEFORM5 (equation EQREF7 ), which will be passed through the softmax function to predict the emotion class. We use the same training objective as the ARE model, and the predicted probability distribution for the target class is as follows: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 and the bias INLINEFORM1 are learned model parameters.\nDataset\nWe evaluate our model using the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) BIBREF18 dataset. This dataset was collected following theatrical theory in order to simulate natural dyadic interactions between actors. We use categorical evaluations with majority agreement. We use only four emotional categories happy, sad, angry, and neutral to compare the performance of our model with other research using the same categories. The IEMOCAP dataset includes five sessions, and each session contains utterances from two speakers (one male and one female). This data collection process resulted in 10 unique speakers. For consistent comparison with previous work, we merge the excitement dataset with the happiness dataset. The final dataset contains a total of 5531 utterances (1636 happy, 1084 sad, 1103 angry, 1708 neutral).\nFeature extraction\nTo extract speech information from audio signals, we use MFCC values, which are widely used in analyzing audio signals. The MFCC feature set contains a total of 39 features, which include 12 MFCC parameters (1-12) from the 26 Mel-frequency bands and log-energy parameters, 13 delta and 13 acceleration coefficients The frame size is set to 25 ms at a rate of 10 ms with the Hamming function. According to the length of each wave file, the sequential step of the MFCC features is varied. To extract additional information from the data, we also use prosodic features, which show effectiveness in affective computing. The prosodic features are composed of 35 features, which include the F0 frequency, the voicing probability, and the loudness contours. All of these MFCC and prosodic features are extracted from the data using the OpenSMILE toolkit BIBREF26 .\nImplementation details\nAmong the variants of the RNN function, we use GRUs as they yield comparable performance to that of the LSTM and include a smaller number of weight parameters BIBREF29 . We use a max encoder step of 750 for the audio input, based on the implementation choices presented in BIBREF30 and 128 for the text input because it covers the maximum length of the transcripts. The vocabulary size of the dataset is 3,747, including the \u201c_UNK_\" token, which represents unknown words, and the \u201c_PAD_\" token, which is used to indicate padding information added while preparing mini-batch data. The number of hidden units and the number of layers in the RNN for each model (ARE, TRE, MDRE and MDREA) are selected based on extensive hyperparameter search experiments. The weights of the hidden units are initialized using orthogonal weights BIBREF31 ], and the text embedding layer is initialized from pretrained word-embedding vectors BIBREF32 .\nIn preparing the textual dataset, we first use the released transcripts of the IEMOCAP dataset for simplicity. To investigate the practical performance, we then process all of the IEMOCAP audio data using an ASR system (the Google Cloud Speech API) and retrieve the transcripts. The performance of the Google ASR system is reflected by its word error rate (WER) of 5.53%.\nPerformance evaluation\nAs the dataset is not explicitly split beforehand into training, development, and testing sets, we perform 5-fold cross validation to determine the overall performance of the model. The data in each fold are split into training, development, and testing datasets (8:0.5:1.5, respectively). After training the model, we measure the weighted average precision (WAP) over the 5-fold dataset. We train and evaluate the model 10 times per fold, and the model performance is assessed in terms of the mean score and standard deviation.\nWe examine the WAP values, which are shown in Table 1. First, our ARE model shows the baseline performance because we use minimal audio features, such as the MFCC and prosodic features with simple architectures. On the other hand, the TRE model shows higher performance gain compared to the ARE. From this result, we note that textual data are informative in emotion prediction tasks, and the recurrent encoder model is effective in understanding these types of sequential data. Second, the newly proposed model, MDRE, shows a substantial performance gain. It thus achieves the state-of-the-art performance with a WAP value of 0.718. This result shows that multimodal information is a key factor in affective computing. Lastly, the attention model, MDREA, also outperforms the best existing research results (WAP 0.690 to 0.688) BIBREF19 . However, the MDREA model does not match the performance of the MDRE model, even though it utilizes a more complex architecture. We believe that this result arises because insufficient data are available to properly determine the complex model parameters in the MDREA model. Moreover, we presume that this model will show better performance when the audio signals are aligned with the textual sequence while applying the attention mechanism. We leave the implementation of this point as a future research direction.\nTo investigate the practical performance of the proposed models, we conduct further experiments with the ASR-processed transcript data (see \u201c-ASR\u201d models in Table ). The label accuracy of the processed transcripts is 5.53% WER. The TRE-ASR, MDRE-ASR and MDREA-ASR models reflect degraded performance compared to that of the TRE, MDRE and MDREA models. However, the performance of these models is still competitive; in particular, the MDRE-ASR model outperforms the previous best-performing model, 3CNN-LSTM10H (WAP 0.691 to 0.688).\nError analysis\nWe analyze the predictions of the ARE, TRE, and MDRE models. Figure shows the confusion matrix of each model. The ARE model (Fig. ) incorrectly classifies most instances of happy as neutral (43.51%); thus, it shows reduced accuracy (35.15%) in predicting the the happy class. Overall, most of the emotion classes are frequently confused with the neutral class. This observation is in line with the findings of BIBREF30 , who noted that the neutral class is located in the center of the activation-valence space, complicating its discrimination from the other classes.\nInterestingly, the TRE model (Fig. ) shows greater prediction gains in predicting the happy class when compared to the ARE model (35.15% to 75.73%). This result seems plausible because the model can benefit from the differences among the distributions of words in happy and neutral expressions, which gives more emotional information to the model than that of the audio signal data. On the other hand, it is striking that the TRE model incorrectly predicts instances of the sad class as the happy class 16.20% of the time, even though these emotional states are opposites of one another.\nThe MDRE model (Fig. ) compensates for the weaknesses of the previous two models (ARE and TRE) and benefits from their strengths to a surprising degree. The values arranged along the diagonal axis show that all of the accuracies of the correctly predicted class have increased. Furthermore, the occurrence of the incorrect \u201csad-to-happy\" cases in the TRE model is reduced from 16.20% to 9.15%.\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we propose a novel multimodal dual recurrent encoder model that simultaneously utilizes text data, as well as audio signals, to permit the better understanding of speech data. Our model encodes the information from audio and text sequences using dual RNNs and then combines the information from these sources using a feed-forward neural model to predict the emotion class. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in classifying the four emotion categories, and accuracies ranging from 68.8% to 71.8% are obtained when the model is applied to the IEMOCAP dataset. In particular, it resolves the issue in which predictions frequently incorrectly yield the neutral class, as occurs in previous models that focus on audio features.\nIn the future work, we aim to extend the modalities to audio, text and video inputs. Furthermore, we plan to investigate the application of the attention mechanism to data derived from multiple modalities. This approach seems likely to uncover enhanced learning schemes that will increase performance in both speech emotion recognition and other multimodal classification tasks.\nAcknowledgments\nK.

    "Introduction\nAbusive language refers to any type of insult, vulgarity, or profanity that debases the target; it also can be anything that causes aggravation BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 . Abusive language is often reframed as, but not limited to, offensive language BIBREF2 , cyberbullying BIBREF3 , othering language BIBREF4 , and hate speech BIBREF5 .\nRecently, an increasing number of users have been subjected to harassment, or have witnessed offensive behaviors online BIBREF6 . Major social media companies (i.e. Facebook, Twitter) have utilized multiple resources\u2014artificial intelligence, human reviewers, user reporting processes, etc.\u2014in effort to censor offensive language, yet it seems nearly impossible to successfully resolve the issue BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 .\nThe major reason of the failure in abusive language detection comes from its subjectivity and context-dependent characteristics BIBREF9 . For instance, a message can be regarded as harmless on its own, but when taking previous threads into account it may be seen as abusive, and vice versa. This aspect makes detecting abusive language extremely laborious even for human annotators; therefore it is difficult to build a large and reliable dataset BIBREF10 .\nPreviously, datasets openly available in abusive language detection research on Twitter ranged from 10K to 35K in size BIBREF9 , BIBREF11 . This quantity is not sufficient to train the significant number of parameters in deep learning models. Due to this reason, these datasets have been mainly studied by traditional machine learning methods. Most recently, Founta et al. founta2018large introduced Hate and Abusive Speech on Twitter, a dataset containing 100K tweets with cross-validated labels. Although this corpus has great potential in training deep models with its significant size, there are no baseline reports to date.\nThis paper investigates the efficacy of different learning models in detecting abusive language. We compare accuracy using the most frequently studied machine learning classifiers as well as recent neural network models. Reliable baseline results are presented with the first comparative study on this dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of different features and variants, and describe the possibility for further improvements with the use of ensemble models.\nRelated Work\nThe research community introduced various approaches on abusive language detection. Razavi et al. razavi2010offensive applied Na\u00efve Bayes, and Warner and Hirschberg warner2012detecting used Support Vector Machine (SVM), both with word-level features to classify offensive language. Xiang et al. xiang2012detecting generated topic distributions with Latent Dirichlet Allocation BIBREF12 , also using word-level features in order to classify offensive tweets.\nMore recently, distributed word representations and neural network models have been widely applied for abusive language detection. Djuric et al. djuric2015hate used the Continuous Bag Of Words model with paragraph2vec algorithm BIBREF13 to more accurately detect hate speech than that of the plain Bag Of Words models. Badjatiya et al. badjatiya2017deep implemented Gradient Boosted Decision Trees classifiers using word representations trained by deep learning models. Other researchers have investigated character-level representations and their effectiveness compared to word-level representations BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 .\nAs traditional machine learning methods have relied on feature engineering, (i.e. n-grams, POS tags, user information) BIBREF1 , researchers have proposed neural-based models with the advent of larger datasets. Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks have been applied to detect abusive language, and they have outperformed traditional machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression and SVM BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 . However, there are no studies investigating the efficiency of neural models with large-scale datasets over 100K.\nMethodology\nThis section illustrates our implementations on traditional machine learning classifiers and neural network based models in detail. Furthermore, we describe additional features and variant models investigated.\nTraditional Machine Learning Models\nWe implement five feature engineering based machine learning classifiers that are most often used for abusive language detection. In data preprocessing, text sequences are converted into Bag Of Words (BOW) representations, and normalized with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) values. We experiment with word-level features using n-grams ranging from 1 to 3, and character-level features from 3 to 8-grams. Each classifier is implemented with the following specifications:\nNa\u00efve Bayes (NB): Multinomial NB with additive smoothing constant 1\nLogistic Regression (LR): Linear LR with L2 regularization constant 1 and limited-memory BFGS optimization\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM): Linear SVM with L2 regularization constant 1 and logistic loss function\nRandom Forests (RF): Averaging probabilistic predictions of 10 randomized decision trees\nGradient Boosted Trees (GBT): Tree boosting with learning rate 1 and logistic loss function\nNeural Network based Models\nAlong with traditional machine learning approaches, we investigate neural network based models to evaluate their efficacy within a larger dataset. In particular, we explore Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and their variant models. A pre-trained GloVe BIBREF17 representation is used for word-level features.\nCNN: We adopt Kim's kim2014convolutional implementation as the baseline. The word-level CNN models have 3 convolutional filters of different sizes [1,2,3] with ReLU activation, and a max-pooling layer. For the character-level CNN, we use 6 convolutional filters of various sizes [3,4,5,6,7,8], then add max-pooling layers followed by 1 fully-connected layer with a dimension of 1024.\nPark and Fung park2017one proposed a HybridCNN model which outperformed both word-level and character-level CNNs in abusive language detection. In order to evaluate the HybridCNN for this dataset, we concatenate the output of max-pooled layers from word-level and character-level CNN, and feed this vector to a fully-connected layer in order to predict the output.\nAll three CNN models (word-level, character-level, and hybrid) use cross entropy with softmax as their loss function and Adam BIBREF18 as the optimizer.\nRNN: We use bidirectional RNN BIBREF19 as the baseline, implementing a GRU BIBREF20 cell for each recurrent unit. From extensive parameter-search experiments, we chose 1 encoding layer with 50 dimensional hidden states and an input dropout probability of 0.3. The RNN models use cross entropy with sigmoid as their loss function and Adam as the optimizer.\nFor a possible improvement, we apply a self-matching attention mechanism on RNN baseline models BIBREF21 so that they may better understand the data by retrieving text sequences twice. We also investigate a recently introduced method, Latent Topic Clustering (LTC) BIBREF22 . The LTC method extracts latent topic information from the hidden states of RNN, and uses it for additional information in classifying the text data.\nFeature Extension\nWhile manually analyzing the raw dataset, we noticed that looking at the tweet one has replied to or has quoted, provides significant contextual information. We call these, \u201ccontext tweets\". As humans can better understand a tweet with the reference of its context, our assumption is that computers also benefit from taking context tweets into account in detecting abusive language.\nAs shown in the examples below, (2) is labeled abusive due to the use of vulgar language. However, the intention of the user can be better understood with its context tweet (1).\n(1) I hate when I'm sitting in front of the bus and somebody with a wheelchair get on.\nINLINEFORM0 (2) I hate it when I'm trying to board a bus and there's already an as**ole on it.\nSimilarly, context tweet (3) is important in understanding the abusive tweet (4), especially in identifying the target of the malice.\n(3) Survivors of #Syria Gas Attack Recount `a Cruel Scene'.\nINLINEFORM0 (4) Who the HELL is \u201cLIKE\" ING this post? Sick people....\nHuang et al. huang2016modeling used several attributes of context tweets for sentiment analysis in order to improve the baseline LSTM model. However, their approach was limited because the meta-information they focused on\u2014author information, conversation type, use of the same hashtags or emojis\u2014are all highly dependent on data.\nIn order to avoid data dependency, text sequences of context tweets are directly used as an additional feature of neural network models. We use the same baseline model to convert context tweets to vectors, then concatenate these vectors with outputs of their corresponding labeled tweets. More specifically, we concatenate max-pooled layers of context and labeled tweets for the CNN baseline model. As for RNN, the last hidden states of context and labeled tweets are concatenated.\nDataset\nHate and Abusive Speech on Twitter BIBREF10 classifies tweets into 4 labels, \u201cnormal\", \u201cspam\", \u201chateful\" and \u201cabusive\". We were only able to crawl 70,904 tweets out of 99,996 tweet IDs, mainly because the tweet was deleted or the user account had been suspended. Table shows the distribution of labels of the crawled data.\nData Preprocessing\nIn the data preprocessing steps, user IDs, URLs, and frequently used emojis are replaced as special tokens. Since hashtags tend to have a high correlation with the content of the tweet BIBREF23 , we use a segmentation library BIBREF24 for hashtags to extract more information.\nFor character-level representations, we apply the method Zhang et al. zhang2015character proposed. Tweets are transformed into one-hot encoded vectors using 70 character dimensions\u201426 lower-cased alphabets, 10 digits, and 34 special characters including whitespace.\nTraining and Evaluation\nIn training the feature engineering based machine learning classifiers, we truncate vector representations according to the TF-IDF values (the top 14,000 and 53,000 for word-level and character-level representations, respectively) to avoid overfitting. For neural network models, words that appear only once are replaced as unknown tokens.\nSince the dataset used is not split into train, development, and test sets, we perform 10-fold cross validation, obtaining the average of 5 tries; we divide the dataset randomly by a ratio of 85:5:10, respectively. In order to evaluate the overall performance, we calculate the weighted average of precision, recall, and F1 scores of all four labels, \u201cnormal\u201d, \u201cspam\u201d, \u201chateful\u201d, and \u201cabusive\u201d.\nEmpirical Results\nAs shown in Table , neural network models are more accurate than feature engineering based models (i.e. NB, SVM, etc.) except for the LR model\u2014the best LR model has the same F1 score as the best CNN model.\nAmong traditional machine learning models, the most accurate in classifying abusive language is the LR model followed by ensemble models such as GBT and RF. Character-level representations improve F1 scores of SVM and RF classifiers, but they have no positive effect on other models.\nFor neural network models, RNN with LTC modules have the highest accuracy score, but there are no significant improvements from its baseline model and its attention-added model. Similarly, HybridCNN does not improve the baseline CNN model. For both CNN and RNN models, character-level features significantly decrease the accuracy of classification.\nThe use of context tweets generally have little effect on baseline models, however they noticeably improve the scores of several metrics. For instance, CNN with context tweets score the highest recall and F1 for \u201chateful\" labels, and RNN models with context tweets have the highest recall for \u201cabusive\" tweets.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nWhile character-level features are known to improve the accuracy of neural network models BIBREF16 , they reduce classification accuracy for Hate and Abusive Speech on Twitter. We conclude this is because of the lack of labeled data as well as the significant imbalance among the different labels. Unlike neural network models, character-level features in traditional machine learning classifiers have positive results because we have trained the models only with the most significant character elements using TF-IDF values.\nVariants of neural network models also suffer from data insufficiency. However, these models show positive performances on \u201cspam\" (14%) and \u201chateful\" (4%) tweets\u2014the lower distributed labels. The highest F1 score for \u201cspam\" is from the RNN-LTC model (0.551), and the highest for \u201chateful\" is CNN with context tweets (0.309). Since each variant model excels in different metrics, we expect to see additional improvements with the use of ensemble models of these variants in future works.\nIn this paper, we report the baseline accuracy of different learning models as well as their variants on the recently introduced dataset, Hate and Abusive Speech on Twitter. Experimental results show that bidirectional GRU networks with LTC provide the most accurate results in detecting abusive language. Additionally, we present the possibility of using ensemble models of variant models and features for further improvements.\nAcknowledgments\nK.

    "Introduction\nThis work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence. Licence details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nIn the spirit of the brevity of social media's messages and reactions, people have got used to express feelings minimally and symbolically, as with hashtags on Twitter and Instagram. On Facebook, people tend to be more wordy, but posts normally receive more simple \u201clikes\u201d than longer comments. Since February 2016, Facebook users can express specific emotions in response to a post thanks to the newly introduced reaction feature (see Section SECREF2 ), so that now a post can be wordlessly marked with an expression of say \u201cjoy\" or \u201csurprise\" rather than a generic \u201clike\u201d.\nIt has been observed that this new feature helps Facebook to know much more about their users and exploit this information for targeted advertising BIBREF0 , but interest in people's opinions and how they feel isn't limited to commercial reasons, as it invests social monitoring, too, including health care and education BIBREF1 . However, emotions and opinions are not always expressed this explicitly, so that there is high interest in developing systems towards their automatic detection. Creating manually annotated datasets large enough to train supervised models is not only costly, but also\u2014especially in the case of opinions and emotions\u2014difficult, due to the intrinsic subjectivity of the task BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 . Therefore, research has focused on unsupervised methods enriched with information derived from lexica, which are manually created BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 . Since go2009twitter have shown that happy and sad emoticons can be successfully used as signals for sentiment labels, distant supervision, i.e. using some reasonably safe signals as proxies for automatically labelling training data BIBREF5 , has been used also for emotion recognition, for example exploiting both emoticons and Twitter hashtags BIBREF6 , but mainly towards creating emotion lexica. mohammad2015using use hashtags, experimenting also with highly fine-grained emotion sets (up to almost 600 emotion labels), to create the large Hashtag Emotion Lexicon. Emoticons are used as proxies also by hallsmarmulti, who use distributed vector representations to find which words are interchangeable with emoticons but also which emoticons are used in a similar context.\nWe take advantage of distant supervision by using Facebook reactions as proxies for emotion labels, which to the best of our knowledge hasn't been done yet, and we train a set of Support Vector Machine models for emotion recognition. Our models, differently from existing ones, exploit information which is acquired entirely automatically, and achieve competitive or even state-of-the-art results for some of the emotion labels on existing, standard evaluation datasets. For explanatory purposes, related work is discussed further and more in detail when we describe the benchmarks for evaluation (Section SECREF3 ) and when we compare our models to existing ones (Section SECREF5 ). We also explore and discuss how choosing different sets of Facebook pages as training data provides an intrinsic domain-adaptation method.\nFacebook reactions as labels\nFor years, on Facebook people could leave comments to posts, and also \u201clike\u201d them, by using a thumbs-up feature to explicitly express a generic, rather underspecified, approval. A \u201clike\u201d could thus mean \u201cI like what you said\", but also \u201cI like that you bring up such topic (though I find the content of the article you linked annoying)\".\nIn February 2016, after a short trial, Facebook made a more explicit reaction feature available world-wide. Rather than allowing for the underspecified \u201clike\u201d as the only wordless response to a post, a set of six more specific reactions was introduced, as shown in Figure FIGREF1 : Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad and Angry. We use such reactions as proxies for emotion labels associated to posts.\nWe collected Facebook posts and their corresponding reactions from public pages using the Facebook API, which we accessed via the Facebook-sdk python library. We chose different pages (and therefore domains and stances), aiming at a balanced and varied dataset, but we did so mainly based on intuition (see Section SECREF4 ) and with an eye to the nature of the datasets available for evaluation (see Section SECREF5 ). The choice of which pages to select posts from is far from trivial, and we believe this is actually an interesting aspect of our approach, as by using different Facebook pages one can intrinsically tackle the domain-adaptation problem (See Section SECREF6 for further discussion on this). The final collection of Facebook pages for the experiments described in this paper is as follows: FoxNews, CNN, ESPN, New York Times, Time magazine, Huffington Post Weird News, The Guardian, Cartoon Network, Cooking Light, Home Cooking Adventure, Justin Bieber, Nickelodeon, Spongebob, Disney.\nNote that thankful was only available during specific time spans related to certain events, as Mother's Day in May 2016.\nFor each page, we downloaded the latest 1000 posts, or the maximum available if there are fewer, from February 2016, retrieving the counts of reactions for each post. The output is a JSON file containing a list of dictionaries with a timestamp, the post and a reaction vector with frequency values, which indicate how many users used that reaction in response to the post (Figure FIGREF3 ). The resulting emotion vectors must then be turned into an emotion label.\nIn the context of this experiment, we made the simple decision of associating to each post the emotion with the highest count, ignoring like as it is the default and most generic reaction people tend to use. Therefore, for example, to the first post in Figure FIGREF3 , we would associate the label sad, as it has the highest score (284) among the meaningful emotions we consider, though it also has non-zero scores for other emotions. At this stage, we didn't perform any other entropy-based selection of posts, to be investigated in future work.\nEmotion datasets\nThree datasets annotated with emotions are commonly used for the development and evaluation of emotion detection systems, namely the Affective Text dataset, the Fairy Tales dataset, and the ISEAR dataset. In order to compare our performance to state-of-the-art results, we have used them as well. In this Section, in addition to a description of each dataset, we provide an overview of the emotions used, their distribution, and how we mapped them to those we obtained from Facebook posts in Section SECREF7 . A summary is provided in Table TABREF8 , which also shows, in the bottom row, what role each dataset has in our experiments: apart from the development portion of the Affective Text, which we used to develop our models (Section SECREF4 ), all three have been used as benchmarks for our evaluation.\nAffective Text dataset\nTask 14 at SemEval 2007 BIBREF7 was concerned with the classification of emotions and valence in news headlines. The headlines where collected from several news websites including Google news, The New York Times, BBC News and CNN. The used emotion labels were Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, in line with the six basic emotions of Ekman's standard model BIBREF8 . Valence was to be determined as positive or negative. Classification of emotion and valence were treated as separate tasks. Emotion labels were not considered as mututally exclusive, and each emotion was assigned a score from 0 to 100. Training/developing data amounted to 250 annotated headlines (Affective development), while systems were evaluated on another 1000 (Affective test). Evaluation was done using two different methods: a fine-grained evaluation using Pearson's r to measure the correlation between the system scores and the gold standard; and a coarse-grained method where each emotion score was converted to a binary label, and precision, recall, and f-score were computed to assess performance. As it is done in most works that use this dataset BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF9 , we also treat this as a classification problem (coarse-grained). This dataset has been extensively used for the evaluation of various unsupervised methods BIBREF2 , but also for testing different supervised learning techniques and feature portability BIBREF10 .\nFairy Tales dataset\nThis is a dataset collected by alm2008affect, where about 1,000 sentences from fairy tales (by B. Potter, H.C. Andersen and Grimm) were annotated with the same six emotions of the Affective Text dataset, though with different names: Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, Happy, Sad, and Surprised. In most works that use this dataset BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF9 , only sentences where all annotators agreed are used, and the labels angry and disgusted are merged. We adopt the same choices.\nISEAR\nThe ISEAR (International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 ) is a dataset created in the context of a psychology project of the 1990s, by collecting questionnaires answered by people with different cultural backgrounds. The main aim of this project was to gather insights in cross-cultural aspects of emotional reactions. Student respondents, both psychologists and non-psychologists, were asked to report situations in which they had experienced all of seven major emotions (joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, shame and guilt). In each case, the questions covered the way they had appraised a given situation and how they reacted. The final dataset contains reports by approximately 3000 respondents from all over the world, for a total of 7665 sentences labelled with an emotion, making this the largest dataset out of the three we use.\nOverview of datasets and emotions\nWe summarise datasets and emotion distribution from two viewpoints. First, because there are different sets of emotions labels in the datasets and Facebook data, we need to provide a mapping and derive a subset of emotions that we are going to use for the experiments. This is shown in Table TABREF8 , where in the \u201cMapped\u201d column we report the final emotions we use in this paper: anger, joy, sadness, surprise. All labels in each dataset are mapped to these final emotions, which are therefore the labels we use for training and testing our models.\nSecond, the distribution of the emotions for each dataset is different, as can be seen in Figure FIGREF9 .\nIn Figure FIGREF9 we also provide the distribution of the emotions anger, joy, sadness, surprise per Facebook page, in terms of number of posts (recall that we assign to a post the label corresponding to the majority emotion associated to it, see Section SECREF2 ). We can observe that for example pages about news tend to have more sadness and anger posts, while pages about cooking and tv-shows have a high percentage of joy posts. We will use this information to find the best set of pages for a given target domain (see Section SECREF5 ).\nModel\nThere are two main decisions to be taken in developing our model: (i) which Facebook pages to select as training data, and (ii) which features to use to train the model, which we discuss below. Specifically, we first set on a subset of pages and then experiment with features. Further exploration of the interaction between choice of pages and choice of features is left to future work, and partly discussed in Section SECREF6 . For development, we use a small portion of the Affective data set described in Section SECREF4 , that is the portion that had been released as development set for SemEval's 2007 Task 14 BIBREF7 , which contains 250 annotated sentences (Affective development, Section SECREF4 ). All results reported in this section are on this dataset. The test set of Task 14 as well as the other two datasets described in Section SECREF3 will be used to evaluate the final models (Section SECREF4 ).\nSelecting Facebook pages\nAlthough page selection is a crucial ingredient of this approach, which we believe calls for further and deeper, dedicated investigation, for the experiments described here we took a rather simple approach. First, we selected the pages that would provide training data based on intuition and availability, then chose different combinations according to results of a basic model run on development data, and eventually tested feature combinations, still on the development set.\nFor the sake of simplicity and transparency, we first trained an SVM with a simple bag-of-words model and default parameters as per the Scikit-learn implementation BIBREF13 on different combinations of pages. Based on results of the attempted combinations as well as on the distribution of emotions in the development dataset (Figure FIGREF9 ), we selected a best model (B-M), namely the combined set of Time, The Guardian and Disney, which yields the highest results on development data. Time and The Guardian perform well on most emotions but Disney helps to boost the performance for the Joy class.\nFeatures\nIn selecting appropriate features, we mainly relied on previous work and intuition. We experimented with different combinations, and all tests were still done on Affective development, using the pages for the best model (B-M) described above as training data. Results are in Table TABREF20 . Future work will further explore the simultaneous selection of features and page combinations.\nWe use a set of basic text-based features to capture the emotion class. These include a tf-idf bag-of-words feature, word (2-3) and character (2-5) ngrams, and features related to the presence of negation words, and to the usage of punctuation.\nThis feature is used in all unsupervised models as a source of information, and we mainly include it to assess its contribution, but eventually do not use it in our final model.\nWe used the NRC10 Lexicon because it performed best in the experiments by BIBREF10 , which is built around the emotions anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise, and the valence values positive and negative. For each word in the lexicon, a boolean value indicating presence or absence is associated to each emotion. For a whole sentence, a global score per emotion can be obtained by summing the vectors for all content words of that sentence included in the lexicon, and used as feature.\nAs additional feature, we also included Word Embeddings, namely distributed representations of words in a vector space, which have been exceptionally successful in boosting performance in a plethora of NLP tasks. We use three different embeddings:\nGoogle embeddings: pre-trained embeddings trained on Google News and obtained with the skip-gram architecture described in BIBREF14 . This model contains 300-dimensional vectors for 3 million words and phrases.\nFacebook embeddings: embeddings that we trained on our scraped Facebook pages for a total of 20,000 sentences. Using the gensim library BIBREF15 , we trained the embeddings with the following parameters: window size of 5, learning rate of 0.01 and dimensionality of 100. We filtered out words with frequency lower than 2 occurrences.\nRetrofitted embeddings: Retrofitting BIBREF16 has been shown as a simple but efficient way of informing trained embeddings with additional information derived from some lexical resource, rather than including it directly at the training stage, as it's done for example to create sense-aware BIBREF17 or sentiment-aware BIBREF18 embeddings. In this work, we retrofit general embeddings to include information about emotions, so that emotion-similar words can get closer in space. Both the Google as well as our Facebook embeddings were retrofitted with lexical information obtained from the NRC10 Lexicon mentioned above, which provides emotion-similarity for each token. Note that differently from the previous two types of embeddings, the retrofitted ones do rely on handcrafted information in the form of a lexical resource.\nResults on development set\nWe report precision, recall, and f-score on the development set. The average f-score is reported as micro-average, to better account for the skewed distribution of the classes as well as in accordance to what is usually reported for this task BIBREF19 .\nFrom Table TABREF20 we draw three main observations. First, a simple tf-idf bag-of-word mode works already very well, to the point that the other textual and lexicon-based features don't seem to contribute to the overall f-score (0.368), although there is a rather substantial variation of scores per class. Second, Google embeddings perform a lot better than Facebook embeddings, and this is likely due to the size of the corpus used for training. Retrofitting doesn't seem to help at all for the Google embeddings, but it does boost the Facebook embeddings, leading to think that with little data, more accurate task-related information is helping, but corpus size matters most. Third, in combination with embeddings, all features work better than just using tf-idf, but removing the Lexicon feature, which is the only one based on hand-crafted resources, yields even better results. Then our best model (B-M) on development data relies entirely on automatically obtained information, both in terms of training data as well as features.\nResults\nIn Table TABREF26 we report the results of our model on the three datasets standardly used for the evaluation of emotion classification, which we have described in Section SECREF3 .\nOur B-M model relies on subsets of Facebook pages for training, which were chosen according to their performance on the development set as well as on the observation of emotions distribution on different pages and in the different datasets, as described in Section SECREF4 . The feature set we use is our best on the development set, namely all the features plus Google-based embeddings, but excluding the lexicon. This makes our approach completely independent of any manual annotation or handcrafted resource. Our model's performance is compared to the following systems, for which results are reported in the referred literature. Please note that no other existing model was re-implemented, and results are those reported in the respective papers.\nDiscussion, conclusions and future work\nWe have explored the potential of using Facebook reactions in a distant supervised setting to perform emotion classification. The evaluation on standard benchmarks shows that models trained as such, especially when enhanced with continuous vector representations, can achieve competitive results without relying on any handcrafted resource. An interesting aspect of our approach is the view to domain adaptation via the selection of Facebook pages to be used as training data.\nWe believe that this approach has a lot of potential, and we see the following directions for improvement. Feature-wise, we want to train emotion-aware embeddings, in the vein of work by tang:14, and iacobacci2015sensembed. Retrofitting FB-embeddings trained on a larger corpus might also be successful, but would rely on an external lexicon.\nThe largest room for yielding not only better results but also interesting insights on extensions of this approach lies in the choice of training instances, both in terms of Facebook pages to get posts from, as well as in which posts to select from the given pages. For the latter, one could for example only select posts that have a certain length, ignore posts that are only quotes or captions to images, or expand posts by including content from linked html pages, which might provide larger and better contexts BIBREF23 . Additionally, and most importantly, one could use an entropy-based measure to select only posts that have a strong emotion rather than just considering the majority emotion as training label. For the former, namely the choice of Facebook pages, which we believe deserves the most investigation, one could explore several avenues, especially in relation to stance-based issues BIBREF24 . In our dataset, for example, a post about Chile beating Colombia in a football match during the Copa America had very contradictory reactions, depending on which side readers would cheer for. Similarly, the very same political event, for example, would get very different reactions from readers if it was posted on Fox News or The Late Night Show, as the target audience is likely to feel very differently about the same issue. This also brings up theoretical issues related more generally to the definition of the emotion detection task, as it's strongly dependent on personal traits of the audience. Also, in this work, pages initially selected on availability and intuition were further grouped into sets to make training data according to performance on development data, and label distribution. Another criterion to be exploited would be vocabulary overlap between the pages and the datasets.\nLastly, we could develop single models for each emotion, treating the problem as a multi-label task. This would even better reflect the ambiguity and subjectivity intrinsic to assigning emotions to text, where content could be at same time joyful or sad, depending on the reader.\nAcknowledgements\nIn addition to the anonymous reviewers, we want to thank Lucia Passaro and Barbara Plank for insightful discussions, and for providing comments on draft versions of this paper.",
    "Introduction\nA hashtag is a keyphrase represented as a sequence of alphanumeric characters plus underscore, preceded by the # symbol. Hashtags play a central role in online communication by providing a tool to categorize the millions of posts generated daily on Twitter, Instagram, etc. They are useful in search, tracking content about a certain topic BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , or discovering emerging trends BIBREF2 .\nHashtags often carry very important information, such as emotion BIBREF3 , sentiment BIBREF4 , sarcasm BIBREF5 , and named entities BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 . However, inferring the semantics of hashtags is non-trivial since many hashtags contain multiple tokens joined together, which frequently leads to multiple potential interpretations (e.g., lion head vs. lionhead). Table TABREF3 shows several examples of single- and multi-token hashtags. While most hashtags represent a mix of standard tokens, named entities and event names are prevalent and pose challenges to both human and automatic comprehension, as these are more likely to be rare tokens. Hashtags also tend to be shorter to allow fast typing, to attract attention or to satisfy length limitations imposed by some social media platforms. Thus, they tend to contain a large number of abbreviations or non-standard spelling variations (e.g., #iloveu4eva) BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , which hinders their understanding.\nThe goal of our study is to build efficient methods for automatically splitting a hashtag into a meaningful word sequence. Our contributions are:\nOur new dataset includes segmentation for 12,594 unique hashtags and their associated tweets annotated in a multi-step process for higher quality than the previous dataset of 1,108 hashtags BIBREF10 . We frame the segmentation task as a pairwise ranking problem, given a set of candidate segmentations. We build several neural architectures using this problem formulation which use corpus-based, linguistic and thesaurus based features. We further propose a multi-task learning approach which jointly learns segment ranking and single- vs. multi-token hashtag classification. The latter leads to an error reduction of 24.6% over the current state-of-the-art. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method by using hashtag segmentation in the downstream task of sentiment analysis. Feeding the automatically segmented hashtags to a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis method on the SemEval 2017 benchmark dataset results in a 2.6% increase in the official metric for the task.\nBackground and Preliminaries\nCurrent approaches for hashtag segmentation can be broadly divided into three categories: (a) gazeteer and rule based BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , (b) word boundary detection BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 , and (c) ranking with language model and other features BIBREF16 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF0 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . Hashtag segmentation approaches draw upon work on compound splitting for languages such as German or Finnish BIBREF19 and word segmentation BIBREF20 for languages with no spaces between words such as Chinese BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 . Similar to our work, BIBREF10 BansalBV15 extract an initial set of candidate segmentations using a sliding window, then rerank them using a linear regression model trained on lexical, bigram and other corpus-based features. The current state-of-the-art approach BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 uses maximum entropy and CRF models with a combination of language model and hand-crafted features to predict if each character in the hashtag is the beginning of a new word.\nGenerating Candidate Segmentations. Microsoft Word Breaker BIBREF16 is, among the existing methods, a strong baseline for hashtag segmentation, as reported in BIBREF14 and BIBREF10 . It employs a beam search algorithm to extract INLINEFORM0 best segmentations as ranked by the n-gram language model probability: INLINEFORM1\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the word sequence of segmentation INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 is the window size. More sophisticated ranking strategies, such as Binomial and word length distribution based ranking, did not lead to a further improvement in performance BIBREF16 . The original Word Breaker was designed for segmenting URLs using language models trained on web data. In this paper, we reimplemented and tailored this approach to segmenting hashtags by using a language model specifically trained on Twitter data (implementation details in \u00a7 SECREF26 ). The performance of this method itself is competitive with state-of-the-art methods (evaluation results in \u00a7 SECREF46 ). Our proposed pairwise ranking method will effectively take the top INLINEFORM3 segmentations generated by this baseline as candidates for reranking.\nHowever, in prior work, the ranking scores of each segmentation were calculated independently, ignoring the relative order among the top INLINEFORM0 candidate segmentations. To address this limitation, we utilize a pairwise ranking strategy for the first time for this task and propose neural architectures to model this.\nMulti-task Pairwise Neural Ranking\nWe propose a multi-task pairwise neural ranking approach to better incorporate and distinguish the relative order between the candidate segmentations of a given hashtag. Our model adapts to address single- and multi-token hashtags differently via a multi-task learning strategy without requiring additional annotations. In this section, we describe the task setup and three variants of pairwise neural ranking models (Figure FIGREF11 ).\nSegmentation as Pairwise Ranking\nThe goal of hashtag segmentation is to divide a given hashtag INLINEFORM0 into a sequence of meaningful words INLINEFORM1 . For a hashtag of INLINEFORM2 characters, there are a total of INLINEFORM3 possible segmentations but only one, or occasionally two, of them ( INLINEFORM4 ) are considered correct (Table TABREF9 ).\nWe transform this task into a pairwise ranking problem: given INLINEFORM0 candidate segmentations { INLINEFORM1 }, we rank them by comparing each with the rest in a pairwise manner. More specifically, we train a model to predict a real number INLINEFORM2 for any two candidate segmentations INLINEFORM3 and INLINEFORM4 of hashtag INLINEFORM5 , which indicates INLINEFORM6 is a better segmentation than INLINEFORM7 if positive, and vice versa. To quantify the quality of a segmentation in training, we define a gold scoring function INLINEFORM8 based on the similarities with the ground-truth segmentation INLINEFORM9 : INLINEFORM10\nWe use the Levenshtein distance (minimum number of single-character edits) in this paper, although it is possible to use other similarity measurements as alternatives. We use the top INLINEFORM0 segmentations generated by Microsoft Word Breaker (\u00a7 SECREF2 ) as initial candidates.\nPairwise Neural Ranking Model\nFor an input candidate segmentation pair INLINEFORM0 , we concatenate their feature vectors INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 , and feed them into a feedforward network which emits a comparison score INLINEFORM3 . The feature vector INLINEFORM4 or INLINEFORM5 consists of language model probabilities using Good-Turing BIBREF23 and modified Kneser-Ney smoothing BIBREF24 , BIBREF25 , lexical and linguistic features (more details in \u00a7 SECREF23 ). For training, we use all the possible pairs INLINEFORM6 of the INLINEFORM7 candidates as the input and their gold scores INLINEFORM8 as the target. The training objective is to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE): DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the number of training examples.\nTo aggregate the pairwise comparisons, we follow a greedy algorithm proposed by BIBREF26 cohen1998learning and used for preference ranking BIBREF27 . For each segmentation INLINEFORM0 in the candidate set INLINEFORM1 , we calculate a single score INLINEFORM2 , and find the segmentation INLINEFORM3 corresponding to the highest score. We repeat the same procedure after removing INLINEFORM4 from INLINEFORM5 , and continue until INLINEFORM6 reduces to an empty set. Figure FIGREF11 (a) shows the architecture of this model.\nMargin Ranking (MR) Loss\nAs an alternative to the pairwise ranker (\u00a7 SECREF15 ), we propose a pairwise model which learns from candidate pairs INLINEFORM0 but ranks each individual candidate directly rather than relatively. We define a new scoring function INLINEFORM1 which assigns a higher score to the better candidate, i.e., INLINEFORM2 , if INLINEFORM3 is a better candidate than INLINEFORM4 and vice-versa. Instead of concatenating the features vectors INLINEFORM5 and INLINEFORM6 , we feed them separately into two identical feedforward networks with shared parameters. During testing, we use only one of the networks to rank the candidates based on the INLINEFORM7 scores. For training, we add a ranking layer on top of the networks to measure the violations in the ranking order and minimize the Margin Ranking Loss (MR): DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the number of training samples. The architecture of this model is presented in Figure FIGREF11 (b).\nAdaptive Multi-task Learning\nBoth models in \u00a7 SECREF15 and \u00a7 SECREF17 treat all the hashtags uniformly. However, different features address different types of hashtags. By design, the linguistic features capture named entities and multi-word hashtags that exhibit word shape patterns, such as camel case. The ngram probabilities with Good-Turing smoothing gravitate towards multi-word segmentations with known words, as its estimate for unseen ngrams depends on the fraction of ngrams seen once which can be very low BIBREF28 . The modified Kneser-Ney smoothing is more likely to favor segmentations that contain rare words, and single-word segmentations in particular. Please refer to \u00a7 SECREF46 for a more detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis.\nTo leverage this intuition, we introduce a binary classification task to help the model differentiate single-word from multi-word hashtags. The binary classifier takes hashtag features INLINEFORM0 as the input and outputs INLINEFORM1 , which represents the probability of INLINEFORM2 being a multi-word hashtag. INLINEFORM3 is used as an adaptive gating value in our multi-task learning setup. The gold labels for this task are obtained at no extra cost by simply verifying whether the ground-truth segmentation has multiple words. We train the pairwise segmentation ranker and the binary single- vs. multi-token hashtag classifier jointly, by minimizing INLINEFORM4 for the pairwise ranker and the Binary Cross Entropy Error ( INLINEFORM5 ) for the classifier: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the adaptive gating value, INLINEFORM1 indicates if INLINEFORM2 is actually a multi-word hashtag and INLINEFORM3 is the number of training examples. INLINEFORM4 and INLINEFORM5 are the weights for each loss. For our experiments, we apply equal weights.\nMore specifically, we divide the segmentation feature vector INLINEFORM0 into two subsets: (a) INLINEFORM1 with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing features, and (b) INLINEFORM2 with Good-Turing smoothing and linguistic features. For an input candidate segmentation pair INLINEFORM3 , we construct two pairwise vectors INLINEFORM4 and INLINEFORM5 by concatenation, then combine them based on the adaptive gating value INLINEFORM6 before feeding them into the feedforward network INLINEFORM7 for pairwise ranking: DISPLAYFORM0\nWe use summation with padding, as we find this simple ensemble method achieves similar performance in our experiments as the more complex multi-column networks BIBREF29 . Figure FIGREF11 (c) shows the architecture of this model. An analogue multi-task formulation can also be used for the Margin Ranking loss as: DISPLAYFORM0\nFeatures\nWe use a combination of corpus-based and linguistic features to rank the segmentations. For a candidate segmentation INLINEFORM0 , its feature vector INLINEFORM1 includes the number of words in the candidate, the length of each word, the proportion of words in an English dictionary or Urban Dictionary BIBREF30 , ngram counts from Google Web 1TB corpus BIBREF31 , and ngram probabilities from trigram language models trained on the Gigaword corpus BIBREF32 and 1.1 billion English tweets from 2010, respectively. We train two language models on each corpus: one with Good-Turing smoothing using SRILM BIBREF33 and the other with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing using KenLM BIBREF34 . We also add boolean features, such as if the candidate is a named-entity present in the list of Wikipedia titles, and if the candidate segmentation INLINEFORM2 and its corresponding hashtag INLINEFORM3 satisfy certain word-shapes (more details in appendix SECREF61 ).\nSimilarly, for hashtag INLINEFORM0 , we extract the feature vector INLINEFORM1 consisting of hashtag length, ngram count of the hashtag in Google 1TB corpus BIBREF31 , and boolean features indicating if the hashtag is in an English dictionary or Urban Dictionary, is a named-entity, is in camel case, ends with a number, and has all the letters as consonants. We also include features of the best-ranked candidate by the Word Breaker model.\nImplementation Details\nWe use the PyTorch framework to implement our multi-task pairwise ranking model. The pairwise ranker consists of an input layer, three hidden layers with eight nodes in each layer and hyperbolic tangent ( INLINEFORM0 ) activation, and a single linear output node. The auxiliary classifier consists of an input layer, one hidden layer with eight nodes and one output node with sigmoid activation. We use the Adam algorithm BIBREF35 for optimization and apply a dropout of 0.5 to prevent overfitting. We set the learning rate to 0.01 and 0.05 for the pairwise ranker and auxiliary classifier respectively. For each experiment, we report results obtained after 100 epochs.\nFor the baseline model used to extract the INLINEFORM0 initial candidates, we reimplementated the Word Breaker BIBREF16 as described in \u00a7 SECREF2 and adapted it to use a language model trained on 1.1 billion tweets with Good-Turing smoothing using SRILM BIBREF33 to give a better performance in segmenting hashtags (\u00a7 SECREF46 ). For all our experiments, we set INLINEFORM1 .\nHashtag Segmentation Data\nWe use two datasets for experiments (Table TABREF29 ): (a) STAN INLINEFORM0 , created by BIBREF10 BansalBV15, which consists of 1,108 unique English hashtags from 1,268 randomly selected tweets in the Stanford Sentiment Analysis Dataset BIBREF36 along with their crowdsourced segmentations and our additional corrections; and (b) STAN INLINEFORM1 , our new expert curated dataset, which includes all 12,594 unique English hashtags and their associated tweets from the same Stanford dataset.\nExperiments\nIn this section, we present experimental results that compare our proposed method with the other state-of-the-art approaches on hashtag segmentation datasets. The next section will show experiments of applying hashtag segmentation to the popular task of sentiment analysis.\nExisting Methods\nWe compare our pairwise neural ranker with the following baseline and state-of-the-art approaches:\nThe original hashtag as a single token;\nA rule-based segmenter, which employs a set of word-shape rules with an English dictionary BIBREF13 ;\nA Viterbi model which uses word frequencies from a book corpus BIBREF0 ;\nThe specially developed GATE Hashtag Tokenizer from the open source toolkit, which combines dictionaries and gazetteers in a Viterbi-like algorithm BIBREF11 ;\nA maximum entropy classifier (MaxEnt) trained on the STAN INLINEFORM0 training dataset. It predicts whether a space should be inserted at each position in the hashtag and is the current state-of-the-art BIBREF14 ;\nOur reimplementation of the Word Breaker algorithm which uses beam search and a Twitter ngram language model BIBREF16 ;\nA pairwise linear ranker which we implemented for comparison purposes with the same features as our neural model, but using perceptron as the underlying classifier BIBREF38 and minimizing the hinge loss between INLINEFORM0 and a scoring function similar to INLINEFORM1 . It is trained on the STAN INLINEFORM2 dataset.\nEvaluation Metrics\nWe evaluate the performance by the top INLINEFORM0 ( INLINEFORM1 ) accuracy (A@1, A@2), average token-level F INLINEFORM2 score (F INLINEFORM3 @1), and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). In particular, the accuracy and MRR are calculated at the segmentation-level, which means that an output segmentation is considered correct if and only if it fully matches the human segmentation. Average token-level F INLINEFORM4 score accounts for partially correct segmentation in the multi-token hashtag cases.\nResults\nTables TABREF32 and TABREF33 show the results on the STAN INLINEFORM0 and STAN INLINEFORM1 datasets, respectively. All of our pairwise neural rankers are trained on the 2,518 manually segmented hashtags in the training set of STAN INLINEFORM2 and perform favorably against other state-of-the-art approaches. Our best model (MSE+multitask) that utilizes different features adaptively via a multi-task learning procedure is shown to perform better than simply combining all the features together (MR and MSE). We highlight the 24.6% error reduction on STAN INLINEFORM3 and 16.5% on STAN INLINEFORM4 of our approach over the previous SOTA BIBREF14 on the Multi-token hashtags, and the importance of having a separate evaluation of multi-word cases as it is trivial to obtain 100% accuracy for Single-token hashtags. While our hashtag segmentation model is achieving a very high accuracy@2, to be practically useful, it remains a challenge to get the top one predication exactly correct. Some hashtags are very difficult to interpret, e.g., #BTVbrownSMB refers to the Social Media Breakfast (SMB) in Burlington, Vermont (BTV).\nThe improved Word Breaker with our addition of a Twitter-specific language model is a very strong baseline, which echos the findings of the original Word Breaker paper BIBREF16 that having a large in-domain language model is extremely helpful for word segmentation tasks. It is worth noting that the other state-of-the-art system BIBREF14 also utilized a 4-gram language model trained on 476 million tweets from 2009.\nAnalysis and Discussion\nTo empirically illustrate the effectiveness of different features on different types of hashtags, we show the results for models using individual feature sets in pairwise ranking models (MSE) in Table TABREF45 . Language models with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing perform best on single-token hashtags, while Good-Turing and Linguistic features work best on multi-token hashtags, confirming our intuition about their usefulness in a multi-task learning approach. Table TABREF47 shows a qualitative analysis with the first column ( INLINEFORM0 INLINEFORM1 INLINEFORM2 ) indicating which features lead to correct or wrong segmentations, their count in our data and illustrative examples with human segmentation.\nAs expected, longer hashtags with more than three tokens pose greater challenges and the segmentation-level accuracy of our best model (MSE+multitask) drops to 82.1%. For many error cases, our model predicts a close-to-correct segmentation, e.g., #youbrownknowyoubrownupttoobrownearly, #iseebrownlondoniseebrownfrance, which is also reflected by the higher token-level F INLINEFORM0 scores across hashtags with different lengths (Figure FIGREF51 ).\nSince our approach heavily relies on building a Twitter language model, we experimented with its sizes and show the results in Figure FIGREF52 . Our approach can perform well even with access to a smaller amount of tweets. The drop in F INLINEFORM0 score for our pairwise neural ranker is only 1.4% and 3.9% when using the language models trained on 10% and 1% of the total 1.1 billion tweets, respectively.\nLanguage use in Twitter changes with time BIBREF9 . Our pairwise ranker uses language models trained on the tweets from the year 2010. We tested our approach on a set of 500 random English hashtags posted in tweets from the year 2019 and show the results in Table TABREF55 . With a segmentation-level accuracy of 94.6% and average token-level F INLINEFORM0 score of 95.6%, our approach performs favorably on 2019 hashtags.\nExtrinsic Evaluation: Twitter Sentiment Analysis\nWe attempt to demonstrate the effectiveness of our hashtag segmentation system by studying its impact on the task of sentiment analysis in Twitter BIBREF39 , BIBREF40 , BIBREF41 . We use our best model (MSE+multitask), under the name HashtagMaster, in the following experiments.\nExperimental Setup\nWe compare the performance of the BiLSTM+Lex BIBREF42 sentiment analysis model under three configurations: (a) tweets with hashtags removed, (b) tweets with hashtags as single tokens excluding the # symbol, and (c) tweets with hashtags as segmented by our system, HashtagMaster. BiLSTM+Lex is a state-of-the-art open source system for predicting tweet-level sentiment BIBREF43 . It learns a context-sensitive sentiment intensity score by leveraging a Twitter-based sentiment lexicon BIBREF44 . We use the same settings as described by BIBREF42 teng-vo-zhang:2016:EMNLP2016 to train the model.\nWe use the dataset from the Sentiment Analysis in Twitter shared task (subtask A) at SemEval 2017 BIBREF41 . Given a tweet, the goal is to predict whether it expresses POSITIVE, NEGATIVE or NEUTRAL sentiment. The training and development sets consist of 49,669 tweets and we use 40,000 for training and the rest for development. There are a total of 12,284 tweets containing 12,128 hashtags in the SemEval 2017 test set, and our hashtag segmenter ended up splitting 6,975 of those hashtags present in 3,384 tweets.\nResults and Analysis\nIn Table TABREF59 , we report the results based on the 3,384 tweets where HashtagMaster predicted a split, as for the rest of tweets in the test set, the hashtag segmenter would neither improve nor worsen the sentiment prediction. Our hashtag segmenter successfully improved the sentiment analysis performance by 2% on average recall and F INLINEFORM0 comparing to having hashtags unsegmented. This improvement is seemingly small but decidedly important for tweets where sentiment-related information is embedded in multi-word hashtags and sentiment prediction would be incorrect based only on the text (see Table TABREF60 for examples). In fact, 2,605 out of the 3,384 tweets have multi-word hashtags that contain words in the Twitter-based sentiment lexicon BIBREF44 and 125 tweets contain sentiment words only in the hashtags but not in the rest of the tweet. On the entire test set of 12,284 tweets, the increase in the average recall is 0.5%.\nOther Related Work\nAutomatic hashtag segmentation can improve the performance of many applications besides sentiment analysis, such as text classification BIBREF13 , named entity linking BIBREF10 and modeling user interests for recommendations BIBREF45 . It can also help in collecting data of higher volume and quality by providing a more nuanced interpretation of its content, as shown for emotion analysis BIBREF46 , sarcasm and irony detection BIBREF11 , BIBREF47 . Better semantic analysis of hashtags can also potentially be applied to hashtag annotation BIBREF48 , to improve distant supervision labels in training classifiers for tasks such as sarcasm BIBREF5 , sentiment BIBREF4 , emotions BIBREF3 ; and, more generally, as labels for pre-training representations of words BIBREF49 , sentences BIBREF50 , and images BIBREF51 .\nConclusion\nWe proposed a new pairwise neural ranking model for hashtag segmention and showed significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art. We also constructed a larger and more curated dataset for analyzing and benchmarking hashtag segmentation methods. We demonstrated that hashtag segmentation helps with downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis. Although we focused on English hashtags, our pairwise ranking approach is language-independent and we intend to extend our toolkit to languages other than English as future work.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Ohio Supercomputer Center BIBREF52 for computing resources and the NVIDIA for providing GPU hardware.

    "Introduction\nMulti-document summarization (MDS), the transformation of a set of documents into a short text containing their most important aspects, is a long-studied problem in NLP. Generated summaries have been shown to support humans dealing with large document collections in information seeking tasks BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 . However, when exploring a set of documents manually, humans rarely write a fully-formulated summary for themselves. Instead, user studies BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 show that they note down important keywords and phrases, try to identify relationships between them and organize them accordingly. Therefore, we believe that the study of summarization with similarly structured outputs is an important extension of the traditional task.\nA representation that is more in line with observed user behavior is a concept map BIBREF5 , a labeled graph showing concepts as nodes and relationships between them as edges (Figure FIGREF2 ). Introduced in 1972 as a teaching tool BIBREF6 , concept maps have found many applications in education BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , for writing assistance BIBREF9 or to structure information repositories BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 . For summarization, concept maps make it possible to represent a summary concisely and clearly reveal relationships. Moreover, we see a second interesting use case that goes beyond the capabilities of textual summaries: When concepts and relations are linked to corresponding locations in the documents they have been extracted from, the graph can be used to navigate in a document collection, similar to a table of contents. An implementation of this idea has been recently described by BIBREF12 .\nThe corresponding task that we propose is concept-map-based MDS, the summarization of a document cluster in the form of a concept map. In order to develop and evaluate methods for the task, gold-standard corpora are necessary, but no suitable corpus is available. The manual creation of such a dataset is very time-consuming, as the annotation includes many subtasks. In particular, an annotator would need to manually identify all concepts in the documents, while only a few of them will eventually end up in the summary.\nTo overcome these issues, we present a corpus creation method that effectively combines automatic preprocessing, scalable crowdsourcing and high-quality expert annotations. Using it, we can avoid the high effort for single annotators, allowing us to scale to document clusters that are 15 times larger than in traditional summarization corpora. We created a new corpus of 30 topics, each with around 40 source documents on educational topics and a summarizing concept map that is the consensus of many crowdworkers (see Figure FIGREF3 ).\nAs a crucial step of the corpus creation, we developed a new crowdsourcing scheme called low-context importance annotation. In contrast to traditional approaches, it allows us to determine important elements in a document cluster without requiring annotators to read all documents, making it feasible to crowdsource the task and overcome quality issues observed in previous work BIBREF13 . We show that the approach creates reliable data for our focused summarization scenario and, when tested on traditional summarization corpora, creates annotations that are similar to those obtained by earlier efforts.\nTo summarize, we make the following contributions: (1) We propose a novel task, concept-map-based MDS (\u00a7 SECREF2 ), (2) present a new crowdsourcing scheme to create reference summaries (\u00a7 SECREF4 ), (3) publish a new dataset for the proposed task (\u00a7 SECREF5 ) and (4) provide an evaluation protocol and baseline (\u00a7 SECREF7 ). We make these resources publicly available under a permissive license.\nTask\nConcept-map-based MDS is defined as follows: Given a set of related documents, create a concept map that represents its most important content, satisfies a specified size limit and is connected.\nWe define a concept map as a labeled graph showing concepts as nodes and relationships between them as edges. Labels are arbitrary sequences of tokens taken from the documents, making the summarization task extractive. A concept can be an entity, abstract idea, event or activity, designated by its unique label. Good maps should be propositionally coherent, meaning that every relation together with the two connected concepts form a meaningful proposition.\nThe task is complex, consisting of several interdependent subtasks. One has to extract appropriate labels for concepts and relations and recognize different expressions that refer to the same concept across multiple documents. Further, one has to select the most important concepts and relations for the summary and finally organize them in a graph satisfying the connectedness and size constraints.\nRelated Work\nSome attempts have been made to automatically construct concept maps from text, working with either single documents BIBREF14 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 or document clusters BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 . These approaches extract concept and relation labels from syntactic structures and connect them to build a concept map. However, common task definitions and comparable evaluations are missing. In addition, only a few of them, namely Villalon.2012 and Valerio.2006, define summarization as their goal and try to compress the input to a substantially smaller size. Our newly proposed task and the created large-cluster dataset fill these gaps as they emphasize the summarization aspect of the task.\nFor the subtask of selecting summary-worthy concepts and relations, techniques developed for traditional summarization BIBREF20 and keyphrase extraction BIBREF21 are related and applicable. Approaches that build graphs of propositions to create a summary BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 , BIBREF24 , BIBREF25 seem to be particularly related, however, there is one important difference: While they use graphs as an intermediate representation from which a textual summary is then generated, the goal of the proposed task is to create a graph that is directly interpretable and useful for a user. In contrast, these intermediate graphs, e.g. AMR, are hardly useful for a typical, non-linguist user.\nFor traditional summarization, the most well-known datasets emerged out of the DUC and TAC competitions. They provide clusters of news articles with gold-standard summaries. Extending these efforts, several more specialized corpora have been created: With regard to size, Nakano.2010 present a corpus of summaries for large-scale collections of web pages. Recently, corpora with more heterogeneous documents have been suggested, e.g. BIBREF26 and BIBREF27 . The corpus we present combines these aspects, as it has large clusters of heterogeneous documents, and provides a necessary benchmark to evaluate the proposed task.\nFor concept map generation, one corpus with human-created summary concept maps for student essays has been created BIBREF28 . In contrast to our corpus, it only deals with single documents, requires a two orders of magnitude smaller amount of compression of the input and is not publicly available .\nOther types of information representation that also model concepts and their relationships are knowledge bases, such as Freebase BIBREF29 , and ontologies. However, they both differ in important aspects: Whereas concept maps follow an open label paradigm and are meant to be interpretable by humans, knowledge bases and ontologies are usually more strictly typed and made to be machine-readable. Moreover, approaches to automatically construct them from text typically try to extract as much information as possible, while we want to summarize a document.\nLow-Context Importance Annotation\nLloret.2013 describe several experiments to crowdsource reference summaries. Workers are asked to read 10 documents and then select 10 summary sentences from them for a reward of $0.05. They discovered several challenges, including poor work quality and the subjectiveness of the annotation task, indicating that crowdsourcing is not useful for this purpose.\nTo overcome these issues, we introduce a new task design, low-context importance annotation, to determine summary-worthy parts of documents. Compared to Lloret et al.'s approach, it is more in line with crowdsourcing best practices, as the tasks are simple, intuitive and small BIBREF30 and workers receive reasonable payment BIBREF31 . Most importantly, it is also much more efficient and scalable, as it does not require workers to read all documents in a cluster.\nTask Design\nWe break down the task of importance annotation to the level of single propositions. The goal of our crowdsourcing scheme is to obtain a score for each proposition indicating its importance in a document cluster, such that a ranking according to the score would reveal what is most important and should be included in a summary. In contrast to other work, we do not show the documents to the workers at all, but provide only a description of the document cluster's topic along with the propositions. This ensures that tasks are small, simple and can be done quickly (see Figure FIGREF4 ).\nIn preliminary tests, we found that this design, despite the minimal context, works reasonably on our focused clusters on common educational topics. For instance, consider Figure FIGREF4 : One can easily say that P1 is more important than P2 without reading the documents.\nWe distinguish two task variants:\nInstead of enforcing binary importance decisions, we use a 5-point Likert-scale to allow more fine-grained annotations. The obtained labels are translated into scores (5..1) and the average of all scores for a proposition is used as an estimate for its importance. This follows the idea that while single workers might find the task subjective, the consensus of multiple workers, represented in the average score, tends to be less subjective due to the \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d. We randomly group five propositions into a task.\nAs an alternative, we use a second task design based on pairwise comparisons. Comparisons are known to be easier to make and more consistent BIBREF32 , but also more expensive, as the number of pairs grows quadratically with the number of objects. To reduce the cost, we group five propositions into a task and ask workers to order them by importance per drag-and-drop. From the results, we derive pairwise comparisons and use TrueSkill BIBREF35 , a powerful Bayesian rank induction model BIBREF34 , to obtain importance estimates for each proposition.\nPilot Study\nTo verify the proposed approach, we conducted a pilot study on Amazon Mechanical Turk using data from TAC2008 BIBREF36 . We collected importance estimates for 474 propositions extracted from the first three clusters using both task designs. Each Likert-scale task was assigned to 5 different workers and awarded $0.06. For comparison tasks, we also collected 5 labels each, paid $0.05 and sampled around 7% of all possible pairs. We submitted them in batches of 100 pairs and selected pairs for subsequent batches based on the confidence of the TrueSkill model.\nFollowing the observations of Lloret.2013, we established several measures for quality control. First, we restricted our tasks to workers from the US with an approval rate of at least 95%. Second, we identified low quality workers by measuring the correlation of each worker's Likert-scores with the average of the other four scores. The worst workers (at most 5% of all labels) were removed.\nIn addition, we included trap sentences, similar as in BIBREF13 , in around 80 of the tasks. In contrast to Lloret et al.'s findings, both an obvious trap sentence (This sentence is not important) and a less obvious but unimportant one (Barack Obama graduated from Harvard Law) were consistently labeled as unimportant (1.08 and 1.14), indicating that the workers did the task properly.\nFor Likert-scale tasks, we follow Snow.2008 and calculate agreement as the average Pearson correlation of a worker's Likert-score with the average score of the remaining workers. This measure is less strict than exact label agreement and can account for close labels and high- or low-scoring workers. We observe a correlation of 0.81, indicating substantial agreement. For comparisons, the majority agreement is 0.73. To further examine the reliability of the collected data, we followed the approach of Kiritchenko.2016 and simply repeated the crowdsourcing for one of the three topics. Between the importance estimates calculated from the first and second run, we found a Pearson correlation of 0.82 (Spearman 0.78) for Likert-scale tasks and 0.69 (Spearman 0.66) for comparison tasks. This shows that the approach, despite the subjectiveness of the task, allows us to collect reliable annotations.\nIn addition to the reliability studies, we extrinsically evaluated the annotations in the task of summary evaluation. For each of the 58 peer summaries in TAC2008, we calculated a score as the sum of the importance estimates of the propositions it contains. Table TABREF13 shows how these peer scores, averaged over the three topics, correlate with the manual responsiveness scores assigned during TAC in comparison to ROUGE-2 and Pyramid scores. The results demonstrate that with both task designs, we obtain importance annotations that are similarly useful for summary evaluation as pyramid annotations or gold-standard summaries (used for ROUGE).\nBased on the pilot study, we conclude that the proposed crowdsourcing scheme allows us to obtain proper importance annotations for propositions. As workers are not required to read all documents, the annotation is much more efficient and scalable as with traditional methods.\nCorpus Creation\nThis section presents the corpus construction process, as outlined in Figure FIGREF16 , combining automatic preprocessing, scalable crowdsourcing and high-quality expert annotations to be able to scale to the size of our document clusters. For every topic, we spent about $150 on crowdsourcing and 1.5h of expert annotations, while just a single annotator would already need over 8 hours (at 200 words per minute) to read all documents of a topic.\nSource Data\nAs a starting point, we used the DIP corpus BIBREF37 , a collection of 49 clusters of 100 web pages on educational topics (e.g. bullying, homeschooling, drugs) with a short description of each topic. It was created from a large web crawl using state-of-the-art information retrieval. We selected 30 of the topics for which we created the necessary concept map annotations.\nProposition Extraction\nAs concept maps consist of propositions expressing the relation between concepts (see Figure FIGREF2 ), we need to impose such a structure upon the plain text in the document clusters. This could be done by manually annotating spans representing concepts and relations, however, the size of our clusters makes this a huge effort: 2288 sentences per topic (69k in total) need to be processed. Therefore, we resort to an automatic approach.\nThe Open Information Extraction paradigm BIBREF38 offers a representation very similar to the desired one. For instance, from\nStudents with bad credit history should not lose hope and apply for federal loans with the FAFSA.\nOpen IE systems extract tuples of two arguments and a relation phrase representing propositions:\n(s. with bad credit history, should not lose, hope)\n(s. with bad credit history, apply for, federal loans with the FAFSA)\nWhile the relation phrase is similar to a relation in a concept map, many arguments in these tuples represent useful concepts. We used Open IE 4, a state-of-the-art system BIBREF39 to process all sentences. After removing duplicates, we obtained 4137 tuples per topic.\nSince we want to create a gold-standard corpus, we have to ensure that we produce high-quality data. We therefore made use of the confidence assigned to every extracted tuple to filter out low quality ones. To ensure that we do not filter too aggressively (and miss important aspects in the final summary), we manually annotated 500 tuples sampled from all topics for correctness. On the first 250 of them, we tuned the filter threshold to 0.5, which keeps 98.7% of the correct extractions in the unseen second half. After filtering, a topic had on average 2850 propositions (85k in total).\nProposition Filtering\nDespite the similarity of the Open IE paradigm, not every extracted tuple is a suitable proposition for a concept map. To reduce the effort in the subsequent steps, we therefore want to filter out unsuitable ones. A tuple is suitable if it (1) is a correct extraction, (2) is meaningful without any context and (3) has arguments that represent proper concepts. We created a guideline explaining when to label a tuple as suitable for a concept map and performed a small annotation study. Three annotators independently labeled 500 randomly sampled tuples. The agreement was 82% ( INLINEFORM0 ). We found tuples to be unsuitable mostly because they had unresolvable pronouns, conflicting with (2), or arguments that were full clauses or propositions, conflicting with (3), while (1) was mostly taken care of by the confidence filtering in \u00a7 SECREF21 .\nDue to the high number of tuples we decided to automate the filtering step. We trained a linear SVM on the majority voted annotations. As features, we used the extraction confidence, length of arguments and relations as well as part-of-speech tags, among others. To ensure that the automatic classification does not remove suitable propositions, we tuned the classifier to avoid false negatives. In particular, we introduced class weights, improving precision on the negative class at the cost of a higher fraction of positive classifications. Additionally, we manually verified a certain number of the most uncertain negative classifications to further improve performance. When 20% of the classifications are manually verified and corrected, we found that our model trained on 350 labeled instances achieves 93% precision on negative classifications on the unseen 150 instances. We found this to be a reasonable trade-off of automation and data quality and applied the model to the full dataset.\nThe classifier filtered out 43% of the propositions, leaving 1622 per topic. We manually examined the 17k least confident negative classifications and corrected 955 of them. We also corrected positive classifications for certain types of tuples for which we knew the classifier to be imprecise. Finally, each topic was left with an average of 1554 propositions (47k in total).\nImportance Annotation\nGiven the propositions identified in the previous step, we now applied our crowdsourcing scheme as described in \u00a7 SECREF4 to determine their importance. To cope with the large number of propositions, we combine the two task designs: First, we collect Likert-scores from 5 workers for each proposition, clean the data and calculate average scores. Then, using only the top 100 propositions according to these scores, we crowdsource 10% of all possible pairwise comparisons among them. Using TrueSkill, we obtain a fine-grained ranking of the 100 most important propositions.\nFor Likert-scores, the average agreement over all topics is 0.80, while the majority agreement for comparisons is 0.78. We repeated the data collection for three randomly selected topics and found the Pearson correlation between both runs to be 0.73 (Spearman 0.73) for Likert-scores and 0.72 (Spearman 0.71) for comparisons. These figures show that the crowdsourcing approach works on this dataset as reliably as on the TAC documents.\nIn total, we uploaded 53k scoring and 12k comparison tasks to Mechanical Turk, spending $4425.45 including fees. From the fine-grained ranking of the 100 most important propositions, we select the top 50 per topic to construct a summary concept map in the subsequent steps.\nProposition Revision\nHaving a manageable number of propositions, an annotator then applied a few straightforward transformations that correct common errors of the Open IE system. First, we break down propositions with conjunctions in either of the arguments into separate propositions per conjunct, which the Open IE system sometimes fails to do. And second, we correct span errors that might occur in the argument or relation phrases, especially when sentences were not properly segmented. As a result, we have a set of high quality propositions for our concept map, consisting of, due to the first transformation, 56.1 propositions per topic on average.\nConcept Map Construction\nIn this final step, we connect the set of important propositions to form a graph. For instance, given the following two propositions\n(student, may borrow, Stafford Loan)\n(the student, does not have, a credit history)\none can easily see, although the first arguments differ slightly, that both labels describe the concept student, allowing us to build a concept map with the concepts student, Stafford Loan and credit history. The annotation task thus involves deciding which of the available propositions to include in the map, which of their concepts to merge and, when merging, which of the available labels to use. As these decisions highly depend upon each other and require context, we decided to use expert annotators rather than crowdsource the subtasks.\nAnnotators were given the topic description and the most important, ranked propositions. Using a simple annotation tool providing a visualization of the graph, they could connect the propositions step by step. They were instructed to reach a size of 25 concepts, the recommended maximum size for a concept map BIBREF6 . Further, they should prefer more important propositions and ensure connectedness. When connecting two propositions, they were asked to keep the concept label that was appropriate for both propositions. To support the annotators, the tool used ADW BIBREF40 , a state-of-the-art approach for semantic similarity, to suggest possible connections. The annotation was carried out by graduate students with a background in NLP after receiving an introduction into the guidelines and tool and annotating a first example.\nIf an annotator was not able to connect 25 concepts, she was allowed to create up to three synthetic relations with freely defined labels, making the maps slightly abstractive. On average, the constructed maps have 0.77 synthetic relations, mostly connecting concepts whose relation is too obvious to be explicitly stated in text (e.g. between Montessori teacher and Montessori education).\nTo assess the reliability of this annotation step, we had the first three maps created by two annotators. We casted the task of selecting propositions to be included in the map as a binary decision task and observed an agreement of 84% ( INLINEFORM0 ). Second, we modeled the decision which concepts to join as a binary decision on all pairs of common concepts, observing an agreement of 95% ( INLINEFORM1 ). And finally, we compared which concept labels the annotators decided to include in the final map, observing 85% ( INLINEFORM2 ) agreement. Hence, the annotation shows substantial agreement BIBREF41 .\nCorpus Analysis\nIn this section, we describe our newly created corpus, which, in addition to having summaries in the form of concept maps, differs from traditional summarization corpora in several aspects.\nDocument Clusters\nThe corpus consists of document clusters for 30 different topics. Each of them contains around 40 documents with on average 2413 tokens, which leads to an average cluster size of 97,880 token. With these characteristics, the document clusters are 15 times larger than typical DUC clusters of ten documents and five times larger than the 25-document-clusters (Table TABREF26 ). In addition, the documents are also more variable in terms of length, as the (length-adjusted) standard deviation is twice as high as in the other corpora. With these properties, the corpus represents an interesting challenge towards real-world application scenarios, in which users typically have to deal with much more than ten documents.\nBecause we used a large web crawl as the source for our corpus, it contains documents from a variety of genres. To further analyze this property, we categorized a sample of 50 documents from the corpus. Among them, we found professionally written articles and blog posts (28%), educational material for parents and kids (26%), personal blog posts (16%), forum discussions and comments (12%), commented link collections (12%) and scientific articles (6%).\nIn addition to the variety of genres, the documents also differ in terms of language use. To capture this property, we follow Zopf.2016 and compute, for every topic, the average Jensen-Shannon divergence between the word distribution of one document and the word distribution in the remaining documents. The higher this value is, the more the language differs between documents. We found the average divergence over all topics to be 0.3490, whereas it is 0.3019 in DUC 2004 and 0.3188 in TAC 2008A.\nConcept Maps\nAs Table TABREF33 shows, each of the 30 reference concept maps has exactly 25 concepts and between 24 and 28 relations. Labels for both concepts and relations consist on average of 3.2 tokens, whereas the latter are a bit shorter in characters.\nTo obtain a better picture of what kind of text spans have been used as labels, we automatically tagged them with their part-of-speech and determined their head with a dependency parser. Concept labels tend to be headed by nouns (82%) or verbs (15%), while they also contain adjectives, prepositions and determiners. Relation labels, on the other hand, are almost always headed by a verb (94%) and contain prepositions, nouns and particles in addition. These distributions are very similar to those reported by Villalon.2010 for their (single-document) concept map corpus.\nAnalyzing the graph structure of the maps, we found that all of them are connected. They have on average 7.2 central concepts with more than one relation, while the remaining ones occur in only one proposition. We found that achieving a higher number of connections would mean compromising importance, i.e. including less important propositions, and decided against it.\nBaseline Experiments\nIn this section, we briefly describe a baseline and evaluation scripts that we release, with a detailed documentation, along with the corpus.\nConclusion\nIn this work, we presented low-context importance annotation, a novel crowdsourcing scheme that we used to create a new benchmark corpus for concept-map-based MDS. The corpus has large-scale document clusters of heterogeneous web documents, posing a challenging summarization task. Together with the corpus, we provide implementations of a baseline method and evaluation scripts and hope that our efforts facilitate future research on this variant of summarization.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Teresa Botschen, Andreas Hanselowski and Markus Zopf for their help with the annotation work and Christian Meyer for his valuable feedback.

    "Introduction\nLanguage model pretraining has advanced the state of the art in many NLP tasks ranging from sentiment analysis, to question answering, natural language inference, named entity recognition, and textual similarity. State-of-the-art pretrained models include ELMo BIBREF1, GPT BIBREF2, and more recently Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (Bert; BIBREF0). Bert combines both word and sentence representations in a single very large Transformer BIBREF3; it is pretrained on vast amounts of text, with an unsupervised objective of masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction and can be fine-tuned with various task-specific objectives.\nIn most cases, pretrained language models have been employed as encoders for sentence- and paragraph-level natural language understanding problems BIBREF0 involving various classification tasks (e.g., predicting whether any two sentences are in an entailment relationship; or determining the completion of a sentence among four alternative sentences). In this paper, we examine the influence of language model pretraining on text summarization. Different from previous tasks, summarization requires wide-coverage natural language understanding going beyond the meaning of individual words and sentences. The aim is to condense a document into a shorter version while preserving most of its meaning. Furthermore, under abstractive modeling formulations, the task requires language generation capabilities in order to create summaries containing novel words and phrases not featured in the source text, while extractive summarization is often defined as a binary classification task with labels indicating whether a text span (typically a sentence) should be included in the summary.\nWe explore the potential of Bert for text summarization under a general framework encompassing both extractive and abstractive modeling paradigms. We propose a novel document-level encoder based on Bert which is able to encode a document and obtain representations for its sentences. Our extractive model is built on top of this encoder by stacking several inter-sentence Transformer layers to capture document-level features for extracting sentences. Our abstractive model adopts an encoder-decoder architecture, combining the same pretrained Bert encoder with a randomly-initialized Transformer decoder BIBREF3. We design a new training schedule which separates the optimizers of the encoder and the decoder in order to accommodate the fact that the former is pretrained while the latter must be trained from scratch. Finally, motivated by previous work showing that the combination of extractive and abstractive objectives can help generate better summaries BIBREF4, we present a two-stage approach where the encoder is fine-tuned twice, first with an extractive objective and subsequently on the abstractive summarization task.\nWe evaluate the proposed approach on three single-document news summarization datasets representative of different writing conventions (e.g., important information is concentrated at the beginning of the document or distributed more evenly throughout) and summary styles (e.g., verbose vs. more telegraphic; extractive vs. abstractive). Across datasets, we experimentally show that the proposed models achieve state-of-the-art results under both extractive and abstractive settings. Our contributions in this work are three-fold: a) we highlight the importance of document encoding for the summarization task; a variety of recently proposed techniques aim to enhance summarization performance via copying mechanisms BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7, reinforcement learning BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10, and multiple communicating encoders BIBREF11. We achieve better results with a minimum-requirement model without using any of these mechanisms; b) we showcase ways to effectively employ pretrained language models in summarization under both extractive and abstractive settings; we would expect any improvements in model pretraining to translate in better summarization in the future; and c) the proposed models can be used as a stepping stone to further improve summarization performance as well as baselines against which new proposals are tested.\nBackground ::: Pretrained Language Models\nPretrained language models BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF0, BIBREF12, BIBREF13 have recently emerged as a key technology for achieving impressive gains in a wide variety of natural language tasks. These models extend the idea of word embeddings by learning contextual representations from large-scale corpora using a language modeling objective. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (Bert; BIBREF0) is a new language representation model which is trained with a masked language modeling and a \u201cnext sentence prediction\u201d task on a corpus of 3,300M words.\nThe general architecture of Bert is shown in the left part of Figure FIGREF2. Input text is first preprocessed by inserting two special tokens. [cls] is appended to the beginning of the text; the output representation of this token is used to aggregate information from the whole sequence (e.g., for classification tasks). And token [sep] is inserted after each sentence as an indicator of sentence boundaries. The modified text is then represented as a sequence of tokens $X=[w_1,w_2,\\cdots ,w_n]$. Each token $w_i$ is assigned three kinds of embeddings: token embeddings indicate the meaning of each token, segmentation embeddings are used to discriminate between two sentences (e.g., during a sentence-pair classification task) and position embeddings indicate the position of each token within the text sequence. These three embeddings are summed to a single input vector $x_i$ and fed to a bidirectional Transformer with multiple layers:\nwhere $h^0=x$ are the input vectors; $\\mathrm {LN}$ is the layer normalization operation BIBREF14; $\\mathrm {MHAtt}$ is the multi-head attention operation BIBREF3; superscript $l$ indicates the depth of the stacked layer. On the top layer, Bert will generate an output vector $t_i$ for each token with rich contextual information.\nPretrained language models are usually used to enhance performance in language understanding tasks. Very recently, there have been attempts to apply pretrained models to various generation problems BIBREF15, BIBREF16. When fine-tuning for a specific task, unlike ELMo whose parameters are usually fixed, parameters in Bert are jointly fine-tuned with additional task-specific parameters.\nBackground ::: Extractive Summarization\nExtractive summarization systems create a summary by identifying (and subsequently concatenating) the most important sentences in a document. Neural models consider extractive summarization as a sentence classification problem: a neural encoder creates sentence representations and a classifier predicts which sentences should be selected as summaries. SummaRuNNer BIBREF7 is one of the earliest neural approaches adopting an encoder based on Recurrent Neural Networks. Refresh BIBREF8 is a reinforcement learning-based system trained by globally optimizing the ROUGE metric. More recent work achieves higher performance with more sophisticated model structures. Latent BIBREF17 frames extractive summarization as a latent variable inference problem; instead of maximizing the likelihood of \u201cgold\u201d standard labels, their latent model directly maximizes the likelihood of human summaries given selected sentences. Sumo BIBREF18 capitalizes on the notion of structured attention to induce a multi-root dependency tree representation of the document while predicting the output summary. NeuSum BIBREF19 scores and selects sentences jointly and represents the state of the art in extractive summarization.\nBackground ::: Abstractive Summarization\nNeural approaches to abstractive summarization conceptualize the task as a sequence-to-sequence problem, where an encoder maps a sequence of tokens in the source document $\\mathbf {x} = [x_1, ..., x_n]$ to a sequence of continuous representations $\\mathbf {z} = [z_1, ..., z_n]$, and a decoder then generates the target summary $\\mathbf {y} = [y_1, ..., y_m]$ token-by-token, in an auto-regressive manner, hence modeling the conditional probability: $p(y_1, ..., y_m|x_1, ..., x_n)$.\nBIBREF20 and BIBREF21 were among the first to apply the neural encoder-decoder architecture to text summarization. BIBREF6 enhance this model with a pointer-generator network (PTgen) which allows it to copy words from the source text, and a coverage mechanism (Cov) which keeps track of words that have been summarized. BIBREF11 propose an abstractive system where multiple agents (encoders) represent the document together with a hierarchical attention mechanism (over the agents) for decoding. Their Deep Communicating Agents (DCA) model is trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning. BIBREF9 also present a deep reinforced model (DRM) for abstractive summarization which handles the coverage problem with an intra-attention mechanism where the decoder attends over previously generated words. BIBREF4 follow a bottom-up approach (BottomUp); a content selector first determines which phrases in the source document should be part of the summary, and a copy mechanism is applied only to preselected phrases during decoding. BIBREF22 propose an abstractive model which is particularly suited to extreme summarization (i.e., single sentence summaries), based on convolutional neural networks and additionally conditioned on topic distributions (TConvS2S).\nFine-tuning Bert for Summarization ::: Summarization Encoder\nAlthough Bert has been used to fine-tune various NLP tasks, its application to summarization is not as straightforward. Since Bert is trained as a masked-language model, the output vectors are grounded to tokens instead of sentences, while in extractive summarization, most models manipulate sentence-level representations. Although segmentation embeddings represent different sentences in Bert, they only apply to sentence-pair inputs, while in summarization we must encode and manipulate multi-sentential inputs. Figure FIGREF2 illustrates our proposed Bert architecture for Summarization (which we call BertSum).\nIn order to represent individual sentences, we insert external [cls] tokens at the start of each sentence, and each [cls] symbol collects features for the sentence preceding it. We also use interval segment embeddings to distinguish multiple sentences within a document. For $sent_i$ we assign segment embedding $E_A$ or $E_B$ depending on whether $i$ is odd or even. For example, for document $[sent_1, sent_2, sent_3, sent_4, sent_5]$, we would assign embeddings $[E_A, E_B, E_A,E_B, E_A]$. This way, document representations are learned hierarchically where lower Transformer layers represent adjacent sentences, while higher layers, in combination with self-attention, represent multi-sentence discourse.\nPosition embeddings in the original Bert model have a maximum length of 512; we overcome this limitation by adding more position embeddings that are initialized randomly and fine-tuned with other parameters in the encoder.\nFine-tuning Bert for Summarization ::: Extractive Summarization\nLet $d$ denote a document containing sentences $[sent_1, sent_2, \\cdots , sent_m]$, where $sent_i$ is the $i$-th sentence in the document. Extractive summarization can be defined as the task of assigning a label $y_i \\in \\lbrace 0, 1\\rbrace $ to each $sent_i$, indicating whether the sentence should be included in the summary. It is assumed that summary sentences represent the most important content of the document.\nWith BertSum, vector $t_i$ which is the vector of the $i$-th [cls] symbol from the top layer can be used as the representation for $sent_i$. Several inter-sentence Transformer layers are then stacked on top of Bert outputs, to capture document-level features for extracting summaries:\nwhere $h^0=\\mathrm {PosEmb}(T)$; $T$ denotes the sentence vectors output by BertSum, and function $\\mathrm {PosEmb}$ adds sinusoid positional embeddings BIBREF3 to $T$, indicating the position of each sentence.\nThe final output layer is a sigmoid classifier:\nwhere $h^L_i$ is the vector for $sent_i$ from the top layer (the $L$-th layer ) of the Transformer. In experiments, we implemented Transformers with $L=1, 2, 3$ and found that a Transformer with $L=2$ performed best. We name this model BertSumExt.\nThe loss of the model is the binary classification entropy of prediction $\\hat{y}_i$ against gold label $y_i$. Inter-sentence Transformer layers are jointly fine-tuned with BertSum. We use the Adam optimizer with $\\beta _1=0.9$, and $\\beta _2=0.999$). Our learning rate schedule follows BIBREF3 with warming-up ($ \\operatorname{\\operatorname{warmup}}=10,000$):\nFine-tuning Bert for Summarization ::: Abstractive Summarization\nWe use a standard encoder-decoder framework for abstractive summarization BIBREF6. The encoder is the pretrained BertSum and the decoder is a 6-layered Transformer initialized randomly. It is conceivable that there is a mismatch between the encoder and the decoder, since the former is pretrained while the latter must be trained from scratch. This can make fine-tuning unstable; for example, the encoder might overfit the data while the decoder underfits, or vice versa. To circumvent this, we design a new fine-tuning schedule which separates the optimizers of the encoder and the decoder.\nWe use two Adam optimizers with $\\beta _1=0.9$ and $\\beta _2=0.999$ for the encoder and the decoder, respectively, each with different warmup-steps and learning rates:\nwhere $\\tilde{lr}_{\\mathcal {E}}=2e^{-3}$, and $\\operatorname{\\operatorname{warmup}}_{\\mathcal {E}}=20,000$ for the encoder and $\\tilde{lr}_{\\mathcal {D}}=0.1$, and $\\operatorname{\\operatorname{warmup}}_{\\mathcal {D}}=10,000$ for the decoder. This is based on the assumption that the pretrained encoder should be fine-tuned with a smaller learning rate and smoother decay (so that the encoder can be trained with more accurate gradients when the decoder is becoming stable).\nIn addition, we propose a two-stage fine-tuning approach, where we first fine-tune the encoder on the extractive summarization task (Section SECREF8) and then fine-tune it on the abstractive summarization task (Section SECREF13). Previous work BIBREF4, BIBREF23 suggests that using extractive objectives can boost the performance of abstractive summarization. Also notice that this two-stage approach is conceptually very simple, the model can take advantage of information shared between these two tasks, without fundamentally changing its architecture. We name the default abstractive model BertSumAbs and the two-stage fine-tuned model BertSumExtAbs.\nExperimental Setup\nIn this section, we describe the summarization datasets used in our experiments and discuss various implementation details.\nExperimental Setup ::: Summarization Datasets\nWe evaluated our model on three benchmark datasets, namely the CNN/DailyMail news highlights dataset BIBREF24, the New York Times Annotated Corpus (NYT; BIBREF25), and XSum BIBREF22. These datasets represent different summary styles ranging from highlights to very brief one sentence summaries. The summaries also vary with respect to the type of rewriting operations they exemplify (e.g., some showcase more cut and paste operations while others are genuinely abstractive). Table TABREF12 presents statistics on these datasets (test set); example (gold-standard) summaries are provided in the supplementary material.\nExperimental Setup ::: Summarization Datasets ::: CNN/DailyMail\ncontains news articles and associated highlights, i.e., a few bullet points giving a brief overview of the article. We used the standard splits of BIBREF24 for training, validation, and testing (90,266/1,220/1,093 CNN documents and 196,961/12,148/10,397 DailyMail documents). We did not anonymize entities. We first split sentences with the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit BIBREF26 and pre-processed the dataset following BIBREF6. Input documents were truncated to 512 tokens.\nExperimental Setup ::: Summarization Datasets ::: NYT\ncontains 110,540 articles with abstractive summaries. Following BIBREF27, we split these into 100,834/9,706 training/test examples, based on the date of publication (the test set contains all articles published from January 1, 2007 onward). We used 4,000 examples from the training as validation set. We also followed their filtering procedure, documents with summaries less than 50 words were removed from the dataset. The filtered test set (NYT50) includes 3,452 examples. Sentences were split with the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit BIBREF26 and pre-processed following BIBREF27. Input documents were truncated to 800 tokens.\nExperimental Setup ::: Summarization Datasets ::: XSum\ncontains 226,711 news articles accompanied with a one-sentence summary, answering the question \u201cWhat is this article about?\u201d. We used the splits of BIBREF22 for training, validation, and testing (204,045/11,332/11,334) and followed the pre-processing introduced in their work. Input documents were truncated to 512 tokens.\nAside from various statistics on the three datasets, Table TABREF12 also reports the proportion of novel bi-grams in gold summaries as a measure of their abstractiveness. We would expect models with extractive biases to perform better on datasets with (mostly) extractive summaries, and abstractive models to perform more rewrite operations on datasets with abstractive summaries. CNN/DailyMail and NYT are somewhat abstractive, while XSum is highly abstractive.\nExperimental Setup ::: Implementation Details\nFor both extractive and abstractive settings, we used PyTorch, OpenNMT BIBREF28 and the `bert-base-uncased' version of Bert to implement BertSum. Both source and target texts were tokenized with Bert's subwords tokenizer.\nExperimental Setup ::: Implementation Details ::: Extractive Summarization\nAll extractive models were trained for 50,000 steps on 3 GPUs (GTX 1080 Ti) with gradient accumulation every two steps. Model checkpoints were saved and evaluated on the validation set every 1,000 steps. We selected the top-3 checkpoints based on the evaluation loss on the validation set, and report the averaged results on the test set. We used a greedy algorithm similar to BIBREF7 to obtain an oracle summary for each document to train extractive models. The algorithm generates an oracle consisting of multiple sentences which maximize the ROUGE-2 score against the gold summary.\nWhen predicting summaries for a new document, we first use the model to obtain the score for each sentence. We then rank these sentences by their scores from highest to lowest, and select the top-3 sentences as the summary.\nDuring sentence selection we use Trigram Blocking to reduce redundancy BIBREF9. Given summary $S$ and candidate sentence $c$, we skip $c$ if there exists a trigram overlapping between $c$ and $S$. The intuition is similar to Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR; BIBREF29); we wish to minimize the similarity between the sentence being considered and sentences which have been already selected as part of the summary.\nExperimental Setup ::: Implementation Details ::: Abstractive Summarization\nIn all abstractive models, we applied dropout (with probability $0.1$) before all linear layers; label smoothing BIBREF30 with smoothing factor $0.1$ was also used. Our Transformer decoder has 768 hidden units and the hidden size for all feed-forward layers is 2,048. All models were trained for 200,000 steps on 4 GPUs (GTX 1080 Ti) with gradient accumulation every five steps. Model checkpoints were saved and evaluated on the validation set every 2,500 steps. We selected the top-3 checkpoints based on their evaluation loss on the validation set, and report the averaged results on the test set.\nDuring decoding we used beam search (size 5), and tuned the $\\alpha $ for the length penalty BIBREF31 between $0.6$ and 1 on the validation set; we decode until an end-of-sequence token is emitted and repeated trigrams are blocked BIBREF9. It is worth noting that our decoder applies neither a copy nor a coverage mechanism BIBREF6, despite their popularity in abstractive summarization. This is mainly because we focus on building a minimum-requirements model and these mechanisms may introduce additional hyper-parameters to tune. Thanks to the subwords tokenizer, we also rarely observe issues with out-of-vocabulary words in the output; moreover, trigram-blocking produces diverse summaries managing to reduce repetitions.\nResults ::: Automatic Evaluation\nWe evaluated summarization quality automatically using ROUGE BIBREF32. We report unigram and bigram overlap (ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2) as a means of assessing informativeness and the longest common subsequence (ROUGE-L) as a means of assessing fluency. Table TABREF23 summarizes our results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset. The first block in the table includes the results of an extractive Oracle system as an upper bound. We also present the Lead-3 baseline (which simply selects the first three sentences in a document). The second block in the table includes various extractive models trained on the CNN/DailyMail dataset (see Section SECREF5 for an overview). For comparison to our own model, we also implemented a non-pretrained Transformer baseline (TransformerExt) which uses the same architecture as BertSumExt, but with fewer parameters. It is randomly initialized and only trained on the summarization task. TransformerExt has 6 layers, the hidden size is 512, and the feed-forward filter size is 2,048. The model was trained with same settings as in BIBREF3. The third block in Table TABREF23 highlights the performance of several abstractive models on the CNN/DailyMail dataset (see Section SECREF6 for an overview). We also include an abstractive Transformer baseline (TransformerAbs) which has the same decoder as our abstractive BertSum models; the encoder is a 6-layer Transformer with 768 hidden size and 2,048 feed-forward filter size. The fourth block reports results with fine-tuned Bert models: BertSumExt and its two variants (one without interval embeddings, and one with the large version of Bert), BertSumAbs, and BertSumExtAbs. Bert-based models outperform the Lead-3 baseline which is not a strawman; on the CNN/DailyMail corpus it is indeed superior to several extractive BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF19 and abstractive models BIBREF6. Bert models collectively outperform all previously proposed extractive and abstractive systems, only falling behind the Oracle upper bound. Among Bert variants, BertSumExt performs best which is not entirely surprising; CNN/DailyMail summaries are somewhat extractive and even abstractive models are prone to copying sentences from the source document when trained on this dataset BIBREF6. Perhaps unsurprisingly we observe that larger versions of Bert lead to performance improvements and that interval embeddings bring only slight gains. Table TABREF24 presents results on the NYT dataset. Following the evaluation protocol in BIBREF27, we use limited-length ROUGE Recall, where predicted summaries are truncated to the length of the gold summaries. Again, we report the performance of the Oracle upper bound and Lead-3 baseline. The second block in the table contains previously proposed extractive models as well as our own Transformer baseline. Compress BIBREF27 is an ILP-based model which combines compression and anaphoricity constraints. The third block includes abstractive models from the literature, and our Transformer baseline. Bert-based models are shown in the fourth block. Again, we observe that they outperform previously proposed approaches. On this dataset, abstractive Bert models generally perform better compared to BertSumExt, almost approaching Oracle performance.\nTable TABREF26 summarizes our results on the XSum dataset. Recall that summaries in this dataset are highly abstractive (see Table TABREF12) consisting of a single sentence conveying the gist of the document. Extractive models here perform poorly as corroborated by the low performance of the Lead baseline (which simply selects the leading sentence from the document), and the Oracle (which selects a single-best sentence in each document) in Table TABREF26. As a result, we do not report results for extractive models on this dataset. The second block in Table TABREF26 presents the results of various abstractive models taken from BIBREF22 and also includes our own abstractive Transformer baseline. In the third block we show the results of our Bert summarizers which again are superior to all previously reported models (by a wide margin).\nResults ::: Model Analysis ::: Learning Rates\nRecall that our abstractive model uses separate optimizers for the encoder and decoder. In Table TABREF27 we examine whether the combination of different learning rates ($\\tilde{lr}_{\\mathcal {E}}$ and $\\tilde{lr}_{\\mathcal {D}}$) is indeed beneficial. Specifically, we report model perplexity on the CNN/DailyMail validation set for varying encoder/decoder learning rates. We can see that the model performs best with $\\tilde{lr}_{\\mathcal {E}}=2e-3$ and $\\tilde{lr}_{\\mathcal {D}}=0.1$.\nResults ::: Model Analysis ::: Position of Extracted Sentences\nIn addition to the evaluation based on ROUGE, we also analyzed in more detail the summaries produced by our model. For the extractive setting, we looked at the position (in the source document) of the sentences which were selected to appear in the summary. Figure FIGREF31 shows the proportion of selected summary sentences which appear in the source document at positions 1, 2, and so on. The analysis was conducted on the CNN/DailyMail dataset for Oracle summaries, and those produced by BertSumExt and the TransformerExt. We can see that Oracle summary sentences are fairly smoothly distributed across documents, while summaries created by TransformerExt mostly concentrate on the first document sentences. BertSumExt outputs are more similar to Oracle summaries, indicating that with the pretrained encoder, the model relies less on shallow position features, and learns deeper document representations.\nResults ::: Model Analysis ::: Novel N-grams\nWe also analyzed the output of abstractive systems by calculating the proportion of novel n-grams that appear in the summaries but not in the source texts. The results are shown in Figure FIGREF33. In the CNN/DailyMail dataset, the proportion of novel n-grams in automatically generated summaries is much lower compared to reference summaries, but in XSum, this gap is much smaller. We also observe that on CNN/DailyMail, BertExtAbs produces less novel n-ngrams than BertAbs, which is not surprising. BertExtAbs is more biased towards selecting sentences from the source document since it is initially trained as an extractive model. The supplementary material includes examples of system output and additional ablation studies.\nResults ::: Human Evaluation\nIn addition to automatic evaluation, we also evaluated system output by eliciting human judgments. We report experiments following a question-answering (QA) paradigm BIBREF33, BIBREF8 which quantifies the degree to which summarization models retain key information from the document. Under this paradigm, a set of questions is created based on the gold summary under the assumption that it highlights the most important document content. Participants are then asked to answer these questions by reading system summaries alone without access to the article. The more questions a system can answer, the better it is at summarizing the document as a whole. Moreover, we also assessed the overall quality of the summaries produced by abstractive systems which due to their ability to rewrite content may produce disfluent or ungrammatical output. Specifically, we followed the Best-Worst Scaling BIBREF34 method where participants were presented with the output of two systems (and the original document) and asked to decide which one was better according to the criteria of Informativeness, Fluency, and Succinctness.\nBoth types of evaluation were conducted on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. For the CNN/DailyMail and NYT datasets we used the same documents (20 in total) and questions from previous work BIBREF8, BIBREF18. For XSum, we randomly selected 20 documents (and their questions) from the release of BIBREF22. We elicited 3 responses per HIT. With regard to QA evaluation, we adopted the scoring mechanism from BIBREF33; correct answers were marked with a score of one, partially correct answers with 0.5, and zero otherwise. For quality-based evaluation, the rating of each system was computed as the percentage of times it was chosen as better minus the times it was selected as worse. Ratings thus range from -1 (worst) to 1 (best).\nResults for extractive and abstractive systems are shown in Tables TABREF37 and TABREF38, respectively. We compared the best performing BertSum model in each setting (extractive or abstractive) against various state-of-the-art systems (whose output is publicly available), the Lead baseline, and the Gold standard as an upper bound. As shown in both tables participants overwhelmingly prefer the output of our model against comparison systems across datasets and evaluation paradigms. All differences between BertSum and comparison models are statistically significant ($p<0.05$), with the exception of TConvS2S (see Table TABREF38; XSum) in the QA evaluation setting.\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we showcased how pretrained Bert can be usefully applied in text summarization. We introduced a novel document-level encoder and proposed a general framework for both abstractive and extractive summarization. Experimental results across three datasets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results across the board under automatic and human-based evaluation protocols. Although we mainly focused on document encoding for summarization, in the future, we would like to take advantage the capabilities of Bert for language generation.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research is supported by a Google PhD Fellowship to the first author.

    "Introduction\nLanguage modelling in its inception had one-hot vector encoding of words. However, it captures only alphabetic ordering but not the word semantic similarity. Vector space models helps to learn word representations in a lower dimensional space and also captures semantic similarity. Learning word embedding aids in natural language processing tasks such as question answering and reasoning BIBREF0, stance detection BIBREF1, claim verification BIBREF2.\nRecent models BIBREF3, BIBREF4 work on the basis that words with similar context share semantic similarity. BIBREF4 proposes a neural probabilistic model which models the target word probability conditioned on the previous words using a recurrent neural network. Word2Vec models BIBREF3 such as continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) predict the target word given the context, and skip-gram model works in reverse of predicting the context given the target word. While, GloVe embeddings were based on a Global matrix factorization on local contexts BIBREF5. However, the aforementioned models do not handle words with multiple meanings (polysemies).\nBIBREF6 proposes a neural network approach considering both local and global contexts in learning word embeddings (point estimates). Their multiple prototype model handles polysemous words by providing apriori heuristics about word senses in the dataset. BIBREF7 proposes an alternative to handle polysemous words by a modified skip-gram model and EM algorithm. BIBREF8 presents a non-parametric based alternative to handle polysemies. However, these approaches fail to consider entailment relations among the words. BIBREF9 learn a Gaussian distribution per word using the expected likelihood kernel. However, for polysemous words, this may lead to word distributions with larger variances as it may have to cover various senses.\nBIBREF10 proposes multimodal word distribution approach. It captures polysemy. However, the energy based objective function fails to consider asymmetry and hence entailment. Textual entailment recognition is necessary to capture lexical inference relations such as causality (for example, mosquito $\\rightarrow $ malaria), hypernymy (for example, dog $\\models $ animal) etc.\nIn this paper, we propose to obtain multi-sense word embedding distributions by using a variant of max margin objective based on the asymmetric KL divergence energy function to capture textual entailment. Multi-sense distributions are advantageous in capturing polysemous nature of words and in reducing the uncertainty per word by distributing it across senses. However, computing KL divergence between mixtures of Gaussians is intractable, and we use a KL divergence approximation based on stricter upper and lower bounds. While capturing textual entailment (asymmetry), we have also not compromised on capturing symmetrical similarity between words (for example, funny and hilarious) which will be elucidated in Section $3.1$. We also show the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the benchmark word similarity and entailment datasets in the experimental section.\nMethodology ::: Word Representation\nProbabilistic representation of words helps one model uncertainty in word representation, and polysemy. Given a corpus $V$, containing a list of words each represented as $w$, the probability density for a word $w$ can be represented as a mixture of Gaussians with $C$ components BIBREF10.\nHere, $p_{w,j}$ represents the probability of word $w$ belonging to the component $j$, $\\operatorname{\\mathbf {\\mu }}_{w,j}$ represents $D$ dimensional word representation corresponding to the $j^{th}$ component sense of the word $w$, and $\\Sigma _{w,j}$ represents the uncertainty in representation for word $w$ belonging to component $j$.\nObjective function\nThe model parameters (means, covariances and mixture weights) $\\theta $ can be learnt using a variant of max-margin objective BIBREF11.\nHere $E_\\theta (\\cdot , \\cdot )$ represents an energy function which assigns a score to the pair of words, $w$ is a particular word under consideration, $c$ its positive context (same context), and $c^{\\prime }$ the negative context. The objective aims to push the margin of the difference between the energy function of a word $w$ to its positive context $c$ higher than its negative context $c$ by a threshold of $m$. Thus, word pairs in the same context gets a higher energy than the word pairs in the dissimilar context. BIBREF10 consider the energy function to be an expected likelihood kernel which is defined as follows.\nThis is similar to the cosine similarity metric over vectors and the energy between two words is maximum when they have similar distributions. But, the expected likelihood kernel is a symmetric metric which will not be suitable for capturing ordering among words and hence entailment.\nObjective function ::: Proposed Energy function\nAs each word is represented by a mixture of Gaussian distributions, KL divergence is a better choice of energy function to capture distance between distributions. Since, KL divergence is minimum when the distributions are similar and maximum when they are dissimilar, energy function is taken as exponentiated negative KL divergence.\nHowever, computing KL divergence between Gaussian mixtures is intractable and obtaining exact KL value is not possible. One way of approximating the KL is by Monte-Carlo approximation but it requires large number of samples to get a good approximation and is computationally expensive on high dimensional embedding space.\nAlternatively, BIBREF12 presents a KL approximation between Gaussian mixtures where they obtain an upper bound through product of Gaussian approximation method and a lower bound through variational approximation method. In BIBREF13, the authors combine the lower and upper bounds from approximation methods of BIBREF12 to provide a stricter bound on KL between Gaussian mixtures. Lets consider Gaussian mixtures for the words $w$ and $v$ as follows.\nThe approximate KL divergence between the Gaussian mixture representations over the words $w$ and $v$ is shown in equation DISPLAY_FORM8. More details on approximation is included in the Supplementary Material.\nwhere $EL_{ik}(w,w) = \\int f_{w,i} (\\operatorname{\\mathbf {x}}) f_{w,k} (\\operatorname{\\mathbf {x}}) d\\operatorname{\\mathbf {x}}$ and $EL_{ij}(w,v) = \\int f_{w,i} (\\operatorname{\\mathbf {x}}) f_{v,k} (\\operatorname{\\mathbf {x}}) d\\operatorname{\\mathbf {x}}$. Note that the expected likelihood kernel appears component wise inside the approximate KL divergence derivation.\nOne advantage of using KL as energy function is that it enables to capture asymmetry in entailment datasets. For eg., let us consider the words 'chair' with two senses as 'bench' and 'sling', and 'wood' with two senses as 'trees' and 'furniture'. The word chair ($w$) is entailed within wood ($v$), i.e. chair $\\models $ wood. Now, minimizing the KL divergence necessitates maximizing $\\log {\\sum _j p_{v,j} \\exp ({-KL(f_{w,i} (\\operatorname{\\mathbf {x}})||f_{v,j}(\\operatorname{\\mathbf {x}}))})}$ which in turn minimizes $KL(f_{w,i}(\\operatorname{\\mathbf {x}})||f_{v,j}(\\operatorname{\\mathbf {x}}))$. This will result in the support of the $i^{th}$ component of $w$ to be within the $j^{th}$ component of $v$, and holds for all component pairs leading to the entailment of $w$ within $v$. Consequently, we can see that bench $\\models $ trees, bench $\\models $ furniture, sling $\\models $ trees, and sling $\\models $ furniture. Thus, it introduces lexical relationship between the senses of child word and that of the parent word. Minimizing the KL also necessitates maximizing $\\log {\\sum _j {p_{v,j}} EL_{ij}(w,v)}$ term for all component pairs among $w$ and $v$. This is similar to maximizing expected likelihood kernel, which brings the means of $f_{w,i}(\\operatorname{\\mathbf {x}})$ and $f_{v,j}(\\operatorname{\\mathbf {x}})$ closer (weighted by their co-variances) as discussed in BIBREF10. Hence, the proposed approach captures the best of both worlds, thereby catering to both word similarity and entailment.\nWe also note that minimizing the KL divergence necessitates minimizing $\\log {\\sum _k p_{w,k} \\exp ({-KL(f_{w,i}||f_{w,k})})}$ which in turn maximizes $KL(f_{w,i}||f_{w,k})$. This prevents the different mixture components of a word converging to single Gaussian and encourages capturing different possible senses of the word. The same is also achieved by minimizing $\\sum _k {p_{w,k}} EL_{ik}(w,w)$ term and act as a regularization term which promotes diversity in learning senses of a word.\nExperimentation and Results\nWe train our proposed model GM$\\_$KL (Gaussian Mixture using KL Divergence) on the Text8 dataset BIBREF14 which is a pre-processed data of $17M$ words from wikipedia. Of which, 71290 unique and frequent words are chosen using the subsampling trick in BIBREF15. We compare GM$\\_$KL with the previous approaches w2g BIBREF9 ( single Gaussian model) and w2gm BIBREF10 (mixture of Gaussian model with expected likelihood kernel). For all the models used for experimentation, the embedding size ($D$) was set to 50, number of mixtures to 2, context window length to 10, batch size to 128. The word embeddings were initialized using a uniform distribution in the range of $[-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{D}}$, $\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{D}}]$ such that the expectation of variance is 1 and mean 0 BIBREF16. One could also consider initializing the word embeddings using other contextual representations such as BERT BIBREF17 and ELMo BIBREF18 in the proposed approach. In order to purely analyze the performance of $\\emph {GM\\_KL}$ over the other models, we have chosen initialization using uniform distribution for experiments. For computational benefits, diagonal covariance is used similar to BIBREF10. Each mixture probability is constrained in the range $[0,1]$, summing to 1 by optimizing over unconstrained scores in the range $(-\\infty ,\\infty )$ and converting scores to probability using softmax function. The mixture scores are initialized to 0 to ensure fairness among all the components. The threshold for negative sampling was set to $10^{-5}$, as recommended in BIBREF3. Mini-batch gradient descent with Adagrad optimizer BIBREF19 was used with initial learning rate set to $0.05$.\nTable TABREF9 shows the qualitative results of GM$\\_$KL. Given a query word and component id, the set of nearest neighbours along with their respective component ids are listed. For eg., the word `plane' in its 0th component captures the `geometry' sense and so are its neighbours, and its 1st component captures `vehicle' sense and so are its corresponding neighbours. Other words such as `rock' captures both the `metal' and `music' senses, `star' captures `celebrity' and `astronomical' senses, and `phone' captures `telephony' and `internet' senses.\nWe quantitatively compare the performance of the GM$\\_$KL, w2g, and w2gm approaches on the SCWS dataset BIBREF6. The dataset consists of 2003 word pairs of polysemous and homonymous words with labels obtained by an average of 10 human scores. The Spearman correlation between the human scores and the model scores are computed. To obtain the model score, the following metrics are used:\nMaxCos: Maximum cosine similarity among all component pairs of words $w$ and $v$:\nAvgCos: Average component-wise cosine similarity between the words $w$ and $v$.\nKL$\\_$approx: Formulated as shown in (DISPLAY_FORM8) between the words $w$ and $v$.\nKL$\\_$comp: Maximum component-wise negative KL between words $w$ and $v$:\nTable TABREF17 compares the performance of the approaches on the SCWS dataset. It is evident from Table TABREF17 that GM$\\_$KL achieves better correlation than existing approaches for various metrics on SCWS dataset.\nTable TABREF18 shows the Spearman correlation values of GM$\\_$KL model evaluated on the benchmark word similarity datasets: SL BIBREF20, WS, WS-R, WS-S BIBREF21, MEN BIBREF22, MC BIBREF23, RG BIBREF24, YP BIBREF25, MTurk-287 and MTurk-771 BIBREF26, BIBREF27, and RW BIBREF28. The metric used for comparison is 'AvgCos'. It can be seen that for most of the datasets, GM$\\_$KL achieves significantly better correlation score than w2g and w2gm approaches. Other datasets such as MC and RW consist of only a single sense, and hence w2g model performs better and GM$\\_$KL achieves next better performance. The YP dataset have multiple senses but does not contain entailed data and hence could not make use of entailment benefits of GM$\\_$KL.\nTable TABREF19 shows the evaluation results of GM$\\_$KL model on the entailment datasets such as entailment pairs dataset BIBREF29 created from WordNet with both positive and negative labels, a crowdsourced dataset BIBREF30 of 79 semantic relations labelled as entailed or not and annotated distributionally similar nouns dataset BIBREF31. The 'MaxCos' similarity metric is used for evaluation and the best precision and best F1-score is shown, by picking the optimal threshold. Overall, GM$\\_$KL performs better than both w2g and w2gm approaches.\nConclusion\nWe proposed a KL divergence based energy function for learning multi-sense word embedding distributions modelled as Gaussian mixtures. Due to the intractability of the Gaussian mixtures for the KL divergence measure, we use an approximate KL divergence function. We also demonstrated that the proposed GM$\\_$KL approaches performed better than other approaches on the benchmark word similarity and entailment datasets.\ntocsectionAppendices\nApproximation for KL divergence between mixtures of gaussians\nKL between gaussian mixtures $f_{w}(\\operatorname{\\mathbf {x}})$ and $f_{v}(\\operatorname{\\mathbf {x}})$ can be decomposed as:\nBIBREF12 presents KL approximation between gaussian mixtures using\nproduct of gaussian approximation method where KL is approximated using product of component gaussians and\nvariational approximation method where KL is approximated by introducing some variational parameters.\nThe product of component gaussian approximation method using Jensen's inequality provides upper bounds as shown in equations DISPLAY_FORM23 and .\nThe variational approximation method provides lower bounds as shown in equations DISPLAY_FORM24 and DISPLAY_FORM25.\nwhere $H$ represents the entropy term and the entropy of $i^{th}$ component of word $w$ with dimension $D$ is given as\nIn BIBREF13, the authors combine the lower and upper bounds from approximation methods of BIBREF12 to formulate a stricter bound on KL between gaussian mixtures.\nFrom equations DISPLAY_FORM23 and DISPLAY_FORM25, a stricter lower bound for KL between gaussian mixtures is obtained as shown in equation DISPLAY_FORM26\nFrom equations and DISPLAY_FORM24, a stricter upper bound for KL between gaussian mixtures is obtained as shown in equation DISPLAY_FORM27\nFinally, the KL between gaussian mixtures is taken as the mean of KL upper and lower bounds as shown in equation DISPLAY_FORM28.",
    "Introduction\nSince humans amass more and more generally available data in the form of unstructured text it would be very useful to teach machines to read and comprehend such data and then use this understanding to answer our questions. A significant amount of research has recently focused on answering one particular kind of questions the answer to which depends on understanding a context document. These are cloze-style questions BIBREF0 which require the reader to fill in a missing word in a sentence. An important advantage of such questions is that they can be generated automatically from a suitable text corpus which allows us to produce a practically unlimited amount of them. That opens the task to notoriously data-hungry deep-learning techniques which now seem to outperform all alternative approaches.\nTwo such large-scale datasets have recently been proposed by researchers from Google DeepMind and Facebook AI: the CNN/Daily Mail dataset BIBREF1 and the Children's Book Test (CBT) BIBREF2 respectively. These have attracted a lot of attention from the research community BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 with a new state-of-the-art model coming out every few weeks.\nHowever if our goal is a production-level system actually capable of helping humans, we want the model to use all available resources as efficiently as possible. Given that\nwe believe that if the community is striving to bring the performance as far as possible, it should move its work to larger data.\nThis thinking goes in line with recent developments in the area of language modelling. For a long time models were being compared on several \"standard\" datasets with publications often presenting minuscule improvements in performance. Then the large-scale One Billion Word corpus dataset appeared BIBREF15 and it allowed Jozefowicz et al. to train much larger LSTM models BIBREF16 that almost halved the state-of-the-art perplexity on this dataset.\nWe think it is time to make a similar step in the area of text comprehension. Hence we are introducing the BookTest, a new dataset very similar to the Children's Book test but more than 60 times larger to enable training larger models even in the domain of text comprehension. Furthermore the methodology used to create our data can later be used to create even larger datasets when the need arises thanks to further technological progress.\nWe show that if we evaluate a model trained on the new dataset on the now standard Children's Book Test dataset, we see an improvement in accuracy much larger than other research groups achieved by enhancing the model architecture itself (while still using the original CBT training data). By training on the new dataset, we reduce the prediction error by almost one third. On the named-entity version of CBT this brings the ensemble of our models to the level of human baseline as reported by Facebook BIBREF2 . However in the final section we show in our own human study that there is still room for improvement on the CBT beyond the performance of our model.\nTask Description\nA natural way of testing a reader's comprehension of a text is to ask her a question the answer to which can be deduced from the text. Hence the task we are trying to solve consists of answering a cloze-style question, the answer to which depends on the understanding of a context document provided with the question. The model is also provided with a set of possible answers from which the correct one is to be selected. This can be formalized as follows:\nThe training data consist of tuples INLINEFORM0 , where INLINEFORM1 is a question, INLINEFORM2 is a document that contains the answer to question INLINEFORM3 , INLINEFORM4 is a set of possible answers and INLINEFORM5 is the ground-truth answer. Both INLINEFORM6 and INLINEFORM7 are sequences of words from vocabulary INLINEFORM8 . We also assume that all possible answers are words from the vocabulary, that is INLINEFORM9 . In the CBT and CNN/Daily Mail datasets it is also true that the ground-truth answer INLINEFORM10 appears in the document. This is exploited by many machine learning models BIBREF2 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , however some do not explicitly depend on this property BIBREF1 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF9\nCurrent Landscape\nWe will now briefly review what datasets for text comprehension have been published up to date and look at models which have been recently applied to solving the task we have just described.\nDatasets\nA crucial condition for applying deep-learning techniques is to have a huge amount of data available for training. For question answering this specifically means having a large number of document-question-answer triples available. While there is an unlimited amount of text available, coming up with relevant questions and the corresponding answers can be extremely labour-intensive if done by human annotators. There were efforts to provide such human-generated datasets, e.g. Microsoft's MCTest BIBREF17 , however their scale is not suitable for deep learning without pre-training on other data BIBREF18 (such as using pre-trained word embedding vectors).\nGoogle DeepMind managed to avoid this scale issue with their way of generating document-question-answer triples automatically, closely followed by Facebook with a similar method. Let us now briefly introduce the two resulting datasets whose properties are summarized in Table TABREF8 .\nThese two datasets BIBREF1 exploit a useful feature of online news articles \u2013 many articles include a short summarizing sentence near the top of the page. Since all information in the summary sentence is also presented in the article body, we get a nice cloze-style question about the article contents by removing a word from the short summary.\nThe dataset's authors also replaced all named entities in the dataset by anonymous tokens which are further shuffled for each new batch. This forces the model to rely solely on information from the context document, not being able to transfer any meaning of the named entities between documents.\nThis restricts the task to one specific aspect of context-dependent question answering which may be useful however it moves the task further from the real application scenario, where we would like the model to use all information available to answer questions. Furthermore Chen et al. BIBREF5 have suggested that this can make about 17% of the questions unanswerable even by humans. They also claim that more than a half of the question sentences are mere paraphrases or exact matches of a single sentence from the context document. This raises a question to what extent the dataset can test deeper understanding of the articles.\nThe Children's Book Test BIBREF2 uses a different source - books freely available thanks to Project Gutenberg. Since no summary is available, each example consists of a context document formed from 20 consecutive sentences from the story together with a question formed from the subsequent sentence.\nThe dataset comes in four flavours depending on what type of word is omitted from the question sentence. Based on human evaluation done in BIBREF2 it seems that NE and CN are more context dependent than the other two types \u2013 prepositions and verbs. Therefore we (and all of the recent publications) focus only on these two word types.\nSeveral new datasets related to the (now almost standard) ones above emerged recently. We will now briefly present them and explain how the dataset we are introducing in this article differs from them.\nThe LAMBADA dataset BIBREF19 is designed to measure progress in understanding common-sense questions about short stories that can be easily answered by humans but cannot be answered by current standard machine-learning models (e.g. plain LSTM language models). This dataset is useful for measuring the gap between humans and machine learning algorithms. However, by contrast to our BookTest dataset, it will not allow us to track progress towards the performance of the baseline systems or on examples where machine learning may show super-human performance. Also LAMBADA is just a diagnostic dataset and does not provide ready-to-use question-answering training data, just a plain-text corpus which may moreover include copyrighted books making its use potentially problematic for some purposes. We are providing ready training data consisting of copyright-free books only.\nThe SQuAD dataset BIBREF20 based on Wikipedia and the Who-did-What dataset BIBREF21 based on Gigaword news articles are factoid question-answering datasets where a multi-word answer should be extracted from a context document. This is in contrast to the previous datasets, including CNN/DM, CBT, LAMBADA and our new dataset, which require only single-word answers. Both these datasets however provide less than 130,000 training questions, two orders of magnitude less than our dataset does.\nThe Story Cloze Test BIBREF22 provides a crowd-sourced corpus of 49,255 commonsense stories for training and 3,744 testing stories with right and wrong endings. Hence the dataset is again rather small. Similarly to LAMBADA, the Story Cloze Test was designed to be easily answerable by humans.\nIn the WikiReading BIBREF23 dataset the context document is formed from a Wikipedia article and the question-answer pair is taken from the corresponding WikiData page. For each entity (e.g. Hillary Clinton), WikiData contain a number of property-value pairs (e.g. place of birth: Chicago) which form the datasets's question-answer pairs. The dataset is certainly relevant to the community, however the questions are of very limited variety with only 20 properties (and hence unique questions) covering INLINEFORM0 of the dataset. Furthermore many of the frequent properties are mentioned at a set spot within the article (e.g. the date of birth is almost always in brackets behind the name of a person) which may make the task easier for machines. We are trying to provide a more varied dataset.\nAlthough there are several datasets related to task we are aiming to solve, they differ sufficiently for our dataset to bring new value to the community. Its biggest advantage is its size which can furthermore be easily upscaled without expensive human annotation. Finally while we are emphasizing the differences, models could certainly benefit from as diverse a collection of datasets as possible.\nMachine Learning Models\nA first major work applying deep-learning techniques to text comprehension was Hermann et al. BIBREF1 . This work was followed by the application of Memory Networks to the same task BIBREF2 . Later three models emerged around the same time BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 including our psr model BIBREF4 . The AS Reader inspired several subsequent models that use it as a sub-component in a diverse ensemble BIBREF8 ; extend it with a hierarchical structure BIBREF6 , BIBREF24 , BIBREF7 ; compute attention over the context document for every word in the query BIBREF10 or use two-way context-query attention mechanism for every word in the context and the query BIBREF11 that is similar in its spirit to models recently proposed in different domains, e.g. BIBREF25 in information retrieval. Other neural approaches to text comprehension are explored in BIBREF9 , BIBREF12 .\nPossible Directions for Improvements\nAccuracy in any machine learning tasks can be enhanced either by improving a machine learning model or by using more in-domain training data. Current state of the art models BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF11 improve over AS Reader's accuracy on CBT NE and CN datasets by 1-2 percent absolute. This suggests that with current techniques there is only limited room for improvement on the algorithmic side.\nThe other possibility to improve performance is simply to use more training data. The importance of training data was highlighted by the frequently quoted Mercer's statement that \u201cThere is no data like more data.\u201d The observation that having more data is often more important than having better algorithms has been frequently stressed since then BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 .\nAs a step in the direction of exploiting the potential of more data in the domain of text comprehension, we created a new dataset called BookTest similar to, but much larger than the widely used CBT and CNN/DM datasets.\nBookTest\nSimilarly to the CBT, our BookTest dataset is derived from books available through project Gutenberg. We used 3555 copyright-free books to extract CN examples and 10507 books for NE examples, for comparison the CBT dataset was extracted from just 108 books.\nWhen creating our dataset we follow the same procedure as was used to create the CBT dataset BIBREF2 . That is, we detect whether each sentence contains either a named entity or a common noun that already appeared in one of the preceding twenty sentences. This word is then replaced by a gap tag (XXXXX) in this sentence which is hence turned into a cloze-style question. The preceding 20 sentences are used as the context document. For common noun and named entity detection we use the Stanford POS tagger BIBREF27 and Stanford NER BIBREF28 .\nThe training dataset consists of the original CBT NE and CN data extended with new NE and CN examples. The new BookTest dataset hence contains INLINEFORM0 training examples and INLINEFORM1 tokens.\nThe validation dataset consists of INLINEFORM0 NE and INLINEFORM1 CN questions. We have one test set for NE and one for CN, each containing INLINEFORM2 examples. The training, validation and test sets were generated from non-overlapping sets of books.\nWhen generating the dataset we removed all editions of books used to create CBT validation and test sets from our training dataset. Therefore the models trained on the BookTest corpus can be evaluated on the original CBT data and they can be compared with recent text-comprehension models utilizing this dataset BIBREF2 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 .\nBaselines\nWe will now use our psr model to evaluate the performance gain from increasing the dataset size.\nAS Reader\nIn BIBREF4 we introduced the psr , which at the time of publication significantly outperformed all other architectures on the CNN, DM and CBT datasets. This model is built to leverage the fact that the answer is a single word from the context document. Similarly to many other models it uses attention over the document \u2013 intuitively a measure of how relevant each word is to answering the question. However while most previous models used this attention as weights to calculate a blended representation of the answer word, we simply sum the attention across all occurrences of each unique words and then simply select the word with the highest sum as the final answer. While simple, this trick seems both to improve accuracy and to speed-up training. It was adopted by many subsequent models BIBREF8 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF24 .\nLet us now describe the model in more detail. Figure FIGREF21 may help you in understanding the following paragraphs.\nThe words from the document and the question are first converted into vector embeddings using a look-up matrix INLINEFORM0 . The document is then read by a bidirectional GRU network BIBREF29 . A concatenation of the hidden states of the forward and backward GRUs at each word is then used as a contextual embedding of this word, intuitively representing the context in which the word is appearing. We can also understand it as representing the set of questions to which this word may be an answer.\nSimilarly the question is read by a bidirectional GRU but in this case only the final hidden states are concatenated to form the question embedding.\nThe attention over each word in the context is then calculated as the dot product of its contextual embedding with the question embedding. This attention is then normalized by the softmax function and summed across all occurrences of each answer candidate. The candidate with most accumulated attention is selected as the final answer.\nFor a more detailed description of the model including equations check BIBREF4 . More details about the training setup and model hyperparameters can be found in the Appendix.\nDuring our past experiments on the CNN, DM and CBT datasets BIBREF4 each unique word from the training, validation and test datasets had its row in the look-up matrix INLINEFORM0 . However as we radically increased the dataset size, this would result in an extremely large number of model parameters so we decided to limit the vocabulary size to INLINEFORM1 most frequent words. For each example, each unique out-of-vocabulary word is now mapped on one of 1000 anonymous tokens which are randomly initialized and untrained. Fixing the embeddings of these anonymous tags proved to significantly improve the performance.\nWhile mostly using the original AS Reader model, we have also tried introducing a minor tweak in some instances of the model. We tried initializing the context encoder GRU's hidden state by letting the encoder read the question first before proceeding to read the context document. Intuitively this allows the encoder to know in advance what to look for when reading over the context document.\nIncluding models of this kind in the ensemble helped to improve the performance.\nResults\nTable TABREF25 shows the accuracy of the psr and other architectures on the CBT validation and test data. The last two rows show the performance of the psr trained on the BookTest dataset; all the other models have been trained on the original CBT training data.\nIf we take the best psr ensemble trained on CBT as a baseline, improving the model architecture as in BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , continuing to use the original CBT training data, lead to improvements of INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 absolute on named entities and common nouns respectively. By contrast, inflating the training dataset provided a boost of INLINEFORM2 while using the same model. The ensemble of our models even exceeded the human baseline provided by Facebook BIBREF2 on the Common Noun dataset.\nOur model takes approximately two weeks to converge when trained on the BookTest dataset on a single Nvidia Tesla K40 GPU.\nDiscussion\nEmbracing the abundance of data may mean focusing on other aspects of system design than with smaller data. Here are some of the challenges that we need to face in this situation.\nFirstly, since the amount of data is practically unlimited \u2013 we could even generate them on the fly resulting in continuous learning similar to the Never-Ending Language Learning by Carnegie Mellon University BIBREF30 \u2013 it is now the speed of training that determines how much data the model is able to see. Since more training data significantly help the model performance, focusing on speeding up the algorithm may be more important than ever before. This may for instance influence the decision whether to use regularization such as dropout which does seem to somewhat improve the model performance, however usually at a cost of slowing down training.\nThanks to its simplicity, the psr seems to be training fast - for example around seven times faster than the models proposed by Chen et al. BIBREF5 . Hence the psr may be particularly suitable for training on large datasets.\nThe second challenge is how to generalize the performance gains from large data to a specific target domain. While there are huge amounts of natural language data in general, it may not be the case in the domain where we may want to ultimately apply our model.\nHence we are usually not facing a scenario of simply using a larger amount of the same training data, but rather extending training to a related domain of data, hoping that some of what the model learns on the new data will still help it on the original task.\nThis is highlighted by our observations from applying a model trained on the BookTest to Children's Book Test test data. If we move model training from joint CBT NE+CN training data to a subset of the BookTest of the same size (230k examples), we see a drop in accuracy of around 10% on the CBT test datasets.\nHence even though the Children's Book Test and BookTest datasets are almost as close as two disjoint datasets can get, the transfer is still very imperfect . Rightly choosing data to augment the in-domain training data is certainly a problem worth exploring in future work.\nOur results show that given enough data the AS Reader was able to exceed the human performance on CBT CN reported by Facebook. However we hypothesized that the system is still not achieving its full potential so we decided to examine the room for improvement in our own small human study.\nHuman Study\nAfter adding more data we have the performance on the CBT validation and test datasets soaring. However is there still potential for much further growth beyond the results we have observed?\nWe decided to explore the remaining space for improvement on the CBT by testing humans on a random subset of 50 named entity and 50 common noun validation questions that the psr ensemble could not answer correctly. These questions were answered by 10 non-native English speakers from our research laboratory, each on a disjoint subset of questions.. Participants had unlimited time to answer the questions and were told that these questions were not correctly answered by a machine, providing additional motivation to prove they are better than computers. The results of the human study are summarized in Table TABREF28 . They show that a majority of questions that our system could not answer so far are in fact answerable. This suggests that 1) the original human baselines might have been underestimated, however, it might also be the case that there are some examples that can be answered by machines and not by humans; 2) there is still space for improvement.\nA system that would answer correctly every time when either our ensemble or human answered correctly would achieve accuracy over 92% percent on both validation and test NE datasets and over 96% on both CN datasets. Hence it still makes sense to use CBT dataset to study further improvements of text-comprehension systems.\nConclusion\nFew ways of improving model performance are as solidly established as using more training data. Yet we believe this principle has been somewhat neglected by recent research in text comprehension. While there is a practically unlimited amount of data available in this field, most research was performed on unnecessarily small datasets.\nAs a gentle reminder to the community we have shown that simply infusing a model with more data can yield performance improvements of up to INLINEFORM0 where several attempts to improve the model architecture on the same training data have given gains of at most INLINEFORM1 compared to our best ensemble result. Yes, experiments on small datasets certainly can bring useful insights. However we believe that the community should also embrace the real-world scenario of data abundance.\nThe BookTest dataset we are proposing gives the reading-comprehension community an opportunity to make a step in that direction.\nTraining Details\nThe training details are similar to those in BIBREF4 however we are including them here for completeness.\nTo train the model we used stochastic gradient descent with the ADAM update rule BIBREF32 and learning rates of INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 . The best learning rate in our experiments was INLINEFORM3 . We minimized negative log-likelihood as the training objective.\nThe initial weights in the word-embedding matrix were drawn randomly uniformly from the interval INLINEFORM0 . Weights in the GRU networks were initialized by random orthogonal matrices BIBREF34 and biases were initialized to zero. We also used a gradient clipping BIBREF33 threshold of 10 and batches of sizes between 32 or 256. Increasing the batch from 32 to 128 seems to significantly improve performance on the large dataset - something we did not observe on the original CBT data. Increasing the batch size much above 128 is currently difficult due to memory constraints of the GPU.\nDuring training we randomly shuffled all examples at the beginning of each epoch. To speed up training, we always pre-fetched 10 batches worth of examples and sorted them according to document length. Hence each batch contained documents of roughly the same length.\nWe also did not use pre-trained word embeddings.\nWe did not perform any text pre-processing since the datasets were already tokenized.\nDuring training we evaluated the model performance every 12 hours and at the end of each epoch and stopped training when the error on the 20k BookTest validation set started increasing. We explored the hyperparameter space by training 67 different models The region of the parameter space that we explored together with the parameters of the model with best validation accuracy are summarized in Table TABREF29 .\nOur model was implemented using Theano BIBREF31 and Blocks BIBREF35 .\nThe ensembles were formed by simply averaging the predictions from the constituent single models. These single models were selected using the following algorithm.\nWe started with the best performing model according to validation performance. Then in each step we tried adding the best performing model that had not been previously tried. We kept it in the ensemble if it did improve its validation performance and discarded it otherwise. This way we gradually tried each model once. We call the resulting model a greedy ensemble. We used the INLINEFORM0 BookTest validation dataset for this procedure.\nThe algorithm was offered 10 models and selected 5 of them for the final ensemble."
